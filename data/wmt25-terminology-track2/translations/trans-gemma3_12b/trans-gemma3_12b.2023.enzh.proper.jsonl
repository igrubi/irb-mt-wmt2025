{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

逆境中的韌性\n\n在全球經濟增長放緩、利率維持高位以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的影響下——這不僅源於俄烏戰事和中美關係緊張，也包括中東地區衝突爆發——是2023年金融市場的關鍵主題。3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性銀行危機，進一步影響了市場氣氛。主要經濟體正努力應對收緊的貨幣狀況和對通脹走勢及利率前景的不確定性增加。中國內地的經濟復甦進度低於普遍市場預期，也增加了不確定性。\n\n隨著金融市場的波動和不可預測性成為「新常態」，香港再次展現了其眾所周知的適應能力，表現出卓越的韌性。自去年該市全面疫後重開以來，我們已投入大量工作，以吸引人們重返我們充滿活力的城市，並與香港重新建立聯繫。金管局通過舉辦一系列大型國際活動，例如國際金融領袖投資峰會以及與國際結算銀行（BIS）的會議，做出了貢獻，這些活動展示了我們充滿活力的城市，並有助於向全世界傳達訊息，即香港作為一個主要的國際金融中心（IFC），對商機敞開大門，並仍然是行動和創新的中心。 顯著跡象顯示逐步復甦，這得益於入境旅遊業的鼓舞人心的復甦和私人消費的改善，同時也得到穩健的勞工市場以及政府推出的各項支持措施的支持。 總體而言，2023年香港的本地生產總值增長從2022年的負值反彈至3.2%。\n\n金管局於2023年進入第四個十年。過去三十年間，經濟和金融市場的發展變化劇烈，科技的進步遠超乎任何人想像。 三十年來積累的寶貴經驗和智慧，使我們能夠充滿信心地迎接未來。 儘管面臨宏觀經濟挑戰和不確定的外部環境，金管局將繼續履行其在香港維護貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職責，並積極尋求發展機會，以鞏固這種穩定，並鞏固本港作為國際金融中心 的地位。\n\n香港特别行政區政府前任及現任財政司長，以及金管局前首長，於慶祝金管局三十週年記念活動中：（從左至右）任志剛先生、唐英年先生、曾蔭權先生、陳茂波先生、余偉文先生、梁錦松先生、曾俊華先生、陳德霖先生。\n\n# 聯匯制度——經受住風暴的考驗\n\n去年標誌著聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的四十週年，它是支持香港穩健貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。 四十年來，透明且有效的運作培育了市場對聯匯制度的信心及其可信度。 整個 året，港幣一直處於可兌換區內，港幣市場運作暢通，反映了市場對聯匯制度的強勁信心，這份信心也獲得國際貨幣基金組織和全球市場參與者的認可和表達。\n\n支持這份信心背後，是金管局積極開展公眾和市場溝通的工作，以及有效的監察。 過去一年，我們竭盡全力與主要持份者溝通，以促進對聯匯制度運作的清晰理解，尤其在波動時期，無論是源於經濟壓力還是政治不確定性，這都至關重要。 我們還加強了對貨幣體制 的監察，利用來自交易資料儲存庫的數據集以及銀行擴展的微數據，結合數據分析法和人工智能，以增強我們的能力，從而能夠更及時、更全面地分析金融穩定和宏觀審慎監察。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 一個主要的穩定來源\n\n儘管面臨諸多挑戰，包括高利率環境、持續的地緣政治緊張局勢以及嚴峻的信貸環境，香港的銀行體系在全年表現出穩定性，這得益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。\n\n截至2023年末，本地銀行合併總資本比率為21.1%，遠高於國際法定最低要求8%。截至2023年第四季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率上升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求100%。儘管特定分類貸款比率從2022年末的1.40%略微上升至2023年末的1.56%，但仍低於長期平均水平2.0%。增長主要受對內地民營房地產開發商的風險暴露所驅動；但由於多年來銀行審慎的風險管理，此類風險暴露程度普遍受到良好控制，銀行體系整體資產質素仍然穩健。\n\n二零二三年最讓市場參與者意想不到的，莫過於美國的銀行危機蔓延至歐洲，造成自二零零八年全球金融危機以來前所未見的系統性銀行危機。金管局在局勢演變過程中保持高度警惕，並採取了一系列預防措施，以限制對本地銀行和金融體系信心可能產生的不利外溢效應。 加上香港銀行所維持的強勁資本及流動性緩衝，我們的銀行體系在很大程度上未受此危機影響，即使全球金融市場動盪，仍保持韌性。 在這起事件過後，金管局進行了全面的內部檢討，旨在從中汲取經驗教訓，加強金管局的監管成效及應對銀行危機的敏捷性。\n\n雖然審慎的風險管理很重要，我們一直重申對銀行體系保持警惕，以支持實體經濟的需要。隨著預先批核還息不還本計劃於2023年7月有序退出，且新冠疫情的影響逐漸消退，金管局與銀行密切合作，確保貸款還款恢復正常，並為持續面臨壓力的借款人提供彈性。今年稍早，鑑於部分中小企在疫情結束後仍面臨營運挑戰，推出九項新措施，進一步協助它們從銀行獲得融資。\n\n鑑於金管局已審閱與本地物業市場相關的銀行物業貸款風險，金管局於2023年7月宣布自2009年引入以來，首次放寬針對住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。此項放寬提高了大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展與投資融資的按揭成數上限。其後，於2024年初，金管局又暫停了利率壓力測試的監管要求。\n\n金管局對金融機構的監管與時俱進。近年全球詐騙案件急劇增加，我們已顯著加強了應對新型詐騙手法的工作，推出一套全面的措施以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機構之間的訊息分享；加強對可疑交易的監控（包括實時詐騙監測及收緊支付卡認證）；賦予客戶更多支付卡控制權；以及透過發布保障消費者防詐騙約章，以及可疑識別代號警示機制，向客戶和公眾宣傳詐騙知識，並提高公眾防詐騙意識，尤其當發現高風險轉數快交易時會發出警告。\n\n鑒於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的蓬勃發展，金管局已與銀行業界合作，更廣泛地加強消費者及投資者保障，並提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，以及應對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦能力。 同時，所有主要銀行已顯著加強其應對及從破壞性勒索軟件攻擊中恢復的能力。 金管局與業界亦積極推展多個個人資料基建項目，例如「信資通」試驗計劃，以提升個人信貸資料服務，並推進跨境信貸資料互通項目，以促進企業的跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技和數碼化可以帶來巨大的機遇，前提是風險得到妥善管理。 借鑒先前在推廣合規科技方面的成功，金管局在2023年8月，在證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和保險業監管局的支持下，發布了新的金融科技推廣計劃，旨在促進金融機構在五個重點領域——財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能和區塊鏈技術—的金融科技進一步發展。 我們預期本地監管機構在未來幾年將繼續合作並與各行業密切合作，使香港金融業整體保持領先，並從動態的金融科技發展中獲益。\n\n# 香港作為一國際金融中心——行動與創新的中心。\n\n2023年，我們已完全走出疫情。香港不僅重返商務，更因全球投資者的歸來以及我們更強大的全球網絡，進一步鞏固了其作為全球領先的國際金融中心（IFC）的地位。 內地方面，我們藉著金管局（HKMA）人手編制三十週年紀念，舉辦一系列大型國際活動，邀請全球金融和銀行界高層參與，以 демонстрировать 香港的活力，並向全球投資者和金融機構傳達明確的信息，表明香港作為一個國際金融中心仍然具有重要性和不可或缺性，為他們尋求增長和創新提供支持。 值得一提的是，國際金融領袖投資峰會（Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit）在十一月重返香港，吸引了來自160多家全球金融機構的350多名國際和地區領袖。 在香港舉辦的其他重量級活動包括巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）的會議，以及兩場金管局與國際結算銀行合辦的會議（HKMA-BIS Conferences），這些會議是當年央行行長和銀行業監管機構規模最大的聚會之一。 這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。\n\n外部來看，2023 年也是香港積極拓展與傳統市場（包括美國及歐洲）聯繫，以及開拓如中東等新興市場的一年。我們在這些市場與相關監管機構及全球金融機構的高層會面，既向他們介紹香港和內地的機遇，也尋求香港的新合作機會。\n\n為了配合這些參與工作，我們積極貢獻於國際和區域論壇的工作，並擔任了一些領導職務。在過去的一年裡，我接受了擔任國際結算銀行（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體行長會議的主席，以及共同主席金融穩定理事會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組的邀請。我的同事們也在巴塞爾委員會、財務行動特別組織以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議等許多其他重要團體中擔任主席或共同主席。金管局（HKMA）在眾多區域和國際論壇中的領導地位，是對香港在中央銀行和監管方面的專業知識和貢獻的肯定，這有助於實現全球貨幣與金融穩定，同時也彰顯了香港作為國際金融中心的重要性。\n\n為進一步鞏固以上成就，我們必須將自身定位為具有前瞻性的國際金融中心，保持領先地位，以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來幾年將影響我們發展的三個長期趨勢，分別是內地的持續開放、綠色和可持續金融的發展以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持金融市場的發展，以捕捉這些長期趨勢所帶來的機遇，同時將我們的金融平台定位為提供領先服務，吸引更多企業來港。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作細節，讀者可參閱二零二三年可持續發展報告。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce,

經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年呈現正向增長，主要得力於入境旅遊業和本地需求的復甦。勞工市場隨著經濟復甦而持續改善，而通脹則維持溫和。預期2024年的經濟活動將進一步以適度速度復甦，儘管前景受到多重外部不確定因素的影響。\n\n香港的銀行體系在2023年仍然穩健，得益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。資產質素維持在健康的水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n在市場預期「高於預期且維持較長時間」的美國政策利率下，香港元在2023年主要在兌換保證區的弱方波動，而弱方兌換保證在二月中旬至五月初期間被觸發八次。港元外匯及貨幣市場維持穩定，並持續以平穩有序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年標誌著聯繫匯率制度的四十週年。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年中幫助香港度過了一系列衝擊和危機，展現了該制度的韌性和穩健性。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局迅速應對美國及歐洲3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機，從管理傳遞效應到完成內部檢討，從中汲取經驗教訓以應用於本地銀行體系，同時繼續專注於銀行信用、流動性及市場風險管理。 鑒於網絡威脅日益增加以及第三方提供的科技服務使用日益普及，金管局也與銀行密切合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強了對支付卡的使用者保護，並通過進一步修訂《銀行營運守則》及《保障消費者防詐騙約章》來實現此目標。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化面向高端專業投資者的銷售流程，並推出「跨境理財通」業務試點的改進措施，同時開始監察信託業務。此外，還啟動了「信資通」個人信貸資料服務的試點計劃。\n\n金管局在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的努力，彰顯了以風險為本的方法，針對最高風險的承諾。為應對日益增加的數碼騙案，金管局已加強生態圈各持份者的合作，透過推出實時欺詐監測、加強銀行與執法機構之間的資訊分享、加強公眾教育宣傳，以及在使用轉數快時推出新的可疑識別代號警示機制。與此同時，傀儡戶口網絡分析先導計劃已提升了監管科技能力。\n\n金管局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足及披露標準，並在銀行體系中提升專業能力方面做出了顯著努力。\n\n金管局亦積極推進其工作，以確保可信的處置機制，包括制定新的處置標準，就進入關鍵金融市場基建一事進行規範，並完成對吸收虧損能力政策標準落實情況的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第二屆國際金融領袖投資峰會及香港金融管理局–國際結算銀行高級別會議的成功結束，彰顯了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n金管局與內地及香港的相關機構緊密合作，加深和擴大香港與內地金融市場的互惠途徑。這包括優化跨境理財通，指定更多做市商參與債券通「南向通」，成功推出北向互換通，以及推行港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台莊家機制，所有這些都有助鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務中心地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，在債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融以及企業財資中心等領域取得了顯著進展。\n\n金管局持續在「金融科技2025」策略的各個方面取得顯著進展。mBridge項目進入最簡可行產品開發階段，數碼港元項目第一階段完成，商業數據通的使用量不斷增加，並已成功與政府數據來源連接。此外，公佈了新的金融科技推廣計劃，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能和區塊鏈技術於銀行體系中。同時，轉數快慶祝五周年，並持續見到更廣泛的採用和改進，包括與泰國的PromptPay進行跨境二維碼支付互聯等新功能。在制定穩定幣發行人監管制度方面也取得了顯著進展，並發佈了公眾諮詢文件，以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境波動且充滿挑戰，外匯基金仍能實現可觀的投資收入 2260 億港元，相當於 5.5% 的投資回報。\n\n金管局持續致力於資產多元化和負責任投資。 另一方面，長期增長組合自2009年成立以來，年率化內部回報率為11.8%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會和市場保持積極溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和運作的理解。\n\n內部，金管局致力於建立靈活且具備專業團隊，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升其數碼能力，以適應變遷，並確保其政策和倡議的有效執行。"}

Jul\n\n金管局將外匯基金票據及債券的發售時間，由上午11時30分改為下午4時，縮小發售與贖回的日內時間差距，以協助銀行同業市場更有效率。\n\n# 銀行\n\n# 二月九日\n\n金管局更新《交易監察、篩查和可疑交易舉報指引文件》，以配合認可機構為提升這些控制領域的成效與效率而進行的變動，並支持更多應用科技以產生具針對性的提示。\n\n# 二月二十二日\n\n八十%保證產品、九十%保證產品及特別一百分百貸款保證計劃（中小企融資擔保計劃）的申請期已延遲至2024年3月底。\n\n# 3月22至23日\n\n金管局舉辦為期兩天的巴塞爾銀行監管委員會會議。這是自2020年疫情爆發以來，委員會首次在總部以外舉行的實體會議，旨在討論最新的銀行業監管政策，以協助維持全球金融穩定。\n\n# 三月二十四日\n\n金管局與國際結算銀行（國際結算銀行）合辦一場在香港舉行的會議，主題為在創新時代下與時並進的銀行業監管。\n\n這項會議標誌著香港在取消所有社交距離措施及香港與內地邊境重開後，首次舉辦的大規模國際金融監管機構會議，吸引了來自超過25個經濟體的中央銀行監管機構及金融機構的100多名資深官員。\n\n# 21  年四月\n\n金管局舉辦一場高層交流會，出席者包括金管局、香港警務處（警務處）及零售銀行的資深代表，並宣布了五項打擊詐騙措施。\n\n金管局同時啟動一項反洗錢監管科技試驗，利用多間銀行的數據進行傀儡戶口網絡分析，以識別並減輕傀儡戶口網絡在系統性層面的風險，並在打擊洗錢 (AML) 工作中取得更好的成效。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年及以後的優先事項\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預計將持續以穩健的步伐復甦，受益於持續復甦的入境旅遊業、公共基建項目和穩定的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不確定性，尤其與美國未來政策利率走勢、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢有關。 儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性和多年來累計的充足儲備，仍然處於有利地位，能夠應對不利的衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視維護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。展望未來，我們將對不確定的宏觀投資環境保持警惕，力求迅速識別新興風險並以靈活的方式應對。 同時，我們將尋求機會，並創造政策空間，以進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。 在管理外匯基金於此充滿挑戰的投資環境中，我們將繼續謹慎投資，並保持彈性，適時採取防禦性部署，並維持高度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性和完整性。\n\n近年來全球經濟的不確定性似乎將持續至2024年。金管局將密切關注最新發展，並時刻警惕潛在風險，以維護金融體系的韌性和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕。\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的諸多不確定性、不斷演變的地緣政治風險以及不均衡的經濟復甦而出現波動。2024年也是一個重要的選舉年，世界各地將舉行許多主要選舉。這些選舉的結果可能會進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來積累的緩衝，處於有利地位，能夠抵禦不利的衝擊。金管局也具備能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續努力密切監察本地及外部環境中出現的風險及漏洞，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。我們還將進行經濟研究，探討影響香港經濟的議題，評估及應對與這些議題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n二零二三年，全球新舊地緣政治緊張局勢紛起，部分問題仍未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定性，預計將持續至二零二四年。高利率是全球經濟面貌的特徵，而利率在進入二零二四年時仍維持高位。在銀行體系內，持續推動數碼化以及實施新技術，包括人工智能，帶來了許多優點，但也帶來了新的營運和網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在如此動盪的政治、經濟和技術環境下，金管局致力於確保銀行承受衝擊的能力，透過其持續的監管工作。 同時，我們將繼續加強和完善我們的銀行監管和法規框架及政策，並將考慮到技術發展、客戶期望的變化，以及國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信貸、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑒於日益嚴峻的宏觀經濟環境，金管局將特別關注認可機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及監控的成效，尤其是在貸款分類、撥備及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行和商業界保持密切溝通，以確保認可機構在承擔審慎的信貸風險管理和履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當的平衡，貫穿整個經濟周期。 尤其，我們將透過銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，跟進2024年3月推出的九項新措施，以協助中小企從銀行獲得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇，可能會增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動。金管局將把保持警惕作為優先事項，並將繼續有效監察認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 針對從2023年銀行危機中汲取的教訓的後續行動\n\n金管局將會落實因應美國及歐洲2023年銀行危機而進行的內部檢討中識別的後續行動。 這些行動旨在進一步提升監管成效，並增強其應對銀行危機的能力。 內容包括加強認可機構在金管局監管審查程序下，銀行帳內的利率風險的風險捕捉，提升認可機構應對流動性受壓情況的準備，以應對持續數碼化轉型的銀行服務，簡化金管局的危機管理流程，以及進一步提升與其他監管機構之間和跨境的監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監控 認可機構 在達成完全符合《監管政策手冊》 (SPM) OR-2 模組「運作穩健性」方面的進展，並評估和基準銀行對可信擾流的容忍限度，以增強 銀行體系 的整體穩健性。 關於網絡風險，我們將監督 認可機構 根據《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》進行新一輪的自我評估，並監控 認可機構 實施三重數據備份，以提升其在面臨破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑒於銀行營運數字化進程加速，金管局將密切關注生成式人工智能及分布式賬本技術等先進技術應用所衍生的新風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，建立一個靈活且預防性的機制，以應對數碼騙案日益增多的趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2024年，為維護銀行體系的完整性及建立客戶信心，金管局將針對高風險領域，並優先考慮風險為本的監管更新，包括發布指引以支持對政治人物要求變動的有效、風險為本的實施，以及支持穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。我們亦會發布指引，協助認可機構優化其交易監察系統，並促進人工智能的負責任使用，並專注於針對高端洗錢的監控工作。為加強對數碼騙案的回應，並減少受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就將銀行間信息分享範圍從企業戶口擴展至個人戶口的建議案，並根據收到的回覆，跟進所需的立法修訂。我們將通過匯集多間銀行相關的數據，並將其與現有生態系統欺詐分析系統連接，全面構建傀儡戶口網絡分析3.0。這將有助於更快速地跨銀行作出回應，並進一步提升我們以數據為本的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監管，使我們能夠更迅速、更果斷地採取行動，應對系統性洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集風險。\n\n# 財富管理及公積金相關業務\n\n在2024年，金管局將加強對認可機構（AIs）在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務行為的現場審查和離線監察。更具體地說，我們將重點關注跨境理財通（跨境理財通）業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考最新的市場發展以及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n金管局將與其他監管機構及銀行業密切溝通，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售相關監管標準提供指引，適時作出安排。 尤其為支持虛擬資產（VA）行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為虛擬資產行業而設的監管制度健全、全面且平衡。\n\n金管局將促成及監察業界就跨境理財通的改進措施的落實，並將繼續與業界及相關監管機構溝通，以進一步完善此計劃。我們亦將繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適時整合及闡明指引，以促進業界的合規。除信託業務外，我們還將開始根據《證券及期貨條例》，對為證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）授權的集體投資計劃提供托管服務的認可機構的第13類受規管活動進行監察，此項監察將於2024年10月2日生效。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局旨在根據《儲值支付工具條例》（支付條例）、《金融市場基建的原則》（基建原則）以及支付及金融基建委員會（支付及金融基建委員會）發布的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基建的安全性及效率。我們將繼續參與支付及金融基建委員會-國際證券監管組織（IOSCO）的《基建原則》實施監察及評估工作，以及參與其他國際工作小組，討論實施新的、創新的金融市場基建相關舉措。我們也會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並適時審閱和加強我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際慣例以及市場和科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續加強及完善其銀行監管和監察框架及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 香港推行巴塞爾標準\n\n預計，實施《巴塞爾協定三最終改革方案》（最終方案）的《銀行業（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行業（披露）規則》（BDR）的建議修訂，將於2025年1月1日，經立法會通過修訂後的規則後生效。 2024年，金管局將繼續準備實施這些規則所需的支援指引、銀行業申報表及標準披露範本及表格。 尤其，我們計劃：\n- 於2024年第二季諮詢業界，就《監管政策手冊單元CA-B-3》關於「逆周期緩衝資本」（CCyB）– 私營部門信貸風險地域配置及申報表MA(BS) 25「有關逆周期緩衝資本的季報」的修訂案進行討論，以反映實施最終方案及修訂的國際銀行業務統計資料所帶來的後續變動；及\n- 最終確定執行市場及信貸估值調整風險新標準的僅申報要求的文件，該要求將於2024年7月1日生效。\n\n那些針對《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（風險承擔限度規則）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》（流動性規則）的建議修正案，其中大部分與修訂後的資本規則（BCR）下《最終方案》的實施有關，也計劃於2025年1月1日生效。金管局計劃於2024年完成相關監管報告的建議後續修正。\n\n同時，隨著巴塞爾銀行監管委員會於2022年12月及2023年12月分別發布有關銀行加密資產風險承擔的資本規則新標準及相關的針對性修訂，預計將於2025年實施該標準。金管局將研究就多項規則，包括資本規則、披露規則、風險承擔限度規則及流動性規則，可能需要的立法修訂，並於2025年上半年就所需的規則修訂進行法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策和風險管理指引\n\n金管局計劃根據二零二三年三月美國及歐洲的銀行危機所學，以及監管要求和國際標準的發展，更新多個監管政策手冊模組。這些模組包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart Money Management

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90%

建立明確的機構管治架構，並實施高問責性；\n- 採取嚴謹的監控措施，以管理風險，並確保各級員工及日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 堅持高透明度及開放政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局和香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府不可或缺的一部分，但能夠以與公務員不同的條款聘用員工，以吸引具有適當經驗和專業知識的人才。金管局總裁及其職員屬於公職人員。在日常工作中，金管局在相關法定權力賦予或授權予金融管理專員的範圍內，享有高度的自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制結構；一份財政司司長致金融管理專員的函件，日期為2003年6月25日，明確指出此目標應為貨幣穩定，定義為維持在港幣7.80兌一美元左右的穩定匯率，並透過貨幣發行局制度來實現。金融管理專員需自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括制定策略、工具及執行方式。金融管理專員亦有維護香港貨幣體制的穩定及健全的責任。\n\n財政司司長，在財經事務及庫務局的協助下，對維持香港金融體系及香港作為國際金融中心地位的穩定性和完整性的政策負有責任。為支持這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的總體穩定和有效運作；\n- 配合其他相關機構，促進債務市場的發展；\n- 關於法定紙幣及硬幣的發行和流通事宜；\n- 通過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下運作這些系統，以促進金融基建的安全和效率；以及\n- 配合其他相關機構，努力提升對香港貨幣及金融體系以及發展市場措施的信心，從而有助於強化香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長控制。金融管理專員受財政司司長委託，對外匯基金的使用及基金的投資管理負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n金管局在日常運作及為實現政府決定的政策目標所使用的途徑上所享有的自主權，同時也伴隨著高度的問責性與透明度。\n\n金管局致力服務香港，透過促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定、有效管理官方儲備，以及發展和監管健全且多元化的金融基建，來履行職責。 這些過程有助於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並促進香港的經濟福祉。\n\n金管局 若要善盡其職，必須得到社會的信任。因此，金管局 非常重視向公眾解釋其政策和工作的責任，並盡一切努力處理與 金管局 職責相關的社會各界關注。 尤其是在傳統及社交媒體上， 金管局 會及時澄清關於 金管局 政策的虛假信息和謠言。\n\n金管局須透過財政司司長（其委任金融管理專員）以及立法會通過的、規範金融管理專員權力和職責的法律，向香港市民負責。金管局亦深知自身有更廣泛的責任，以促進公眾對其角色和目標的理解，並時刻關注社會的關注。在日常運作及與社會各界接觸時，金管局秉持透明度及開放性的政策。此政策有兩個主要目標：\n- 盡可能地向金融業及公眾提供關於金管局工作的全面資訊，但需考慮市場敏感性、商業保密以及法定限制，不得洩露機密資訊；及\n- 確保金管局與所服務的社會保持聯繫，並對其作出回應。\n\n金管局旨在於其透明度安排上遵循國際最佳 практики。它與傳媒保持廣泛的聯繫，並發布一系列期刊及專題刊物，內容有中英文版本。金管局的雙語網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）刊載大量金管局出版物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件，此外，還設有專門的經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他主題的版塊。社交媒體平台也被用於在數位時代更有效地與公眾溝通。金管局在其寫字樓內設有資訊中心，包括圖書館和展覽區，每週開放六天。關於金管局在公眾溝通和參與方面的工作，更多資訊請參閱「機構職能」一章第185至193頁。\n\n多年來，金管局已逐步增加有關外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目的資訊披露的詳細程度和頻率。自一九九九年起，金管局參與國際貨幣基金組織的數據公布特殊標準計劃，為中央銀行而設。金管局會發佈外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣發行委員會的會議記錄，以及貨幣發行局運作的報告。自一九九六年起，金管局網站已發佈銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係在促進問責性及透明度方面扮演重要角色。金管局總裁承諾每年三次出席立法會財經事務委員會，向立法會議員匯報金管局的工作，並回答議員的提問。金管局代表不時出席立法會委員會及小組會議，解釋及討論特定議題，並協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 控制\n\n金管局採用嚴謹的內部及外部監控機制，以確保其維持高標準的員工行為、審慎的風險管理，以及恰當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否充分及有效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 《行為守則》\n\n《行為守則》已制定，旨在指導員工履行其道德與法律責任，以確保員工行為在各個層面均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n各部門及 подразделения 均須對其工作流程所涉及的風險進行識別及評估，並建立適當的監控措施，以確保 金管局 日常運作的順暢。此舉構成了風險管理的 第一度防線。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在企業層面進行，而風險委員會，由金管局總裁主持，是機構風險管理框架的重要基石。\n\n各功能單位識別出的潛在及新興風險，以及其制定的監控措施和緩解策略的充分性，均會匯報並在風險委員會中討論，風險委員會將決定適當的後續行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處會獨立評估各功能單位治理、風險管理及監控程序的 adequateness 和 effectiveness，並就改進範疇提供建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第七條，香港特區政府的審計署會審核《外匯基金》的財務報表。審計署不會就此收取費用。 《外匯基金》的審核財務報表將納入《年報》。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

資產市場在收緊的金融狀況和疲弱的市場氣氛中維持低迷。 預計2024年的經濟活動將以適度的速度進一步復甦，儘管前景受到多重外部不確定因素的影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n經歷過前一年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩健增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。 內地方面，受益於改善的勞工市場狀況以及政府推出的多項支持措施，例如消費券計劃和一系列推廣活動，私人消費顯著回升。 儘管金融狀況收緊，整體投資支出仍錄得顯著增長，相較於去年同期為低基數。 外部方面，香港的服務輸出有所反彈，主要歸功於入境旅遊業的強勁復甦。 然而，其對增長的正面影響被強勁的出境旅遊業所抵消，後者被計作服務輸入。 另一方面，貨物出口在疲弱的外部需求下表現平平，並對香港的本地生產總值（本地生產總值）增長造成拖累。\n\n圖表一 實質本地生產總值增長之貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表1 根據支出項目劃分的實質本地生產總值增長（按期增長）\n註：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整的按季增減幅度沒有數據。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n本地通脹於2023年維持溫和，由於外部價格壓力逐漸緩解，而國內成本壓力大致上受到控制，儘管隨著經濟復甦而略為上升（圖2）1。 總體而言，2023年核心通脹率和整體通脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n二零二三年，勞工市場狀況進一步改善，失業率降至十年低位的百分之二點八，七月份達到這個水平，其後餘下的月份亦維持低水平（圖3）。勞工需求和勞動人口均有所增加，總就業人數的上升（圖3）和勞動人口的增加分別反映了這一點。鑒於香港的勞動力短缺，政府於二零二三年推出多項勞工輸入計劃及人才吸引計劃。同時，由於勞工市場條件緊張，名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長率逐漸上升至疫情前的水平。\n\n圖表 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n年初穩定後，本港股市在下半年轉趨沉悶。延續了2022年底的反彈，恒生指數在2023年1月27日上漲至年內最高收位22,689點。其後回落，並在12月進一步跌至低位（圖4），反映了由於三月美國及瑞士銀行體系問題，以及下半年全球經濟前景疲弱和金融狀況收緊，導致的薄弱市場氣氛。恒生指數全年收於17,047點，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌著連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首四個月受益於內地和香港恢復常態而出現反彈，但隨後因按揭利率上升和疲弱的市場氣氛而有所回落。總體而言，2023年樓價按年下跌6.9%，而成交量進一步下降4.5%，錄得43,002個單位的新低。置業負擔能力仍然吃力，儘管隨著樓價的下調調整而略有改善。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面臨挑戰，寫字樓、零售商舖和分層工廠大廈的價格進一步下跌。由於空置率高企，加上在家工作安排日益普及和供應量大，寫字樓的租金仍然承受壓力。另一方面，隨著入境旅遊業的復甦和私人消費的改善，零售商舖的租金在2023年上漲。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：地政總署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零二四年，香港經濟預計將繼續以穩健步伐復甦。 隨著處理能力持續提升以及政府致力推廣大型活動，入境旅遊業預計會進一步擴展，而本地消費活動則應會得到穩定的勞工市場的支持。 政府將推動的各項基建項目，亦將為經濟提供支持。 另一方面，香港的貨物出口預計將隨著全球科技周期預期的回升而穩定。 政府預測本地生產總值將於二零二四年穩步增長 2.5% – 3.5%。 然而，前景受到多重風險及不確定因素的影響，包括源於美國政策利率走勢、科技周期復甦的步伐、全球經濟增長的前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n本地通脹預計於2024年仍會溫和，外部價格壓力減弱有助抵消本地成本上升的壓力，同時經濟復甦並房租持續上升。市場普遍預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府預測整體及底層通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞工市場預計將受到持續的經濟復甦所支持，而各項勞工輸入及人才吸引計劃將繼續有助於緩解各行各業的勞動力短缺。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n二零二三年，香港銀行體系面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國及歐洲3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地及香港經濟復甦速度低於預期。儘管面臨多重不利因素，香港銀行體系依然穩健，並持續得到強勁的資本及流動性緩衝的支持。儘管特定分類貸款比率有所上升，銀行體系的資產質素仍然保持健康。 銀行盈利能力顯著改善，主要得益於淨利息收入的增加。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系 的特定分類貸款比率在2023年末上漲至1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%上升，同期逾期及經重組貸款比率增至1.24%，較0.85%上升（圖表5）。與內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率也從一年前的2.26%上升至2023年末的2.58%。特定分類貸款比率的上升主要歸因於對內地房地產發展商的風險敞口評級下調。儘管如此，銀行所保留的撥備仍然充足。信貸撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與特定分類貸款的比率）在2023年末為75%。如果將為特定分類貸款所持有的抵押品總市值納入考量，調整後的信貸撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。同時，住宅按揭貸款和信用卡貸款的拖欠比率在2023年末分別保持在0.08%和0.30%的低位（圖表6）。\n\n圖表

利潤趨勢\n\n銀行體系在2023年錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行整體除稅前經營溢利在該年上升了62.1%，而除稅後平均資產回報率從同期0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利的改善主要歸功於淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及與前一年輕微虧損相比，2023年持有作交易的投資大幅增長。然而，貸款減值撥備的增加（+28%）在一定程度上抵消了這一影響，因為為新的分類貸款設定了特殊準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行淨息差在2023年擴大至1.68%，比一年前的1.31%有所擴大（圖8）。同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率在2023年下降至38.8%，而2022年為48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

鑒於借貸成本上升和全球經濟前景疲軟，貸款需求低迷，貸款總額在2023年下降了3.6%。 在貸款總額中，用於香港的貸款基本保持穩定（-0.4%），而用於香港以外地區和貿易融資的貸款分別下降了10.4%和13.1%。 與內地相關的貸款在2023年下降了6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，存款總額在2023年上升了5.1%，與2022年的增長1.7%相比。由於貸款總額下降，而存款總額增長，導致貸存比率在2023年末降至62.8%，較前一年的68.5%有所降低（圖表10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2023年維持了良好的資本化水平。截至2023年底，本地註冊認可機構（認可機構）的合併總資本比率為21.1%，較前一年為20.1%。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11）。這兩個比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率在2023年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖表 10 銀行體系的貸款與存款\n來源：金管局\n\n圖表 11

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart Money

貨幣穩定\n\n在2023年，在市場預期「美國政策利率」將維持高位的氛圍中，港元主要在「弱方兌換保證」的弱勢一側波動，在二月中旬至五月初期間觸發八次。自五月起，港元有所回升，年末的匯率約為7.8的「中間價水平」附近。在「聯繫匯率制度」下，該制度於2023年慶祝成立四十週年，「香港銀行同業拆息」通常追蹤其美元對應利率，同時也受到本地供需影響。總體而言，「港元外匯及貨幣市場」保持穩定，交易順暢有序。作為香港「貨幣與金融穩定」的基石，「聯繫匯率制度」一次又一次地展現了其「實際職員人數」和抗禦外部衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港的貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣與美元在外匯市場上的匯率維持在每美元7.75–7.85港元的區間內，保持穩定的外部匯率價值。該貨幣體制結構的特點是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，並且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全一致。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書，其完全擔保了三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘，它是保存在金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和；以及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（外匯基金票據及債券）。\n\n港幣匯率的穩定性，是透過自動利率調整機制以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（兌換保證）來維持的。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局隨時準備以每美元七點七五港元（或每美元七點八五港元）的匯率，向（或從）銀行買賣港幣，以美元為交換，總結餘將擴大（或收縮），從而壓低（或推高）港幣利率，協助將港幣匯率拉回至七點七五至七點八五的目標範圍內。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期「高於預期且維持較長時間」的美國政策利率下，港元在2023年持續疲軟，且大部分時間在弱方兌換保證附近波動。從二月中旬至五月初，弱方兌換保證被觸發八次。港元匯率在五月初至七月初期間回升了一些實際職員人數，部分原因是來自上市公司的股息支付需求以及企業年中資金需求。此後，港元主要受到本地資金需求的變化所驅動，例如透過港股通南向的買入流動，年末的匯率在中間價水平7.8附近波動（圖1）。總體而言，港元匯率市場在2023年持續正常運作。\n\n圖一 2023 年市場匯率\n\n從二月至五月，金管局總共以弱方兌換保證方式購買了515億港元，應銀行要求，並依照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計而進行。反映弱方兌換保證的觸發，總結餘從2022年底的963億港元下降至2023年底的450億港元。同期，外匯基金票據及債券的未償餘額略微增加，從1,2004億港元上升至1,2455億港元。因此，總結餘與未償外匯基金票據及債券的總額從2022年底的1,2967億港元下降至2023年底的1,2904億港元（圖2）。貨幣基礎整體上仍完全以外匯儲備為抵押。\n\n圖表 2 總結餘（結餘總額（貼現窗前））及 2023 年外匯基金未償還票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）通常追蹤其美元對應貨幣的利率。隨著美國在2023年首七個月持續加息，HIBORs普遍上漲（見圖3）。 截至年末，隔夜、一個月及三個月的HIBORs分別上升了286、92和16個基點，至6.09%、5.27%和5.15%。\n\n繼美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，基本利率已累計上調四次，總計上調一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上調至5.75%。1 在零售層面，隨著美國政策利率上升，許多銀行在5月初和7月底分別上調了最優惠貸款利率12.5個基點。 此外，部分銀行在年內也提高了以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的新批按揭利率的上限，新批按揭貸款的平均利率從2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。 總體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。 貼現窗借貸額增至2023年的388億港元，較2022年的84億港元顯著增加，且相關使用情況並未發現異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度是香港金融體系穩定的重要支柱，已歷時四十多年，並在挑戰中展現出其實際職員人數和韌性。儘管美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，但港元外匯及貨幣市場持續有序運作，反映了聯匯制度的穩健。政府堅定地支持聯匯制度。在二零二三年《對外部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）再次強調，聯匯制度的信譽得益於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、健全的金融監管及監察、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系持續平穩運作，流動性狀況和資本化水平均遠超國際標準。為確保銀行體系具有韌性，金管局一直密切監控銀行對信貸、流動性和利率風險的管理以及壓力測試結果，並維持其對銀行借款的監管力度。\n\n為提高貨幣準備金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金的特定資產已被分配用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）從2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的112.71%高位，超過了112.5%的觸發上限（圖4）。這主要反映了由於上半年觸發弱方兌換保證導致總結餘收縮。 根據外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，以及負債證明書的贖回，資產從支持組合轉移到投資組合，將支持比率降至5月8日的約109.97%。此後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收於110.73%。在聯匯制度下，雖然外匯基金的特定資產已被指定用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財政資源，以及穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖4

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee

銀行穩定性\n\n香港的銀行體系在2023年儘管面臨多重挑戰，包括美國及歐洲發生的3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍然保持強勁和韌性。金管局對3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機迅速作出回應，從管理傳遞效應到完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管流程和解決框架等領域），從中汲取經驗教訓，並繼續專注於認可機構的信用、流動性及市場風險管理。 鑒於網絡威脅不斷升級以及第三方提供的科技服務使用日益普及，金管局也與認可機構密切合作，以增強其營運和網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強了就支付卡一事的消費者保護，透過進一步修訂《銀行營運守則》以及推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章》來實現。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化了面向高端專業投資者的銷售流程，並對「跨境理財通」業務試點進行了改進，同時開始監察信託業務。已推出一項試點計劃，為提供信資通的個人信貸資料服務做準備。\n\n金管局（HKMA）在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，彰顯了以風險為本的方法，針對最高風險的承諾。為應對日益嚴重的數碼騙案，金管局已加強生態圈各持份者的合作，透過推出實時欺詐監測，並擴大公私營部門信息分享夥伴關係的範圍，包括欺詐及洗錢情報工作小組。一個突破性平台的推出，將有助於促進銀行間的信息分享，從而應對傀儡戶口網絡的風險。同時，金管局也與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理日益增加的與欺詐相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對各種騙局的認識，包括在使用轉數快時的可疑識別代號警示機制。與此同時，傀儡戶口網絡分析先導計劃也提升了監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足及披露標準。同時，也致力於提升銀行體系的專業能力，吸引和培養未來的專業人才，並提升現有從業者的技能。此外，香港存款保障委員會完成了有關存款保障計劃建議改進的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局持續推進確保可信賴處置機制的工作。制定了與連接關鍵金融市場基建相關的新處置標準，並完成了對實施吸收虧損能力政策標準經驗的回顧。在與銀行就處置進行規劃方面取得了顯著進展，以應對提前終止風險及運作持續性。金管局同時持續參與國際政策倡議和區域處置合作。\n\n# 目的\n\n金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的安全性與穩定性。 實現此目標取決於一個高度穩健的金融體系，能夠為香港經濟所需的金融服務提供保障。\n\n銀行或會透過其業務營運方式影響金融穩定，在極端情況下，更可能因應急時而無秩序地倒閉。 金融管理專員作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保持牌銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機發生時恢復其地位，從而有助於預防倒閉。 金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監察，並有權在香港授權持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構 (AIs)。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理專員作為處置機制當局，致力確保在認可機構出現不可持續的情況下，其失敗能夠有序處理。為達此目的，香港已建立一套為金融機構而設的處置機制，根據該處置機制，金管局是認可機構的處置機制當局，以及其他類型的機構。為了在香港推行處置機制，制定處置規則和政策標準，進行處置規劃以消除認可機構可處置性的障礙，並發展金管局處理陷入困境的認可機構的能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監察若干金融市場基建。在監察金融市場基建方面，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。使金融市場基建更能抵禦金融危機，有助於保護香港的貨幣及金融體系免受金融市場基建中斷可能造成的 destabilising effects。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n在年內，金管局批出兩間以外地註冊成立的銀行的一項銀行牌照和一張受限制銀行牌照。金管局同時批准四間外地交易平台營運商的貨幣經紀人認可，並撤銷了先前授予一間貨幣經紀人的認可。金管局在年內撤銷了五間持牌銀行授權。\n\n關於認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱附件及第313至316頁及第322至325頁的D至F表格。\n\n# 銀行三級制審查\n\n二零二三年，金管局對香港的銀行三級制進行了全面的審查，旨在簡化香港的銀行體系結構。 審查結果顯示，銀行三級制已變得複雜於實現最初的目標，即在銀行業入門的靈活性與保護小額存款人的平衡。 隨後，金管局於六月展開為期三個月的諮詢，就將銀行三級制簡化為兩級制，將接受存款公司並入從事牌照銀行業務的銀行，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二級別的建議案。 回應者普遍支持該建議。\n\n# supervisory activities 的總覽\n\n在2023年，金管局進行了177次離地審核，涵蓋了廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、機構管治和風險管理。作為金管局持續加強風險管治的努力的一部分，與認可機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間還舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了以外地活動外，金管局會定期對一系列認可機構的業務進行現場審查。 由於高利率環境以及部分內地房地產發展商的債務違約，信用風險管理是重點關注的範疇。 業務運作風險和科技風險的管理也是另一個主要重點，因為認可機構對科技的採用進一步加速。 金管局同時加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出新一輪以氣候相關風險治理為主題的審查，以及一系列諮詢會，向認可機構提供監管指導。\n\n二零二三年三月開始於美國和歐洲發生的銀行危機，在規模和範圍上，是自二零零八年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性銀行危機。金管局在危機演變過程中保持高度警惕，並採取了一系列預防措施，以確保任何潛在的後遺症不會動搖本地銀行和金融體系對信心。 該事件發生後，金管局進行了內部檢討，並參考從危機中獲得的觀察和經驗。 根據該檢討，金管局制定了詳細的行動計劃，以將吸取的教訓納入其中，旨在加強監管成效，並增強其處理銀行危機的能力。 更多關於金管局在這方面工作的細節，請參閱第95頁的「流動性及市場風險」。\n\n在監察合規方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務進行了現場審查，並就消費者保護事宜進行了補充。同時，對評估風險較高或新舉措的領域進行了主題審查。\n\n表1 載有金管局 2023 年的監管活動概要。\n\n表1 監管活動總結\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n2023年，貸款總額減少了3.6%，與2022年的下降幅度3.0%相比。表2顯示了貸款及墊款增長的細節。中國內地相關貸款在2023年減少了6.6%，降至4,226億港元（見表3）。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款增長\n\n表3 中國內地相關貸款增長\n\n在2023年，金管局加強了監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理措施的做法，原因是利率高企以及內地物業市場持續疲弱。 銀行體系的資產質素在該年有所惡化，但仍屬可控。截至2023年末，銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%上升。與內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則從2022年末的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在年內，金管局進行了有針對性和主題性的審查，以評估認可機構的風險管理，重點關注對脆弱行業的風險敞口、保費融資、對香港境外營運的信用風險監管以及對非金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 減輕銀行客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n金管局及銀行體系中小企業貸款協調機制於七月宣布，將有秩序地結束《預先批核還息不還本計劃》。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在幫助合資格的公司渡過疫情。 考慮到商業界的意見，部分本金還款選項已得到加強，以協助公司逐步恢復正常還款。 即使在疫情結束後，某些行業或個別借款人仍然面臨挑戰，銀行將繼續根據個案情況提供本金還款寬限或其他適當的信貸減輕措施。\n\n金管局也鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但因個別情況面臨現金流壓力的企業的融資需求時， проявлять понимание。金管局提醒銀行在處理遇到償還問題的企業時，遵循「香港處理企業困難」的指引，以便各銀行在涉及的貸款人的共同利益中協作行動。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起實施的幾輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，強化了銀行對其物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行體系應對物業價格急劇調整所帶來挑戰的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款按值（LTV）比例為57%，與2009年9月首次引入逆周期措施前的64%相比，有所下降（圖1）。2023年新按揭的平均償債比率（DSR）維持在40%的低位，與2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%相比。\n\n於七月七日，金管局考量物業價格、成交量及本地及外部經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。這是自二零零九年起推行相關措施以來，首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。調整包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款成數上限，以及根據按揭申請人資產水平評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款成數上限。此外，取消了對主要收入來源來自香港以外地區的按揭申請人，降低適用最高貸款成數及DSR上限十個百分點的要求。金管局亦取消了當按揭申請人的按揭融資總額超出金管局正常允許的最高貸款成數上限二十個百分點時，需要應用減少五個百分點的DSR上限的要求。\n\n圖一

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n在2023年，金管局採取多管齊下的方法，以實現顯著進展，鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n兩項大型活動的成功，分別是國際金融領袖投資峰會和香港金融管理局–國際結算銀行高級別會議，鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生了傳遞效應。\n\n金管局與內地及香港的相關機構共同努力，加深和擴展香港與內地金融市場之間的互惠途徑。這包括對粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通計劃進行優化，指定更多做市商參與債券通「南向通」，成功推出北向互換通，以及推行港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台莊家機制。 這些舉措有效強化了香港的橋樑地位，並鞏固了本港作為全球離岸人民幣業務中心的角色。\n\n金管局在提升香港金融平台競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涉及債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融以及企業財資中心等範疇。為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強了其市場外展活動，向海外及內地的持份者介紹香港金融市場的機會及其韌性，以確保他們充分了解相關資訊。\n\n金管局「金融科技2025」策略各方面均取得顯著進展，包括推廣金融科技應用、央行數碼貨幣、數據基建、人才發展，以及政策和資金支持。\n\n轉數快系統 (FPS) 於九月慶祝五周年。註冊人數穩定增長，截至2023年底已達1360萬。全年平均每日交易量增至125萬筆即時交易。轉數快 x PromptPay 連結於十二月與泰國中央銀行聯合推出，為兩地往來人士提供快速、安全且易於使用的跨境二維碼支付互聯零售支付服務。\n\n作為多個國際和區域中央銀行及監管論壇的積極參與者，金管局持續為維護金融穩定和促進金融市場發展貢獻力量。\n\n# 概述\n\nThroughout the year, 金管局 continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an 國際金融中心. In November, it organised the 國際金融領袖投資峰會 for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent 金融機構 leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “駕馭複雜的環境”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, 金管局 and the 國際結算銀行 (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former 央行行長. The conference highlighted the 金管局’s close collaboration with the 國際結算銀行 as well as with the 中央銀行界.\n\n內地與香港互聯互通計劃的擴展及優化，強化了香港作為內地與國際金融市場之間的橋樑作用。一系列跨境理財通（跨境理財通）計劃的優化措施被引入，以促進粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的跨境零售投資。 憑藉南向債券通的順利運作，金管局指定了九名額外的做市商，以改善二級市場流動性並滿足投資者需求。北向互換通亦於本年度成功推出，使全球投資者能夠通過香港更好地管理其內地固定收益投資組合的利率風險。\n\n香港離岸人民幣業務在年內見到穩健增長。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）合作，於六月推出港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台莊家機制。 這有助於在香港發展更多元化的人民幣計價產品，透過促進在香港發行及交易人民幣計價股票來實現。\n\n金管局繼續致力加強香港金融平台的競爭力。 尤其為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更寬鬆的稅務及監管環境。 在推動香港債券市場創新和鞏固香港作為區域綠色和可持續金融樞紐方面也取得了顯著進展。 同時，金管局加大了市場推廣活動，向海外及內地的持份者宣傳香港的金融服務。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室（金融科技促進辦公室）及金管局（金管局）的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以促進金融科技（金融科技）的廣泛應用，並鞏固香港在亞洲作為金融科技樞紐的地位。 年內已實施的主要舉措包括：\n- 繼續推廣財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能和分布式賬本技術（DLT）等重點科技領域的應用；\n- 推進批發央行數碼貨幣（央行數碼貨幣）的工作，以改善跨境支付（跨境支付）；\n- 繼續研究在香港引入零售央行數碼貨幣（零售層面央行數碼貨幣），即數碼港元（數碼港元）；\n- 加快發展商業數據通（商業數據通）；\n- 加強人才發展；\n- 通過資金和政策扶持金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技的跨境合作；及\n- 擴大轉數快（轉數快）的應用。\n\n香港的金融基建安全高效的運作，對維持本港作為國際金融中心 的地位至關重要。 2023年，四個銀行間實時付款結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位的服務及香港交易資料儲存庫（HKTR）均達致100%系統可用率，超出原定目標99.95%。 債務證券結算服務，包括 northbound 及 southbound 債券通的聯動服務，持續順利運作。\n\n二零二三年，轉數快的使用量持續增加，標誌著轉數快慶祝五周年這一重要里程碑。過去五年，轉數快註冊數量及交易總額均穩步增長，截至二零二三年底，註冊數量已增至一千三百六十萬，全年平均每日交易總額較二零二二年上升百分之三十三。政府賬單繳付、零售商戶支付以及為儲值支付工具（SVF）電子錢包或銀行戶口充值等轉數快的應用增加，是交易量持續上升的主要驅動力，加上人手對人及商戶之間的支付穩步增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局監察六個指定的零售支付系統，並根據支付條例，對十七個持牌銀行發出的儲值支付工具營運商（其中四個由持牌銀行發出）進行監察。 期間，金管局亦繼續促成消費券計劃的順利推行，協助協調相關政府部門及獲委任為計劃的儲值支付工具持牌人，並促進他們之間的對話及合作。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局於十二月二十七日聯合發布一份公眾諮詢文件，就穩定幣發行人的監管事宜展開諮詢。金管局其後於二零二四年三月十二日推出沙盒安排，以供計劃在香港發行與法定貨幣掛鉤的穩定幣的機構使用。與此同時，金管局一直積極參與國際組織就加密資產活動的工作，並密切監察市場的發展。\n\n國際上，金管局一直是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域性和國際委員會中持續發揮領導作用。目前，金管局同時擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策及標準小組以及亞洲區域諮詢小組的共同主席，同時亦為非銀行監察專家小組（至六月）和金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡的主席。金管局還主持國際結算銀行（BIS）的主要新興市場經濟體（EMEs）行長會議。在2018年至2023年間，金管局連續擔任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組的主席。\n\n金管局亦分別於五月和七月與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行舉行了雙邊會晤，以促進中東與亞洲的金融市場互聯互通。香港與瑞士金融合作對話第六屆於九月二十五日喺瑞士伯恩舉行，討論內容涵蓋區域及本地前景、政策挑戰、最新發展，以及喺可持續金融、金融科技及市場互聯互通領域嘅潛在合作。\n\n# 金管局於2023年為強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力所推出的舉措一覽。\n\n# 加強與世界的聯繫\n\n舉辦一系列國際活動：國際金融領袖投資峰會、金管局–國際結算銀行高級別會議及金管局–國際結算銀行聯合會議，以及巴塞爾委員會會議。\n積極參與國際中央銀行及監管論壇。\n加強與海外及內地持份者的市場聯繫，以推廣香港的金融服務，並為與中東的合作奠定了堅實的基礎。\n\n# 提升金融平台競爭力\n\n- 推動債券市場創新，協助政府發行全球首個代幣化政府綠色債券。\n- 支持深圳市和海南省政府在香港發行點心債。\n- 與國家發展和改革委員會簽訂諒解備忘錄（MoU），以支持中國企業在香港的跨境融資。\n- 加強家族辦公室和資產及財富管理行業的稅務優惠制度。\n- 繼續提升香港作為企業財資中心（CTC）樞紐和基建投資融資中心的價值。\n- 繼續發展香港的財資市場和場外衍生工具市場。\n- 鞏固香港作為區域綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位。\n\n# 確保香港關鍵金融基建的可靠性和效率。\n\n持續確保 實時付款結算系統的 安全及有效運作，以及 HKTR。\n並已推進 CMU 運營能力及產品的升級，將系統發展成為重要的國際中央證券存儲機構。\n\n# 培養未來的金融領袖，並強化經濟研究能力。\n\n延續了金融學院（AoF）的領導力發展和經濟研究工作。\n\n# 加強香港與內地金融市場的聯繫，並提升香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的地位。\n\n- 北向互換通成功啟動\n- 跨境理財通進一步完善\n- 指定更多做市商參與債券通「南向通」\n- 港元-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台莊家機制推出\n- 支持大灣區企業的業務運營和居民生活方面取得良好進展，例如為大灣區企業加強跨境資金流管理，以及為香港居民在大灣區內地城市購買物業提供便利措施\n- 內地機構與香港金融業加強交流，以尋找商機\n\n# 鞏固香港在亞洲的金融科技樞紐地位。\n\n- 繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略：\n    - 宣布一項新的金融科技推廣計劃，以發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及 DLT，於銀行體系中。\n    - 多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡 (mBridge) 項目邁向最簡可行產品開發階段。\n    - 數碼港元先導計劃第一階段已完成，涵蓋 14 項潛在應用案例。\n    - 繼續擴大香港跨境數字人民幣 (數字人民幣) 試點範圍。\n    - 已成功建立商業數據通與政府的授權數據交換閘之間的連結，以促進政府部門與金融機構之間的授權數據共享。\n- 啟動香港與泰國之間的「轉數快」及 PromptPay 連結，提供安全且易於使用的跨境零售支付服務。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

儲備管理\n\n二零二三年，投資環境波動且充滿挑戰。儘管年初一些美國和歐洲的銀行出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。雖然主要發達經濟體中的通膨水平已從二零二三年的峰值回落，但仍高於各主要央行設定的目標。在激烈的加息周期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季度起已暫停加息，並表示利率可能已達到或接近峰值。 加上美國經濟的韌性，使得投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄羅斯與烏克蘭的戰爭以及年中中東的衝突爆發，為投資市場增加了動盪和不確定性。 在這複雜且動態的投資環境中，外匯基金的表現經歷了一些起伏。儘管如此，外匯基金仍成功實現了可觀的投資回報。二零二三年，外匯基金錄得投資收入為二千二百六十億港元，相當於 5.5% 的投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n外匯基金的主要目標，按照《外匯基金條例》規定，是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。該基金也可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性和完整性，以協助維護香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司司長的授權下，並在授權範圍內，對外匯基金的使用和投資管理負責財政司司長。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會 (EFAC) 已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 維護本金；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎隨時均由高流動性的美元資產完全備抵；\n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣與金融穩定；及\n(iv) 於(i)-(iii)的前提下，達致有助於維護外匯基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標完全顧及了外匯基金的法定目的，並納入基金的組合架構和目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖一 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n廣泛來說，外匯基金擁有兩個主要的投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持組合（BP）持有高流動性的美元計息資產，以完全支持貨幣基礎，這是在貨幣發行局制度下要求的。投資組合（IP）主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，旨在維護其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局會以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金的一部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。 這些包括新興巿場及內地債券及股票、私募股權（包括基建）以及房地產。 新興巿場及內地的債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。 長期增長組合（LTGP）的目標資產配置將與其他資產類別同時確定，並遵守審慎的風險管理及資產組合多元化策略。\n\n策略性資產組合，於2007年設立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金的策略目的而收購的。 由於其獨特性，策略性資產組合不包含在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金，不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款。利率通常與投資組合的表現掛鉤。一個主要例外是未來基金，其利率與投資組合和長期增長組合的回報，根據組合比重而定。未來基金在2023年投資組合和長期增長組合的組合比重約為35:65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表外匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰略性偏離的方式進行配置，以期實現超越投資基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置通常與投資基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與投資基準之間的差異被稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然投資基準和追蹤誤差限制由財政司司長在與外匯基金諮詢委員會商議後決定，但戰略性決策和戰略性偏離的可接受範圍由金管局根據授權 полномо權作出並設定。在戰略性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取 позиции 以利用短期的市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局外匯基金投資辦公室負責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的支持組合及部分投資組合。內部管理的投資組合部分包括一系列投資於環球定息市場，並實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局聘用外聘投資經理管理約 29% 的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。聘用外聘經理的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，同時借鑒多元且互補的投資風格，並利用外部市場洞察力和投資方面的專業技術。\n\n與外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費及預扣稅及其他稅項。此項支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境日益複雜，良好的風險管理變得越來越重要。金管局為其內部及外部管理的投資組合都制定嚴格的監控和投資指引，並確保已建立完善的風險監察及合規制度。三重防線已到位，以實施有效的風險管理和投資相關活動的治理。關鍵風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及業務操作風險）會定期進行監察。風險管理流程提供了一個穩健的框架，支持金管局的策略制定和投資多元化努力。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信，適當強調負責任投資及可持續長期表現，有助更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，同時降低其投資標的相關環境、社會及管治（ESG）事宜帶來的風險。為推廣負責任投資的做法，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資流程，其指導原則是，一般會優先考慮ESG投資，前提是其經風險調整長期收益與其他投資相若。更多關於金管局負責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱二零二三年可持續發展報告的「負責任投資」一章。\n\n#

金融市場在2023年\n\n二零二三年的投資環境波動且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年大致呈現上升趨勢。標普500指數在當年上漲了24%，尤其是在第四季，市場開始預期比預期更早的降息。\n\n在債市，收益率維持高位，美國10年期國債收益率一度衝上5%以上，創下2007年以來最高水平。然而，隨著市場對全球主要央行的貨幣政策預期轉變，在債券價格逐漸上漲的同時，債券收益率在年末回落。\n\n在貨幣市場，美元兌主要貨幣表現參差不齊。其中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日元和人民幣則貶值。\n\n表1顯示了2023年主要貨幣、債市及股市的表現。\n\n表1

另外，策略性資產組合錄得估值虧損4.8億港元。\n\n外匯基金的資產總值在年末達到 4,0165 億港元。LTGP 下的投資總市值為 5173 億港元，其中私募股權為 4119 億港元，房地產為 1054 億港元。LTGP 的已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為 2911 億港元。\n\n外匯基金 2023 年的投資回報，不包括策略性資產組合，為 5.5%。投資組合和支持組合的年率化內部回報率分別為 6.4% 和 5.0%。長期增長組合自 2009 年成立以來，已錄得年率化內部回報率 11.8%。\n\n圖一列出了1994年至2023年外匯基金的年度回報。表二顯示了2023年的投資回報以及基金在不同年期內的平均投資回報。2021–2023年間的平均回報為1.6%，2019–2023年間為3.3%，2014–2023年間為2.7%，自1994年以來為4.5%。表三顯示了基金資產於2023年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n請參閱第205至311頁，以了解外匯基金的已審核2023年財務報表。\n\n圖一

The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart

機構職能\n\n機構職能支持金管局的運作，並以高度的透明度、問責性、效率和專業性為之。為促進公眾對其政策和運作的理解，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、金管局網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，積極與社會和市場參與者溝通。\n\n內部，金管局正努力構建靈活的專業團隊，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升其數碼能力，以適應變化並確保其政策和倡議得到有效實施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係及社交媒體的使用\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度，並促進公眾對其政策及營運的理解。 2023年，金管局舉行或參與了188項傳媒活動，包括11場新聞發佈會、六場媒體簡報、15場即席訪談及156項其他公開活動。 此外，在年內，金管局還安排了另外25場媒體訪談，發佈了583篇雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高對金管局主要職能的認識，我們為本地、內地及外地傳媒舉辦了新聞發佈會和媒體簡報。討論的主題包括反詐騙舉措、央行數碼貨幣（央行數碼貨幣）及穩定幣。\n\n傳媒代表於2023年積極參與金管局舉辦的活動，尤其以第二次國際金融領袖投資峰會為例。為期三天的活動在本地、內地及國際媒體中產生了超過2,000篇正面且客觀的新聞報道。\n\n余偉文行政長官在香港金融科技周2023的即場訪問上發表演講。\n\n余偉文行政長官於國際金融領袖投資峰會上進行即場訪問。\n\n袁志明先生（右起第一位），執行副總裁，主持一場在保障消費者防詐騙約章活動中的分享會。\n\n李

公眾查詢\n\n金管局的公眾查詢服務提供了一個有效的途徑，讓公眾更深入地了解金管局的主要職能和運作。\n\n在2023年，公眾查詢服務處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約一半與消費者銀行事務、銀行政策及法規、金融基建與債券市場發展，以及硬幣與紙幣有關。部分常見的查詢主題包括銀行產品及服務、硬幣收集計劃、零售債券發行計劃、銀行相關指引與通告，以及轉數快。\n\n圖表一顯示自2020年以來，公眾查詢服務收到的查詢數量，而圖表二則提供了2023年查詢性質的詳細說明。\n\n圖一 公共諮詢總數\n\n圖表 2 2023 年收到的諮詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n在過去的一年，金管局已發布其二零二二年年報，以及首份獨立的可持續發展報告。二零二二年年報在香港管理專業協會二零二三年最佳年報評選中，於「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中獲得金獎，為該類別中的最高排名。同時，二零二二年可持續發展報告贏得了香港會計師公會二零二三年最佳企業管治及ESG大獎的ESG獎，並在「公眾╱非牟利機構（大型）」類別中獲獎。\n\n金管局於2023年發布了兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》及四期《季報》，並定期更新《金融數據月報》，以提供及時和主題性的香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的資料及分析。金管局同時亦發布了14期《inSight1》文章，介紹主要的新規劃及倡議，並探討時事議題。\n\n# 機構網站\n\n機構網站 (www.hkma.gov.hk)，內容包含近六萬頁，提供英文、繁體及簡體中文的最新金管局 (HKMA) 資訊。 網站載有認可機構紀錄冊、本地代表辦事處及認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊，兩者均根據銀行業條例 (BO) 第20條維護，以及儲值支付工具條例下的儲值支付工具持牌人紀錄冊。\n\n金管局自2018年起，已分階段透過應用程式介面（開放API）在其網站上發布金融數據及重要資訊。截至2023年底，金管局在其網站上已開放了175組開放API，符合其目標時間表。\n\n金管局的開放API門戶網站：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於國際金融中心2期55樓的金管局資訊中心，設有展覽區及圖書館，旨在向社會大眾介紹金管局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。互動式展覽區介紹了金管局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展，並提供有助於研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資訊及展品。\n\n在一年內，資訊中心接待了超過三萬一千多位訪客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦了超過四百八十場導覽行程。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽區，收錄超過兩萬六千本關於香港貨幣、銀行業及金融事務以及中央銀行議題的書籍、期刊和其他出版物。它還根據《銀行業條例》第20條的要求，向公眾開放《認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊》及《本地代表辦事處》的紀錄，並維護《認可機構》的紀錄。\n\n年幼的遊客們在資訊中心的導覽遊覽中，學習香港鈔票的設計。\n\n為幼兒園學生導覽資訊中心。\n\n# 社區參與及公眾教育宣傳\n\n自一九九八年以來，金管局一直舉辦公眾教育講座，向社會宣傳其工作，提高公眾意識。 至今，已有超過六萬六千人參與公眾教育講座。 於二零二三年，為超過一千二百名來自五十八間中學的學生和教師舉辦一場網上講座。 網上講座的主題包括金管局的工作概述、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、數碼KEY的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融以及銀行業的職業機會。\n\n金管局致力教育市民，成為精明和負責任的金融消費者。 鑒於網絡釣魚及信用卡欺詐個案增加，金管局繼續透過不同媒體提醒公眾保持警惕。 在保障消費者防詐騙約章推出後，金管局推出全新宣傳活動，強調銀行及主要商戶承諾不會透過即時電子訊息發送連結，索取個人及信用卡資料。 金管局亦透過電台及社交媒體專頁，傳播信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同付款選項（包括「先買後付」產品）的貼士。\n\n一部新的影片和動畫以「保護您的數碼KEY；小心可疑連結！」為主題，內容呈現食人花和捕獸器。\n\n跨媒體宣傳活動旨在提醒公眾不要點擊可疑連結。\n\n製作宣傳電子利是的動畫影片。\n\n為支持環保，並借鑒金融服務領域的科技進步，金管局鼓勵市民透過社交媒體和電台宣傳，於農曆新年期間發放電子利是（電子利是）及考慮使用迎新鈔作為實體利是。\n\n金管局亦致力加強公眾對金融業的理解，並提高年輕人對在金融業發展事業的興趣，從而擴大香港的金融業人才庫。 繼早前錄製的「中環4型人格」影片系列獲得好評後，金管局推出全新影片系列，名為「金融特工隊：新領域全開」，介紹金融業的四個增長領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色和可持續金融以及財富管理。 該影片系列利用電腦圖像和動畫，展示經驗豐富的從業員指導年輕人才應對日常工作挑戰，並以輕鬆的方式介紹行業內的工作機會和前景。\n\n為讓年輕世代掌握金融領域的職涯機會，製作了一系列影片，名為「金融特工隊：新領域全開」。\n\n各領域的導師分享他們的專業知識和經驗給學生。\n\n為提升中學生理財知識，金管局與其他持份者合作，連續第九年舉辦「全港理財爭霸戰」。是次以「數碼及可持續經濟」為主題，有助學生進一步了解金錢管理、環保及可持續發展、金融市場現況以及職業機會。活動內容亦包括一場收到約兩萬份投稿的網上問答遊戲、來自不同領域的資深從業者的師友交流，以及設計思維挑戰賽。\n\n# 智慧理財321\n\n金管局推出了其第一個理財教育桌上遊戲，名為「$mart Money Management 321」，與一間專注於桌上遊戲製作的社會企業共同設計和開發。這款桌上遊戲旨在幫助小學學生學習不同的付款方式、金錢管理概念、金融科技和網絡安全，並在模擬情景中進行體驗。\n\n金管局於2023年香港書展設攤位，推廣桌上遊戲，該遊戲是書展中最暢銷的商品之一。此外，金管局還組織了一系列免費宣傳活動，包括社區中心的研討會、小學生的試玩活動，以及為小學教師和非政府組織的社工舉辦的培訓員工作坊。同時，在節慶季節於元創方設立了「$mart

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee

意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）第211頁至311頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括外匯基金及集團截至2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重大會計政策資料。\n\n在我意見中，該財務報表真實而中肯地反映了外匯基金及集團截至2023年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至當時止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則 (“HKFRSs”) 擬備，且符合根據《外匯基金條例》(第66章)第7節發出的首長行政長的指示。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我謹遵照《外匯基金條例》第七條賦予首席行政長官的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據該準則，我的職責在我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節中有更詳細的說明。我符合該準則對 集團 的獨立性要求，並且已按照該準則履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指，在我專業判斷下，於截至2023年12月31日止年度對財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項。 這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審計的背景下處理的，並且在形成我對其意見的過程中，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員對其他資訊負有責任。該其他資訊包括香港金融管理專員2023年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表以及我對該報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表之意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且對此類資訊不表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，評估該等其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯著失實。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我必須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責編製財務報表，真實而中肯地反映，並按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的行政長官指示進行編製，同時負責金融管理專員認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監察集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以判斷財務報表整體是否因欺詐或錯誤而存在重大錯報，並發布一份包含我的意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高度的保證，但並非保證在按照審計署的審計準則進行的審計中，一定能發現存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於欺詐或錯誤，並且如果個別或總體上可能合理預期會影響基於這些財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為遵循審計署的審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行與該等風險相應的審計程序，並取得充足且適當的審計憑證，以作為我意見的依據。因欺詐所導致未發現重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所導致的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽不實或凌駕內部控制。\n取得對內部控制的理解，以設計在情況下適當的審計程序，但非為表達對集團內部控制成效的意見之目的；\n評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性，以及金融管理專員所做的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n對金融管理專員採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性做出結論，並根據取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我須在我的審計報告中對相關的財務報表披露事項加以提示，或若此等披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論乃基於截至我的審計報告日所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了相關交易和事件；以及\n取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充足適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表表達意見。我對群體審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通，內容包括審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現，其中包括我在審計過程中識別到的任何內部監控制度中的重大缺失。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的道德要求，並向他們溝通所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及適用的相關保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定了在審計本期財務報表時最具重要性的事項，這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為將某事項不予在報告中溝通，因為這樣做可能產生的不利後果合理預期將會超過公開溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n林志遠教授\n審計署署長\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員，獲財政司司長作為外匯基金監管員授權，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理外匯基金（該基金）。該基金的主要業務是維護香港貨幣的匯率價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性和完整性。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合和策略性資產組合。支持組合的資產完全符合貨幣基礎，在香港的發行銀行制下運作。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（經濟合作與發展組織）成員國的債市及股市。長期增長組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為基金的策略目的而收購的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。營運部門資訊請參閱第31條注釋。\n\n# 2 存貨核算政策\n\n# 符合聲明\n\n這些財務報表已按照香港財務報告準則 (HKFRSs) 編製，而香港會計師公會 (HKICPA) 發布的香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋，以及香港公認的會計原則，均被此術語涵蓋。 本基金及其附屬公司（統稱為集團）採納的重大會計政策如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的或修改後的香港財務報告準則，於本集團的本會計期間首次生效或可提前採用。附註3提供有關因首次應用這些發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有）的資訊，以適用的範圍說明其與本集團本會計期間及財務報表所列前會計期間的相關性。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表之編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司及合營公司權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務在第16段和第17段附註中列出。\n\n財務報表編製所使用的會計基礎為歷史成本，但以下資產及負債除外，它們以公平值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（註 2.6）；\n- 以收支帳目衡量之金融資產及金融負債（註 2.6）；\n- 以其他全面收益衡量之金融資產（註 2.6）；\n- 黃金（註 2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（註 2.11）。\n\n遵照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告數字。 這些估計及相關假設乃基於過往經驗及其他被認為在當時情況下合理的事項，其結果構成了作出關於資產及負債賬面值的判斷的依據，而這些賬面值並非可從其他途徑明顯得知。 實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續檢討。 若估計調整僅影響當期，則會於估計調整期認列；若調整同時影響當期及未來期間，則會於調整期及未來期間認列。\n\n管理層在應用香港財務報告準則時作出的對財務報表有重要影響，且主要來源於估計不確定性的判斷，已在附註2.18中披露。\n\n某些比較數字已重新編列，以符合集團財務報表的最新呈列方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。當集團能從其與該實體的參與中獲得可變動回報，並且具備透過其對該實體的控制權來影響這些回報的能力時，即對該實體實施控制。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。\n"}
