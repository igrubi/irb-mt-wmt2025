{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對逆境的韌性。\n\n在...情況下全球經濟成長放緩，且利率將維持高位，地緣政治緊張亦加劇——不僅源於俄烏衝突和中國-美國緊張關係，也包括中東地區的衝突爆發——是二零二三年度金融市場的關鍵主題。三月美國和歐洲的銀行風波，自二零零八年全球金融危機以來，對市場情緒造成了更大的壓力。主要經濟體正應對收緊貨幣政策和對通貨膨脹路徑及利率預期更大的不確定性。而中國大陸經濟復甦的步伐，比普遍預期要較長時間，更增加了不確定性。\n\n隨著金融市場出現波動和難以預測，香港再次證明了其知名適應能力，展現出卓越的具韌性。自城市全面疫情後重新開放以來，去年已進行了大量工作，以吸引人民回復到我們這個多變的城市，並與香港重新連繫。香港金管局通過舉辦一連串大型國際活動，例如全球金融領導人投資峰會以及與國際銀行間銀行（BIS）的會議，貢獻了力量，展示了我們充滿活力的城市，並幫助向全世界傳達信息，即香港作為主要的國際金融中心（IFC），對商業開放，繼續是行動和創新的中心。有跡象顯示，受到鼓勵的入境旅遊業復甦和改善的私人消費所推動，正在逐步回復。同時，具韌性的勞動市場以及政府推出的多項支持措施也提供了支持。就全年而言，香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的負面領域回復到3.2%。\n\n香港金管局於2023年進入第四十年。過去30年見證了經濟和金融市場的劇烈變化，科技推動了超出任何人想像的推進。過去三十年所獲得的寶貴經驗和智慧，使我們能夠以信心面對未來。儘管面臨宏觀經濟逆風和不確定的外部環境，香港金管局將繼續維護其保護貨幣和銀行穩定的職責，並積極推動發展機會，以鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地​​地位。\n\n前任及現任財政司司長及香港特別行政區金管局首長於一聚會，慶祝金管局三十週年：（從左）嚴嘉良先生、唐英年先生、曾德成先生、陳茂波先生、余權偉先生、梁錦祥先生、曾俊承先生及陳德霖先生。\n\n# LERS — 經受風暴的考驗\n\n去年標誌著聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的40周年。這項制度是支持香港雄厚且穩健貨幣和金融系統的堅實支柱。4項十年運作，已培養了市場對LERS的信心及可信性。貫穿全年，港幣均在匯率轉兑範圍內，港幣市場運作暢順，反映了市場對LERS的強信心，這份信心亦由國際貨幣基金組織及全球參與者分享並表示。\n\n背後有香港金管局在公眾和市場活動中積極的努力，以及有效的監察。 過去一年，我們沒有遺漏任何工作，與關鍵持份者溝通，以促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，尤其是在波動時期，無論是源於經濟壓力還是政治不明朗因素。 我們亦加強了對貨幣系統的監察，藉使用來自交易數據庫的數據集，以及從銀行擴展的詳細數據，連同先進的數據分析和人工智能，以提升我們的能力，讓金融穩定和宏觀審慎監察的分析更加及時和全面。\n\n# 銀行系統——主要的資料來源，是穩定的大宗。\n\n儘管面臨諸多充滿挑戰，包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張，以及充滿挑戰的信貸環境，香港的銀行體系貫穿全年都維持穩健，雄厚且充足的資本和流動性支持了這一切。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行綜合總資本充足率維持於21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求8%。大型銀行的流動性覆蓋率於2023年第四季微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求100%。雖然不良貸款比率從2022年底的1.40%上升至1.56%，維持於2023年底，但仍低於2.0%的長期歷史平均水平。這項增加主要推動來自對中國內地私營企業（POE）房地產開發商的風險敞口；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信用風險管理，此類風險敞口水平更廣泛層面得以綜合控制，而銀行業的整體資產品質維持健康。\n\n二零二三年最讓市場參與者感到意外的，毫無疑問是美國的銀行動盪蔓延至歐洲，造成自二零零八年全球金融危機以來前所未見的系統性銀行壓力。香港金管局自此維持高度警惕，並在情況發展過程中接任一系列預防性行動，以限額潛在的負面溢出效應，避免對本地銀行和金融系統的信心造成影響。這，以及香港銀行雄厚的首府和流動性緩衝維持，意味著我們的銀行業在很大程度上未受動盪影響，即使全球金融市場動盪，也具韌性。在這起事件之後，香港金管局進行了一項全面的內部審查，旨在汲取本地銀行業的經驗，並加強香港金管局的監管效能和敏捷性，以處理可能發生的銀行危機。\n\n儘管審慎的信貸風險管理很重要，我們一直重申對銀行保持對支持實體經濟需要的預期。隨著銀行業預先核准本金償還寬限計劃於2023年7月開始有序退出，且新冠疫情的經濟影響減退，金管局與銀行緊密合作，以確保貸款償還向常態化轉變的逐步暢順過程，並為持續承受壓力的借款人提供彈性。今年較早時候，鑑於部分中小企業在疫情結束後仍然面對營運挑戰，推出9項新措施，以進一步協助它們從銀行取得融資。\n\n檢討了與本地物業市場相關的銀行物業貸款風險後，金管局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來，首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此放寬提高了大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展和投資融資的貸款成數上限。其後，於2024年初跟隨其後，暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n金管局對金融機構的監管與時並進。近期多年來，全球欺詐個案急劇增加，我們已相當地加強努力，以 противодействовать 新的欺詐手段，推出一套全面的措施，保障銀行客戶。這些包括加強銀行之間以及與執法機構之間的信息分享；加強對可疑交易的監測（包括執行實時欺詐監測以及收緊支付卡驗證）；授權客戶對其支付卡擁有更多控制權；以及透過推出反詐騙消費者保護憲章，以及推出交易前警示機制，向用戶發出警告，如果發現有較高風險的快速支付系統 (FPS) 交易，便會識別到。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的快速增長，香港金管局與銀行業合作，加強消費者及投資者保護，更廣泛地提升銀行業的營運及網絡安全韌性，以及它們應對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦。與此同時，所有主要銀行已顯著加強了應對及復甦具破壞性的惡意軟件攻擊的能力。香港金管局與業界亦合作推行不同消費者數據基礎設施項目，例如「信貸數據智能」試驗計劃，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並且推動一項跨境信貸參考倡議，便利企業的跨境融資活動，以及。\n\n金融科技與數位化可以在風險妥善管理的前提下帶來巨大的機會。藉著先前在促進監管科技（Regtech）應用方面的成功，香港金融管理局在8月2023年，得到證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局的支持，載有新的金融科技推動發展路線圖，以推動金融機構在五個重點範疇——財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能和分布式分類帳技術方面進一步發展。我們預期本地監管機構將繼續合作，與各行業緊密工作，以便香港金融業全年保持緊貼並把握多變的金融科技發展帶來的好處。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心——行動與創新的中心\n\n在2023年，我們充分地從疫情中回復。香港不僅恢復了商業活動，而且其作為世界領先的國際金融中心 的地位，更因全球投資者的回歸和我們加強的全球網絡而得到進一步強調。 國內方面，我們把握了香港金管局三十週年成立的機遇，主辦了一連串大型國際性活動，邀請了來自全球金融和銀行界的 高級別參與者，以 демонстрировать 香港的活力，並傳達一個明確的信息，即香港作為國際金融中心仍然與全球投資者和力求增長和創新的金融機構 相關且不可或缺。 尤其值得注意的是，全球金融領袖投資峰會已恢復舉辦，於11月在香港舉行，吸引了來自約160家全球金融機構的350多位國際和地區領導人。 在香港舉辦的其他高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的會議以及兩場金管局-BIS會議，這些聚會是當年中央銀行行長和銀行監管人員中規模最大的。 這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。\n\n對外，2023年亦是香港積極力求加強與傳統市場，包括美國及歐洲，以及新目的地，例如中東地區的聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的同儕監管機構和全球金融機構高層管理層達成會晤，既介紹了香港和內地的機會，也力求為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n鑑於這些聯繫努力，我們亦積極貢獻於國際和區域組織的工作。在該年，我接受邀請擔任主要新興市場經濟體中央銀行行長會議的主席，以及聯席主席金融穩定理事會（FSB）的亞洲地區諮詢小組。我的同事們亦正在擔任或聯席主席巴塞爾委員會、金融行動工作組和東亞太平洋地區中央銀行行長會議等多間其他重要小組。香港金管局在多間區域和國際組織中的領導角色，是對香港在國際中央銀行和監管工作方面的專門知識和貢獻的認可，以及對香港作為國際金融中心的重要性。\n\n為建立上述成就，我們必須將自身定位為一家長遠的IFC，走在前瞻的地位，以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來幾年將影響我們未來的三個長期趨勢，即：中國大陸的持續開放、綠色和可持續金融的發展以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持我們金融市場的發展，以捕捉這些長期趨勢的機會，同時將我們的金融平台定位為提供領先服務，吸引更多業務到香港。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面工作的詳情，讀者可參考我們的2023年可持續發展報告。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年工作重點及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和的步伐繼續復甦，得益於入境旅遊業的持續復甦、公共基礎設施項目以及穩健的私營消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不明朗因素，加上與未來美國政策利率走勢、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張相關的因素。 儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來積累的充裕緩衝，繼續具備抵禦不利震盪的能力。\n\n金管局十分重視保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望前瞻，我們將在不確定的宏觀經濟環境中保持警惕，力求迅速識別新興風險並應對它們，以靈活應變的方式。 同時，我們將尋求機會，並創造政策空間，以協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。 在管理投資基金於此充滿挑戰的投資環境中，我們將繼續謹慎投資，同時保持靈活，適當採取防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的健全與穩定\n\n近期全球經濟不明朗因素持續多年，預計將在2024年繼續。香港金管局將緊貼最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，目標是維護金融體系的韌性和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，對潛在風險保持警惕。\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景不明朗因素、不斷演變的地緣政治風險以及不均衡的全球經濟復甦而經歷震盪。2024年亦是關鍵選舉年，多間主要選舉定於世界各地舉行。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場不明朗因素。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來累計的緩衝，能夠承受不利的震盪。香港金管局也具備能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續其努力，緊密監察本地及外部環境中出現的任何風險及漏洞，並在必要時部署適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦將進行研究，探討影響香港經濟的議題，評估及應對與此相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n在2023年，新的地緣政治緊張局勢跨越世界各地爆發，而其他問題則維持未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定，情況預期將持續至2024年。高利率形式的經濟壓力是全球景觀的一個特徵，進入2024年，利率維持高位。在銀行業內，持續朝數位化的發展以及新技術的執行，包括人工智能，帶來了多間優勢，但也帶來了新的運營和網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。鑑於如此動盪的政治、經濟和技術環境，香港金管局致力於確保銀行承受震盪的能力，透過其持續的監管努力。與此同時，我們將繼續提升和完善我們的銀行監管和法規框架及政策，以考慮技術發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 風險為本的重點監管。\n\n# 信貸、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金管局的重點將會是監察持牌金融機構（AIs）的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及監控的成效，尤其在貸款分類、備抵呆帳措施及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行和商業行業維持緊密對話，以確保持牌金融機構在審慎的信貸風險管理和履行經濟週期內的金融中介功能之間取得適當的平衡。尤其，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟隨9項於2024年3月推出的新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景不明朗因素以及地緣政治緊張可能增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金管局將優先取得警惕，並繼續更有效地監管AI的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 針對從2023年銀行動盪中汲取的經驗，所採取的行動跟進\n\n金管局將推行內部審查中識別的跟進行動，以應對美國和歐洲2023年的銀行動盪。這些行動將進一步加強監管成效，提升其處理銀行危機的能力，若出現此類情況。它們包括在金管局的監管審查過程中，加強AI對銀行賬本中利率風險的捕捉；鑒於銀行服務的持續數字化，提升AI應對流動性壓力的準備；簡化金管局的危機管理流程；以及進一步加強跨機構和跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監察人工智能產品（AI）朝全面合規於《金管局監察指引手册》（SPM）OR-2模組「營運穩健」的進展，並評估及基準銀行對可信干擾的容忍限額，以提升整體銀行體系的穩健性。 關於網絡風險，我們將監察人工智能產品進行一輪根據《網絡穩健評估框架2.0》的自我評估，並監察人工智能產品對安全級聯備份的執行，以加強其在面對具破壞性的網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑒於銀行營運數字化轉型的步伐持續加快，香港金管局將密切關注源自使用先進科技（例如生成式人工智能和分布式分類帳）而衍生的新風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，建立一個靈活應變且預防性的機制，以應對日益增長的網絡詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資\n\n在2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全，並建立客戶信心，金管局將應對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持對政治敏感人物要求變動的有效、風險為本的執行，以及支持對穩定幣發行人的監管制度的執行。我們亦將發行指引以協助人工智能優化其交易監察系統，並推動人工智慧的負責任使用，重點關注針對高端洗錢的控制，透過我們的專題工作。為加強對數字欺詐的回應，並減低受害者損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾和業界，就將銀行間信息共享範圍從企業帳戶擴大至個人帳戶的建議案進行討論，並基於收到回覆，推動必要的立法修訂。我們將全面建立宏觀分析3.0，透過匯集來自多個銀行的與洗錢反恐相關的數據，並將其與現有生態系統欺詐分析進行接駁。這將帶來更迅速的跨銀行回應，並進一步提升我們基於數據的反洗錢和打擊恐怖融資監管，讓我們能夠採取更迅速、更果斷的行動，應對系統性洗錢和恐怖融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關的業務\n\n2024年，香港金管局將加強對人工智能在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險以及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的進行，無論是現場審查還是離線監察。具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境財富管理通路的業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，鑑於最新的市場發展以及不斷演變的國際標準。\n\n金管局將緊密溝通以及其他監管機構和銀行業，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售，提供適當的指引，就監管標準方面制定規定。尤其，為了支持虛擬資產行業的可持續和負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府和其他監管機構合作，確保為虛擬資產行業所制定的監管制度強勁、全面且平衡。\n\n金管局將便利及監察業界對跨境智匯合署的提升工作，並將繼續與業界及相關監管機構溝通，以便進一步提升此計劃。我們亦將繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適當整合及闡明指引，以便利業界的合規工作。此外，除了信託業務外，我們還將開始對《證券及期貨條例》下新第13類受規管活動進行監察，此活動適用於為集合投資計劃提供存管服務的人工智能，並於2024年10月2日開始運作。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n金管局旨在根據《支付系統及預付卡發出機構條例》（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的不同指引，推動其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全和效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI 執行監察及評估工作，並參與其他國際工作小組，商討新穎且創新的 FMI 相關倡議的執行。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並會適當檢討及加強我們的監管要求，以展現最新的國際慣例以及市場和科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將會繼續加強及完善其銀行監管及監察框架及政策，鑑於國際標準及最高 практики。\n\n# 香港的巴塞爾標準執行。\n\n《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR）為 實施 巴塞爾三

{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年錄得正面增長， وذلك 歸功於入境旅遊和本地需求復甦。勞工市場隨著經濟復甦持續改善，而通脹維持溫和。儘管如此，在收緊的金融環境和疲弱的市場情緒下，資產市場維持疲弱。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和的步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景蒙上陰影，受到多個不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n儘管去年面臨疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰，香港經濟在2023年穩健增長3.2%（表1和圖1）。在對內方面，私人消費主要在改善的就業市場狀況和政府推出的不同支持措施（例如消費券計劃和一連串宣傳活動）的支持下回復顯著。然而，儘管金融條件收緊，整體投資支出相較於去年低 的比較基準錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港的服務出口反彈，主要歸功於入境旅遊業的雄厚復甦。然而，其正面影響被服務貿易（衡量為服務進口）中強勁的出口旅遊業復甦所抵銷。另一方面，商品出口在疲弱的外部需求影響下維持低迷，拖累了香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖 1 實際 GDP 增長，按貢獻劃分\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n表1

勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況於2023年進一步改善，失業率降至7月份的近十年低位2.8%，其後數個月的月份則徘徊於低位 (圖3)。勞工需求和勞工供應均上升，分別反映於總就業人數的上升 (圖3) 以及勞工人口的增加。鑒於香港的人力短缺問題，政府於2023年推出不同輸入勞工計劃3和吸引人才措施4。與此同時，由於勞工市場狀況緊俏，名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長率逐步上升，朝向疫情前的水平。\n\n圖2 隱藏的消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2023年初 стабилизировавшись，本地股市在下半年轉為疲弱。延續了2022年底的反彈，恆生指數在27（1月27日）上升至全年高位的22,689點收市（圖4），其後回落，並進一步下跌至低位，反映了因美國和瑞士三月份的銀行問題，以及全球經濟前景轉弱，以及下半年的金融條件收緊所導致的疲弱市場情緒。恆生指數以17,047點收結束本年，較2022年底下跌顯著13.8%，標誌著連續第4年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首4項月份，在中國大陸和香港復常的恢復下出現反彈，但其後隨着利率上升和疲弱的市場情緒而回落。整體而言，2023年住宅價格按年下跌6.9%，而住宅交易量進一步下跌4.5%，錄得43,002個單位，創下低點。儘管房屋可負擔性略有改善，但仍然維持緊張，連同房屋價格的下調。同樣，非住宅物業市場持續面對壓力，寫字樓、零售店鋪和工廠單位價格進一步回落。由於在家工作安排的普及和大量供應，寫字樓租金持續處於壓力之下。另一方面，隨著內地旅遊業的復甦和私人物業消費的改善，零售店鋪租金在2023年上升。\n\n圖4

政府預測2024年實際GDP將增長5%–3.5%。 然而，前景蒙上陰影，存在多個不明朗因素，包括源於美國政策利率路徑、科技周期回升的步伐、全球經濟增長的前景以及不斷的地緣政治緊張。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n本地通脹預測在2024年將會維持溫和，回落的外部價格壓力將協助抵銷國內成本的向上壓力，在...情況下，並隨著持續的經濟復甦和房屋租金上升。市場共識預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預測整體和核心通脹率分別為2.4%和1.7%。另一方面，勞工市場預計將受到持續的經濟復甦支持，而各項勞工輸入和人才吸引計劃將繼續協助紓緩不同行業的人力短缺。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n在2023年，香港銀行業面對多個挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國及歐洲三月銀行動盪引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及中國內地及香港經濟復甦不如預期。儘管面對這些多個逆風，香港銀行業維持健康，並且持續得到雄厚資本和流動性儲備的支持。儘管不良貸款比率有所增加，銀行業的資產品質維持健康。銀行的盈利改善顯著，推動因素是淨利息收入較高。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率上升至2023年底的1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所增加，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦增加至1.24%，較0.85%（圖5）。與此同時，與內地相關的貸款分類貸款比率亦上升至2023年底的2.58%，較一年前的2.26%。 分類貸款比率的增加主要歸因於對內地房地產開發商的風險敞口下調（評級）。然而，銀行撥備的維持情況仍然足夠。撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款之比）維持在2023年底的75%。如果將為分類貸款所持抵押品的市場價值納入考量，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，住宅按揭貸款和信用卡貸款的不良貸款比率分別維持在2023年底的0.08%和0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5

利潤趨勢\n\n銀行業錄得顯著的利潤增長於2023年。零售銀行稅前經營利潤總額在該年上升了62.1%，而稅後平均資產收益率則從0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。利潤的改善主要結果是淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及與此同時，2023年持作交易投資的顯著收益，相比去年溫和的虧損。部分抵銷了貸款減損準備金的增加（+28%），因為為新的分類貸款撥備了特定準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息率在2023年擴大至1.68%，相比前一年1.31%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本收入比在2023年下降至38.8%，而2022年為48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定性\n\n在2023年，在市場預期“高維持”的美國政策利率情況下，港幣大部分時間在聯繫匯率範圍的疲弱一側交易，在2月中至初五期間，疲弱聯繫匯率承諾被觸發了8次。自五月起，港幣已回升了一些動力，並在年底交易於7.8的中央票價附近。在聯繫匯率制度下，該制度於2023年慶祝40周年，香港銀行同業拆息率更廣泛層面追蹤其美元有關當局，同時也受到本地供求影響。整體而言，港幣的匯款市場維持穩健，並以暢順且有秩序的方式交易。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地體現了其力量和對不同外部震盪的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩健。此處的定義是指香港幣對美元在外匯市場的匯率，維持在7.75至7.85港元兌一美元的範圍內。貨幣系統的結構採用貨幣發行制度，要求貨幣基地至少以美國圓儲備金在聯匯基金中持有的金額的100%為基礎，並且貨幣基地的變動必須與美國圓儲備金的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣總量（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，其為三家發行銀行發行的紙鈔提供全面支持；\n- 流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣；\n- 結餘總額，為與香港金管局設於的清算賬戶制衡；以及\n- 香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息。\n\n港幣匯率的穩定性乃透過自動利率調整機制以及金管局對履行可換匯協議（CUs）的雄厚承諾而維持。當強方（或弱方）CU被觸發時，金管局準備好於要求時，以每美元7.85港元（或7.75港元）向（或從）銀行沽出（或買入）美元，Aggregate Balance 將會擴大（或收縮），以推動港幣利率下降（或上升），協助港幣回復於7.75至7.85的換匯範圍內。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期美國利率將維持高位的情況下，香港 dollar 匯率在 2023 年貫穿全年大部分時間維持疲弱，主要在聯繫匯率範圍內交易。弱方單邊沽匯（CU）被觸發 8 次，時間從 2月中到初五月。香港 dollar 匯率在初五月至七月期間回升，部分原因是上市企業的派發需求以及企業年底的資金需求推動。此後，香港 dollar 主要受到本地資金需求的變化所驅動，例如透過港股通的買入流動，並在年底交易在 7.8 的中央價位約 (圖 1)。整體而言，香港 dollar 匯率市場在 2023 年持續維持正常運作。\n\n圖一 二零二三年市場匯率\n\n從二月至五月，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行要求，在弱方圓匯市場買入總額為515億港元。反映弱方圓匯市場的觸發，Aggregate Balance 減少，從2022年底的96.3億港元下降至2023年底的45.0億港元。與此同時，未償還的遠期外匯掉期（EFBNs）在全年微升，從1,200.4億港元上升至1,245.5億港元。因此，Aggregate Balance 與未償還的遠期外匯掉期總額從2022年底的1,296.7億港元下跌至2023年底的12,904億港元（圖2）。貨幣基礎全年充分獲得外匯儲備的支持。\n\n圖2 截至2023年，結餘總額（未經貼現窗處理）及未償還的聯邦基金票據。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據LERS，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）更廣泛層面追蹤其美元有關當局。隨著美國持續上調利率，在2023年頭6個月上升（圖3）。全年，隔夜、1個月和3個月的HIBORs 分別上升了286、92和16個基點，至年底達到6.09%、5.27%和5.15%。\n\n以下聯邦資金利率目標範圍的上升，基於利率經調整上升四項，總計一個百分點（即100個基點），由5.75% 上升至 5.75%。1 在零售方面，隨著美國政策利率上調，許多銀行在年初5月和年底7月分別上調了12.5個基點和另12.5個基點的最高貸款利率。部分銀行在當年亦上調了經核准的新按揭貸款的HIBOR基於按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率從2022年的3.35% 上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。貼現窗借貸上升至2023年的38.8億港元，較2022年的8億港元，相關使用率未見異常。\n\n圖3 二零二三年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯邦元掛虛動態機制（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的雄厚支柱，已在過去的十年中體現出其力量與韌性。儘管持續存在關於美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦的不明朗因素，港元匯率及貨幣市場持續以有秩序的方式運作，反映了聯邦元掛虛動態機制的穩健。政府堅決承諾聯邦元掛虛動態機制。在2023年的外部部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，聯邦元掛虛動態機制的4項可信性已由一套透明的規則、大量財政及外匯儲備、雄厚的金融監管與監察、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架設立。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對 LERS 的正常運作重要。香港的銀行業持續暢順運作，流動性狀況與資本化表現以及在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金管局已緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的壓力測試結果，並維持其對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，一筆特定的部分交換基金資產已被配置用於支持貨幣基地。支持比率（定義為支持資產劃分於貨幣基地）於2022年底從110.12%上升，至2023年5月4日達到高點112.71%，超越了112.5%的上限啟動級別（圖4）。這主要反映了由於上半年疲弱側CU的啟動，總體餘額的收縮結果。根據交換基金諮詢委員會核准的安排，以及償還債務憑證的結果，資產從支持投資組合轉移到投資投資組合，以將支持比率減低至約109.97%於5月8日。此後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收於110.73%。根據LERS，雖然有特定的交換基金資產被指定用於支持投資組合，但所有交換基金資產都可用於支持港幣匯率。交換基金充足的財務資源，以及健康穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強而有力的支持。\n\n圖4 2023年支持比率的每日變動。\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會小組\n\n貨幣發行局諮詢委員會的貨幣局次委員會（CBC）監察聯邦與貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。二零二三年，CBC 審議了包括二零二二年五月穩定幣市場崩盤、聯邦儲備局美元流動性支持措施回傳至香港銀行的情況，以及近期香港 dollar 利率的變動等問題。 CBC 就這些問題的討論錄得，以及提交給 CBC

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年儘管面臨多個挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行風波、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張，仍然維持雄厚且具韌性。香港金管局迅速應對三月的銀行風波——從管理漣漪效應到完成內部審查（包括監管流程和解決框架等範疇），汲取經驗，為本地銀行業提供經驗，同時維持對持牌金融機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於日益嚴峻的網絡安全威脅以及第三方提供技術服務的使用增加，香港金管局亦與持牌金融機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n金管局提升了支付卡消費者保護方面，並透過進一步修訂銀行業行為守則以及推出反詐騙消費者保護憲章。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化了高端專業投資者的銷售流程，提升了跨境財富管理聯系計劃試驗計劃，並開始監察信託業務。已推出一項試驗計劃，為提供“信用數據智能”下的消費者信貸參考服務作準備。\n\n香港金管局在打擊洗錢及反恐融資 (AML\/CFT) 方面的努力，展現了以風險為本的方式應對最高風險的承諾。為應對增加的 цифровая мошенничество，金管局已通過推出實時欺詐監測及拓寬公私部門信息分享合作，加強了生態系統合作。這些合作包括欺詐及洗錢情報工作組。推出一個突破性的平台，以便利銀行間信息分享，將有助於應對驢帳戶網絡的風險，而金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理增加的與欺詐相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統時的交易前警報機制。與此同時，宏觀分析試驗計劃也提升了監管科技能力。\n\n在實施國際監管標準方面，本地取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和信息披露等。亦有顯著努力加強金融業的建設能力，吸引並培育未來人才，提升現有從業者的技能。此外，香港存款保障局完成了一項關於存款保障計劃建議提升的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局持續推動其工作，以確保可信的重組機制。 一項與獲取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新重組標準已制定完成，並且就實施損失吸收能力政策標準的經驗進行了審查。 在與銀行進行重組規劃方面取得了重大進展，以應對初期的終止風險和運作的持續性。 金管局亦持續參與國際政策倡議和區域重組合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的普遍目標是推動銀行體系的 安全與穩定。 達成此目標取決於一個具韌性的金融體系，這個體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務的方式影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下，甚至可能因失序而倒閉。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在保護金融穩定方面擔當關鍵角色，確保銀行具韌性，能夠在應對危機時復甦其狀況，最終協助預防失敗。 金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款公司，統稱認可機構 (AIs)。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決方案權威機構，旨在確保在AI不可持續經營時，其倒閉可以有秩序地管理。為此，已在香港建立了一套針對金融機構的解決方案制度，根據該制度，金管局是AI等其他類別機構的解決方案權威機構。為了在香港推行解決方案制度，制定解決方案規則和政策標準至關重要，同時需要進行解決方案規劃，以消除AI可解決性方面的障礙，並發展金管局解決失敗AI的運作能力。為了更有效地執行這些工作，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金融管理局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。在監察FMIs時，金管局旨在推動它們的普遍安全與效率，限額系統性風險，並促進透明度。 制定FMIs更具韌性以應對金融危機，有助於保護香港的貨幣和金融系統免受FMIs中斷可能產生的 destabilising 影響。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n在該年，金管局向兩間註冊於香港以外的銀行發放了一個銀行牌照和一個限制性銀行牌照。金管局亦向四間外國交易平台營運商發放了貨幣經紀牌照，並撤銷了先前給予一間貨幣經紀的另一個牌照。金管局在該年撤銷了五間持牌銀行授權。\n\n關於人工智能及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，請於附件及D至F表格，於第313至316頁及第322至325頁分別查閱。\n\n# 三層銀行體系審查\n\n在2023年，香港金管局進行一項全面的審查，針對三層次銀行體系，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。審查查閱顯示，現行的三層次體系已比為取得最初的目標——在銀行系統的靈活性與保護小型存款人之間取得平衡——所需要的更廣泛層面。其後，香港金管局於6月開始為期三個月的諮詢，就將三層次銀行體系簡化為兩層次的建議案進行討論，透過將收妥存款公司併入受限制牌照銀行業，從而形成香港銀行體系的第2屆新層次。受訪者普遍支持此建議。\n\n# supervisory activities 的總覽\n\n在2023年，香港金管局進行了177次現場審查，涵蓋了廣泛的種類問題，包括CAMEL評級評估，企業管治和風險管理。作為香港金管局持續努力推動更強的風險管治的一部分，與虛擬銀行董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，香港金管局、虛擬銀行及其外部審計師之間還舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了離地活動外，香港金管局在現場進行了對廣泛種類的金融機構活動的定期審查。 由於高利率環境以及部分內地物業開發商的債務違約，信用風險管理是重點，給予了高度關注。 在金融機構加速採用科技的趨勢下，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦是另一個主要重點。 香港金管局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出了一輪以氣候相關風險治理為重點的主題審查，以及一系列諮詢環節，以提供監管指引給金融機構。\n\n自二零二三年三月開始，美國和歐洲爆發的銀行風波，在規模和範圍上，是自二零零八年金融危機以來一場最重大、影響系統性的銀行壓力事件。香港金管局在風波發展期間保持高度警惕，並採取了一系列預防性行動，以確保任何潛在的後果不會動搖對本地銀行和金融體系的信心。事件發生後，香港金管局進行了一項內部審查，顧及從風波中獲得的觀察和經驗。基於這項審查，香港金管局制定了一項詳細的行動計劃，旨在將吸取的經驗融入其中，以加強其監管效能，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的「流動資金及市場風險」一節，了解香港金管局在這方面的工作。\n\n在進行監察方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險以及強制性公積金（MPF）相關的業務，以及消費者保護事務，進行了現場審查，並配合對評估風險較高或新舉措的範疇進行主題審閱。\n\n表一載有香港金管局2023年的監管活動概要。\n\n表一 監管活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款在2023年減少了3.6%，相比2022年的下跌3.0%。 表格2列明了貸款和推進的增長細節。 內地相關貸款在2023年減少了6.6%，降至4,226億港元（表格3）。\n\n表 2 貸款及 推進 的增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n在2023年，金管局加強了監察人工智能相關資產質素及評估其信貸風險管理措施的努力，

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n在2023年，香港金管局利用多管齊下的方法，取得顯著進展，鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心 的地位。\n\n兩項主要活動的成功，即全球金融領導人投資峰會和香港金管局-巴塞爾銀行業中央銀行國際委員會高層次會議，鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生了正面影響。\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局取得努力，深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場的互惠途徑。這包括對粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃的提升，為債券通南向交易指定額外市場造市商，北向交易交換通順利推出，以及推出港幣-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台市場造市計劃。 這些舉措有效加強了香港的樞紐地位，並鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務中心的地位。\n\n香港金管局亦取得良好進展，加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續融資，以及企業財務中心等範疇。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強了其市場外展活動，向海外及內地持份者保持以及了解香港金融市場的機會及其韌性。\n\n香港金管局「金融科技2025」策略在各個範疇都取得重大進展，包括推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數字貨幣、數據基礎設施、人才發展，以及政策和資金支持等範疇。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於九月慶祝五周年。註冊數字穩定上升，截至2023年底已達到1360萬。該年平均每日成交額上升至125萬筆即時交易。FPS與泰國PromptPay的跨境QR支付連結，於12月聯合泰國銀行推出，為往返兩地方的人民提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及區域中央銀行和監管機構組織的積極成員，香港金管局持續貢獻於維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力。\n\n# 概述\n\n貫穿全年，香港金管局持續努力加強香港作為國際金融中心之競爭力。11月，它舉辦了第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。這項為期三天的活動吸引了來自世界各地的傑出金融領導人，約350名參加者分享了他們獨特的視野，主題為「與複雜共存」。 峰會匯集了來自160家國際金融機構的參加者，清楚地展現了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。 同月，香港金管局與國際銀行同業銀行聯合舉辦了香港金管局-國際銀行同業銀行高層會議，吸引了超過3,000億名參加者，包括20位現任及前中央銀行行長。會議突顯了香港金管局與國際銀行同業銀行以及國際中央銀行體系之間的緊密合作。\n\n廣東與香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）跨境財富管理聯通計劃（跨境WMC）一系列提升，已強化香港作為中國內地與國際金融市場之間的橋樑作用。透過南向債券通的暢順運作，香港金管局指定9名額外做市商，以改善次級流動性，符合投資者需求。同期，北向交易交換基金聯通計劃成功推出，讓全球投資者能透過香港，更好管理其中國內地固定收益投資組合的利率風險，取得相關的便利。\n\n香港離岸人民幣業務見證了顯著增長。香港金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所（HKEX）合作，於6月推出港幣-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台市場製作計劃。這幫助發展了在香港更多元化的等值人民幣產品種類，促進了在香港發行及交易等值人民幣股份。\n\n香港金管局持續工作，加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其，為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，香港金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。亦取得重大進展，推動香港債券市場的創新，鞏固香港作為區域性綠色及可持續融資中心的地位。與此同時，香港金管局亦加強了市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者推動香港的金融服務。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及香港金管局的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。

加強金融科技的跨境合作；及\n- 拓寬FPS的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，對於維持其作為領先國際金融中心的地 4項 地位至關重要。 2023年，四個銀行間即時總額結算系統、中央結算系統 (CMU) 以及香港交易存儲庫 (HKTR) 實現了 100% 系統可用性，超出 99.95% 的目標。 包括南北向債券通對接服務在內的債務證券結算服務，持續暢順運作。\n\n電子錢包的應用持續增加，2023年標誌著FPS達到五周年這個重大里程碑。過去五年間，FPS的登記數字和成交額持續增長，截至2023年底，登記數字增長至1360萬，全年平均每日成交額較2022年上升了33%。使用FPS支付政府賬單、商戶付款以及增值儲值易（SVF）電子錢包或銀行戶口，是促使交易量持續上升的關鍵因素，除此之外，人際間和商戶之間的付款也呈現穩定的持續增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的 安全 及 效率，香港金管局 監管 六項 指定 的零售支付系統（RPSs）（其中 4項 由持牌銀行發出的 SVF）並根據《支付系統及儲值易貨便利店條例》（PSSVFO）對 17 間持牌 SVF 進行監察。 期間，香港金管局 亦 持續 便利 政府消費券計劃的 暢順 執行， 協助 協調 參與計劃的相關 政府 第三方 及 為計劃 委任 的 SVF 持牌機構，並促進他們之間的 對話及 合作。\n\n12月27日，金融服務及財富管理局與香港金管局聯合發布了關於穩定幣發行人的監管公開諮詢文件。其後，香港金管局於2024年3月12日推出了一個試驗計劃，以供計劃在香港發行與法定貨幣掛鉤的穩定幣的機構使用。與此同時，香港金管局一直積極參與與加密資產活動相關的國際組織工作，並密切監察市場的發展。\n\n國際上，香港金管局維持為中央銀行社群的積極成員，並且持續在多個地區性及國際委員會中扮演領導角色。現正，香港金管局亦同時擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策與標準小組主席，以及亞洲地區諮詢小組、非銀行監察專家小組（至6月）和金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡主席。香港金管局亦主席國際銀行業論壇（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體央行理事會議。在2018年至2023年間，香港金管局擔任東亞太平洋地區中央銀行理事會議（EMEAP）下建立的金融市場工作小組主席的連續條件。\n\n金管局亦於五月及七月分別舉行了與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及沙烏地阿拉伯中央銀行的雙邊會議，以推動中東與亞洲之間的投資及金融市場互聯互通。第九月二十五日於伯爾尼、瑞士舉行了第六次香港-瑞士金融對話，討論的題目涵蓋了區域及國內前景、政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技和市場互聯互通範疇內的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n二零二三年投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然年初美國和歐洲的一些銀行出現了流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。儘管主要發達經濟體的通貨膨脹水平已從二零二三年高位下跌，但仍維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能接近或位於高位。這以及具韌性的美國經濟，使得投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張，例如俄烏戰爭以及年中發生於中東的衝突，為投資市場新增了波動和不明朗因素。在這複雜且多變的投資環境中，投資基金的投資表現出現了一些起伏。儘管如此，投資基金仍管理取得了一良好投資回報。二零二三年，投資基金錄得投資收入為港幣2,260億，標誌著5.5%的投資回報。\n\n# 匯生基金\n\n匯生銀行莊的 主要目標， 依照《匯生銀行條例》 制定，是直接或間接 影響 香港的貨幣匯率。 該基金 亦可能 運用 以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的 健全 及穩定， 協助 維持香港作為國際金融中心。 金融管理局在財政司長的 轉授權 範圍內， 依照 轉授 的 條件， 對匯生銀行莊的使用及投資管理負責財政司長。\n\n# 投資基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（聯匯諮詢委員會）已為聯匯基金設立以下目標。\n\n（一）保障資本；\n（二）確保整體貨幣【基地】，隨時都以【等值】美元資產【流通性高】充分【保障】；\n（三）確保有【足夠】的流動性，以【目的】於【維持】貨幣及金融穩定；及\n（四）【受...限制】於（一）–（三），以【取得】一項投資回報，該回報將【協助】【維持】基金【長期】的【購買】力。\n\n這些目標 採取 全面 考慮 交易所基金的法定 目的，並 註冊 到基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置中（圖 1）。\n\n圖一 聯匯基金的投資組合劃分\n\n總體而言，外匯基金擁有兩項主要的投資組合：支持性投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP 持有極高流通性的美元資產，主要提供對貨幣基地全面支持，這符合按貨幣券制度的規定。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券和股本市場，旨在保障其資產的價值和長期購買力量。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金管局將部分投資組合多元化，以審慎且循序漸進的方式，擴展至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資工具計劃持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別一起釐定，受審慎風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略的受...限制。\n\n策略投資組合，於2007年建立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，這些股份是政府為交易所基金的策略目的而購入的。 由於其獨特的性質，策略投資組合未刊載於基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與匯生基金的投資安排\n\n聯匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率更廣泛層面掛鈎於投資組合1的表現。一個個別例子是未來基金2，其利率根據投資組合和LTGP的回報，根據其投資組合比例而定。未來基金2在2023年，投資組合中，投資組合1與LTGP的比例約為35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程支持著兩類資產配置的決定：戰略性資產配置和短期配置。戰略性資產配置，反映在投資基準中，代表著基於聯匯基金投資目標的長期配置。以…為指引的戰略性配置，資產會戰略性地配置，以爭取超越基準的優勢回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置的差距稱為“短期偏差”。雖然基準和循跡誤差3限額由財政司長諮詢聯匯基金監察委員會後釐定，但短期決策和短期偏差的容許範圍由香港金管局在轉授權下取得和設立。在短期偏差容許的範圍內，投資組合經理可能管理狀況以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金管局的投資事務部專責管理投資基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。投資基金投資事務部成員直接管理投資基金約71%的投資，包括BP的整體及IP的部分。內部管理的IP部分包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及不同衍生工具套用於實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理員\n\n鑑於內部管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外部基金經理管理約29% 聯邦匯款基金的資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門的資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是汲取市場上最高投資專門知識，以獲取可持續的回報，此外亦汲取多元化和互補的投資方式，並利用外部市場見解和專門的投資知識的優勢。\n\n有關使用外部經理的管理支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易成本，以及預扣及其他稅款。此項支出主要由市場因素釐定，可能不同於年年。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好的風險管理日益重要。香港金管局設定嚴格的監控和投資指引，適用於其內部及對外管理投資組合，並確保妥善的風險監察及合規系統已制定。已制定三道防線，以推行有效風險管理和投資相關活動的治理。關鍵風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及營運風險）獲定期監察。風險管理流程提供了一個穩健的框架，支持香港金管局的策略規劃和投資多元化努力。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金管局相信，對負責任投資和可持續長期經濟表現的適當強調，有助於更好地取得投資基金的目標，以及減低與其基礎投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關問題所帶來的風險。為積極支持負責任的投資實踐，香港金管局已將ESG因素併入投資基金的投資流程，其指導性原則是，如果其經調整的長期回報與其他投資相若，將優先給予ESG投資。更多關於香港金管局負責任投資工作 的詳情，請參閱《可持續發展報告2023》中的負責任投資章節。\n\n# 聯匯基金表現\n\n# 2023 年的金融市場\n\n二零二三年，投資環境既動盪又充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年更廣泛層面呈現向上趨勢。標普500指數當年上升了24%，加上在第四季市場開始比預期更快地預期減息。\n\n在債券市場，殖利率維持高位，10年期美國國債殖利率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來最高水平。然而，隨著市場對央行貨幣政策的預期改變，債券殖利率回落，隨着債券價格逐步增加，朝年底發展。\n\n在外匯市場，美元兌主要貨幣錄得不一的表現。之中，英鎊和歐元升值對美元，而日圓和人民幣貶值。\n\n二零二三年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現體現於表一。\n\n表一 2023 年市場回報\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 聯匯基金表現\n\n外匯基金錄得2,260億港元的投資收益。 其中包括債券收益1,447億港元、股本收益581億港元（其中外地股本收益736億港元，而香港股本則錄得155億港元的虧損）、非港元資產的負面匯率估值影響5億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資錄得237億港元的收益。

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate functions support the operations of the HKMA with a high level of transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of its policies and operations, the HKMA communicates actively with the community and market participants through traditional and social media, the HKMA website, the Information Centre and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is striving to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline, and upgrade its digital capabilities in order to adapt to changes and ensure its policies and initiatives are effectively implemented.\n\n# Transparency\n\n# Media relations and use of social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2023, the HKMA held or participated in 188 open press events, comprising 11 press conferences, six media briefings, 15 stand-up interviews and 156 other public functions. Over the course of the year, it also arranged a further 25 media interviews, issued 583 bilingual press releases and handled a large number of media enquiries on a daily basis.\n\nPress conferences and media briefings to raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media. Topics included anti-scam initiatives, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\nMedia representatives were active participants in events organised by the HKMA in 2023, in particular the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day event generated over 2,000 pieces of positive, factual news coverage in local, Mainland and international media.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, speaks at a media stand-up at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2023\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, conducts a media stand-up at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nMr Arthur Yuen (first from right), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a sharing session at the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter event\n\nMr Howard Lee (centre), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a media briefing on the e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 1 Report\n\nMr Darryl Chan (first from left), Deputy Chief Executive, moderates a panel discussion at the Treasury Markets Summit 2023\n\nCreative social media content helps to raise public awareness on the HKMA initiatives and a range of other topics\n\nTo engage with the public more effectively, the HKMA operates six social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube), which collectively have over 150,000 followers. The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.\n\nYoung visitors learn about the design of banknotes in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre\n\nGuided tour of the Information Centre for kindergarten students\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nSince 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme that reaches out to the community to raise public awareness of its work. To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

企業職能\n\n企業職能以高透明度、問責制、效率和專業水平支持香港金管局的運作。為推動公眾對其政策和運作的了解，香港金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、香港金管局網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，積極與社區和參加者溝通。\n\n內部，香港金管局正努力建立靈活應變且專業的團隊，維持嚴格的紀律，並提升其數位能力，以便適應變化，確保其政策和倡議能更有效地實施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體的使用\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。 2023 年，金管局舉辦或參與了 188 項開放新聞活動，包括 11 場新聞發佈會、六個媒體簡報會、15 則即席訪談及 156 項其他公眾活動。 在該年期間，金管局亦安排了另外 25 則媒體訪談，發佈了 583 份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n香港金管局舉辦了新聞發佈會和簡報會，以上調對其主要職能的意識，面向本地、內地及外國媒體。 題目包括防詐騙舉措、中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）和穩定幣。\n\n媒體代表積極參與香港金融管理局於2023年舉辦的活動，尤其包括第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。為期三天的活動在本地、內地及國際媒體中產生了超過2,000篇正面、客觀的新聞報道。\n\n葉志強先生，行政長官，於香港金融科技周2023年媒體發佈會上致辭。\n\n尤智明先生，行政長官，於全球金融領導人投資峰會舉行新聞發佈會。\n\n袁先生（右邊第一位），執行副總裁，於《防騙消費者保護憲章》活動中主持了一個分享環節。\n\n李先生（中），副行政總裁，主持關於電子港元試驗計劃第一階段報告的新聞簡報。\n\n陳先生（左起第一位），執行副總裁，主持了2023年金融市場峰會的委員會討論。\n\n創意社交媒體內容有助於上調公眾對香港金融管理局倡議的意識，以及其他題目的一系列種類。\n\n為更有效地與公眾互動，香港金融管理局運營六個社交媒體渠道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、微信、X（前稱Twitter）及YouTube），總計擁有超過15萬名追蹤者。香港金融管理局的主要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領導人投資峰會，均在其社交媒體渠道上直播，以提升公眾及業界的參與。香港金融管理局亦會開發具創意的社交媒體內容，以提升公眾對不同題目和舉措的意識。近期內容涵蓋了消費者保護及詐騙預防、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及香港金融管理局的重大事件。\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n金管局的公眾查詢服務規定了一個有效渠道，讓公眾可以展望更了解金管局的主要職能和運作。\n\n在2023年，公共查詢服務處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約一半與消費者銀行業務、銀行政策及規例、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣和硬幣有關。一些常見查詢的主題包括銀行產品及服務、硬幣收藏計劃、零售債券發行計劃、銀行相關的指引及通函，以及快速支付系統。\n\n圖一列明自2020年起公共服務部門收到的查詢數字，圖二規定了2023年收到查詢的性質。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖2 2023年收到查詢的性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n在該年，香港金管局載有其《2022年年報》與首份獨立《2022年可持續發展報告》。《2022年年報》於香港管理協會2023年《最高年報獎》中，於「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中收到金獎，為該類別的最高排名。與此同時， 《2022年可持續發展報告》在香港執業會計師公會2023年《最佳公司治理及ESG獎》中，於公共部門\/非牟利（大量）類別中贏得ESG獎。\n\n在2023年，香港金管局4項載有其半年貨幣及金融穩定局勢報告及十四期季刊，並定期更新其月度統計公佈，以提供及分析香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及重要資訊。香港金管局亦推出14篇inSight1文章，討論了重要的議題。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），載有近六成以英文以及傳統和簡體中文編寫的20,000頁內容，是公眾獲取香港金管局最新資訊的途徑。它載有持牌金融機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及根據《銀行條例》（BO）第20章維持的持牌金融機構證券人員登記冊，以及《支付系統及儲值易介數條例》下的儲值易介數牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n金管局自2018年起透過開放的API，分階段釋放金融數據及重要資訊於其網站。截至年底2023年，金管局已在網站上開立175組API，符合其目標時間表。\n\n香港金管局的開放API 平台：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於國際金融中心兩號大樓55樓，香港金融管理局資訊中心由一間展覽館和一間圖書館組成，旨在向社會大眾介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣和銀行事務的意識。互動式的展覽館介紹了香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展，連同研究香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的資訊和展品。\n\n在一年內，資訊中心接待了超過三萬一千多位遊客，並為學校和其他小組舉辦了超過四百八十場以…為指引的導覽活動。\n\n圖書館，位於展覽館旁邊，專責保存超過26,000冊關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的書籍、期刊及其他出版物，以及中央銀行題目。它亦維持人工智能及本地代表處的登記冊，以及人工智能的證券人員登記冊，供公眾根據《條例》第20章的要求查閱。\n\n年輕遊客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習了關於紙鈔設計的知識。\n\n以…為指引的導賞，為幼稚園學生。\n\n# 社區聯繫與公共教育\n\n自一九九八年起，金管局一直推行公眾教育項目，向社會宣傳其工作，以提高人民意識。 至今，已有超過六萬六千人參與了公眾教育項目。 二零二三年，金管局為來自五十八間中學的一千兩百多名學生和教師舉辦了一場網絡研討會。 研討會的題目包括金管局的工作概述、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融以及銀行業的事業機會。\n\n金管局致力教育市民，並鼓勵市民以身為精明和負責任的消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙和信用卡欺詐的上升，金管局持續透過不同媒體的努力，提醒公眾保持警惕。在《防詐騙消費者保護憲章》推出後，金管局推出了一項全新的意識提升活動，強調銀行和主要商戶承諾不會透過即時電子訊息要求個人和信用卡資料。金管局亦透過電台和社交媒體頻道，傳遞關於信用卡、個人貸款、線上購物、銀行服務和不同付款選項（包括「先買後付」產品）的提示。\n\n一則新的短片和動畫，以「保障您的個人鎖匙；提防詐騙連結！」為主題，展示了食人植物和動物陷阱。\n\n跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒成員不要點擊可疑的連結。\n\n動畫短片用以推動易來思。\n\n為支持環保，並汲取金融服務領域的技術推進，金管局鼓勵公眾成員發放電子利是（電子紅包），並建議於農曆新年期間，透過社交媒體和電台宣傳，考慮使用良好至全新的紙鈔派發實體利是。\n\n香港金管局亦旨在提升公眾對金融行業的了解，並上調年輕人對在該行業發展事業的興趣，從而擴大香港金融行業的人才儲備。鑑於其較早推出的短片一連串“中區人才四面睇”所收到的正面回饋，香港金管局推出了一系列名為“金融特種部隊：釋放新視野”的短片，重點介紹了金融行業的4項增長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。這輯短片利用電腦圖像及動畫，展示經驗豐富的市場從業員監管年輕人才，他們管理日常工作挑戰，提供一項簡要的介紹，聯繫行業內的工作機會及前景。\n\n短片一連串「金融特種兵：開創全新視野」旨在保持年輕一代緊貼金融領域的事業機會。\n\n來自不同範疇的導師，分享他們的專門知識和經驗給學生。\n\n為提升中學生理財知識，金管局與其他持份者合作舉辦「香港理財錦標賽」，是年已連續舉辦 20 年。主題為數碼及可持續經濟，活動幫助學生學習更多關於金錢管理、綠色及可持續發展、金融市場的現況以及事業範疇。亦刊載於線上問答比賽，收到約 2 萬份投稿，並有經驗豐富的專業人士提供指導，合作進行設計思考挑戰。\n\n# 錢財管理321\n\n金管局推出其第一款理財教育桌遊，名為「$mart Money Management 321」，與一間專注於桌遊製作的社會企業聯合設計及開發。這款桌遊旨在協助主要學校的學生學習不同方法，了解理財概念、金融科技和網絡安全，並在模擬環境中進行體驗。\n\n香港金管局於香港書展2023年接任一個攤位，推動該桌遊，它是展會上主要產品之一。此外，香港金管局舉辦一連串免費宣傳活動，刊載於社區中心的工作坊、小學學生試玩活動，以及為非政府組織的社會工作者和小學教師而設的培訓工作坊，以及在節日期間於PMQ 設立「慳錢妙招體驗中心」。\n\n香港金管局首創的理財教育桌遊「$mart Money Management 321」及「$mart Money Management 體驗中心」獲得多項國際設計大獎。\n\n於香港書展推出後，此桌遊將透過師資培訓工作坊、學生試玩環節以及PMQ的體驗中心進行宣傳。\n\n金管局亦與不同持份者聯合舉辦了一系列社區聯繫項目。 其中一個是跨代際外展教育計劃的第2屆階段，與一間教育機構聯合舉辦。 該計劃刊載於銀行模擬遊戲連同對話，應對幼稚園學生、他們的家長和老師，以及年輕人。\n\n金管局持續支持投資者及金融教育諮詢委員會的工作，推動香港的金融知識普及和金融能力提升。將會進一步探討與不同持份者合作，以最大化其社區聯繫工作所產生的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，金管局採用國際標準，就其適用於中央銀行營運的情況，在財務披露方面做出規定。這些包括香港財務匯報準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務匯報準則準備及呈述投資基金的財務報表。金管局亦在年度報告中提供詳細披露及廣泛產品費用項目和預算信息的分析。\n\n# 問責與管制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n一個香港金管局最重要的工作之一是管理貨幣和銀行系統的風險。風險管理在日常運作中進行，並透過策略規劃在較高層次進行。 兩高層次委員會，宏觀監察委員會和風險委員會，在香港金管局的風險管理框架下運作。 兩者均由香港金管局執行總裁擔任主席。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

匯生基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計報告 財政司長致\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了交易基金及其附屬機構（「小組」）於頁211至311所載的財務報表，該等報表包括交易基金及小組截至2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年終止日止的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，以及重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n在我看來，財務報表真實、公允地反映了基金在2023年12月31日的地位，以及該小組在截至該年止的財務績效和現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則 (“HKFRSs”) 妥善擬備，且符合根據《交換基金條例》(第66章)第7章由行政長官發出的指示。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據《流通資金條例》第7章及審計總署的審計準則，進行了我的審計。 該準則對我的職責有更詳細的描述，請參閱我的報告中關於審計財務報表章節的審計員職責部分。 我根據該準則保持對該小組的獨立性，並且已按照該準則履行了其他道德責任。 我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以提供我的意見的依據。\n\n# 審核重點\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，根據我的專業判斷，於截至2023年12月31止的全年審核財務報表時，最具重要性的事項。這些事項已在我的財務報表審核的範圍內得到解決，並且在形成我的意見時已納入考量，我不會就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資訊。該等其他資訊包括香港金管局二零二三年年報內刊載於的所有資訊，除財務報表及其隨附的審計報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此類資訊不表達任何形式的舉行。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式出現重大失實。基於我所做的工作，如果我認為該其他資訊存在重大失實，我必須報告這一事實。我在此顧及事項，沒有任何需要報告的。\n\n# 承用法定金融管理局及投資基金審核委員會審核委員會就財務報表所負的責任\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表須按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及行政長官根據《流通資金條例》第7章發出的指示，作出真實而公平的呈述，並就金管局認為為編製免責於重大錯誤（無論是因欺詐或錯誤引起）的財務報表而必需的內部控制負責。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣管理局負責評估該小組持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯絡基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察該小組的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得關於全年財務報表是否免於重大錯報的合理保證，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並發布一份包括我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高程度的保證，但並非保證，即使存在重大錯報，按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計也可能出現。錯報可能因欺詐或錯誤而出現，如果個別或總體上，合理預期會影響基於這些財務報表的用戶所做的經濟決定，則被視為重大。\n\n作為審計準則審計的其中一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並貫穿審計過程保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以提供意見的依據。因欺詐而未偵測到重大錯誤的風險，高於因錯誤而產生的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽不實或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n取得有關審計的內部控制的了解，以便設計在情況下適當的審計程序，但並非為了表達對小組內部控制有效性的意見；\n評估所使用會計政策的適當性，以及貨幣總署所做的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n結論貨幣總署使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性，並基於取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對小組持續經營的能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在我的審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或者如果這些披露事項不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於在我的審計報告日之前取得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致小組無法繼續持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體頒獎典禮、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了基礎交易和事件；以及\n取得有關小組內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的足夠適當的審計證據，以對財務報表表達意見。我對小組審計的指導、監督和執行負責。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組溝通，其中包含審計範圍及時間的計劃，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部監控不足。\n\n我亦向聯匯諮詢委員會審核小組提供聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能被認為與我的獨立性相關的關係及其他事項，以及適用的相關保障措施。\n\n從與聯匯基金諮詢委員會審計小委員會有聯繫的 問題 中，我判斷在審計本 期間 的財務報表時，最為重要的 問題，因此是關鍵審計 Problem。 我會在審計師報告中描述這些 Problem，除非法例或規章禁止公開披露該 Problem，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為將 Problem 溝通會合理預期會產生不利後果，而這些後果會超過公開溝通所帶來的公共利益。\n\n林志源教授\n審計主任\n\n# 主要活動\n\n貨幣審查局作為匯儲基金經理，根據財政司長的轉授權，根據《匯儲基金條例》(第66章) 的條文管理該基金。該基金的主要職責是保護香港的貨幣匯率價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產由四項投資組合管理：支持投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略投資組合。支持投資組合的資產完全符合香港貨幣發行制度下的貨幣基地。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所和清算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的購入。運作細節請參閱第31期附註。\n\n#

2.11）。\n\n遵照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的申請以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告數字。這些估計及相關假設基於過往經驗及不同其他因素，而這些因素被認為在當時情況下是合理的，其結果構成了制定資產及負債賬面價值判斷的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非能從其他資料來源顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續地進行檢討。若修訂的估計僅影響該期間，則會於估計被修訂的期間確認相關修訂；若修訂影響當前及未來期間，則會於修訂期間及未來期間確認相關修訂。\n\n管理層在香港財務報告準則的申請中，所作的決定，若對財務報表有重大生效，以及估計不確定性的主要資料來源，均在附註2.18中披露。\n\n若干比較數字已重新陳述，以符合本年小組財務報表的頒獎典禮。\n\n# 附屬公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由該小組控制的實體。當該小組對其與該實體的參與有變動回報的風險，或擁有相關權利，並且能夠透過對該實體的力量來影響這些回報時，就被認為控制該實體。在評估該小組是否具有力量時，僅考慮實質性權利（由該小組和其他第三方所持有）。\n"}
