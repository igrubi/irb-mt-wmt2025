{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

but」、跌宕起伏）。\n\n美中貿易摩擦仍然是一個大驚濤駭浪的變數。持續的不確定性削弱了全球兩大經濟體之間的研討會，動搖了投資者的信心，並削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資，甚至消費。不再有全球經濟增長是理所當然的時代。全球經濟在當年進入了同步放緩的狀態。鑒於放緩的增長，各國主要央行已轉而改變其貨幣政策正常化的方向。\n\n本港方面，年初發生於下半年的一系列社會事件，對香港經濟造成了另一打擊。零售、旅遊和餐飲業當中受打擊最受打擊。2019年整體而言，香港經濟下跌了1.2%，是十年首個年度下跌，而失業率從年初的多年低點2.8%上升至3.3%。隨著2020年來臨，新型冠狀病毒 (COVID-19) 的爆發帶來了又一重大挑戰，對全球及本港經濟體仍然構成挑戰。\n\n面對如此不確定且困難的環境，維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定至關重要，正如我於2019年10月擔任香港金管局執行總裁時作出明確的說明。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n儘管自1983年以來實行的聯繫匯率制度（LERS）幫助香港抵禦多次挑戰和衝擊，展現了其作為香港經濟繁榮和國際金融中心地位的基石的重要作用。近月，儘管內外環境困難，LERS仍然以暢順且有序的方式繼續運作，再次證明了其在不確定性時期的韌性。香港的銀行系統也仍然穩健且強大。事實證明（事實勝於雄�辯）：香港元匯率仍然穩定，並在兌換範圍內增強，而銀行存款在當年繼續增長。簡單而言，沒有觀察到香港元或銀行系統有明顯的資金流出。\n\n香港的貨幣和銀行體系穩定，反映了對我們的體系既有強大信心，亦有穩健的基礎。這並非一夜之間發生，而是經過多年努力建立緩衝，加強監察，並輔以對社交媒體平台上的謠言迅速的回應。\n\n我們多年來為雨天所做的準備，建立了一穩固的根基，並為香港的貨幣和銀行系統提供了強大的緩衝。除了我們公共資金中龐大的外匯儲備外，我們的銀行系統擁有強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常良好的資產品質，無論依照國際標準或歷史標準皆是如此。自2009年以來落實的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，針對物業按揭，亦大大加強了銀行對房地產市場逆轉的抵禦能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監管構成了我們維持貨幣及銀行穩定的核心工作，並且我們不時地加強我們的監察及監管框架。除了緊密監察銀行信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的一項新猷是利用科技及從銀行收集的細緻數據，提升我們監察港元融資及金融市場活動的能力，以更深入及適時的方式。 鑒於快速變化中的經濟及營運環境，壓力測試及應急計劃亦得到加強。\n\n事實上，我們健全的監管制度已獲得國際間的強大認可。 該年，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具備應對周期性及結構性變化的良好條件，鑒於其重大緩衝。香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資的有效法律及制度框架，也由金融行動工作群組（FATF）取得正面結果，使香港成為亞太區首個在FATF互評中取得整體合規結果的區內地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，對保障貨幣及金融穩定至關重要。為了維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能造成懷疑於香港貨幣或銀行系統的惡意謠言保持警覺，並迅速回應。鑒於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這尤其重要。5月社會事件爆發期間，恐慌製造者在社交媒體平台傳播了不同謠言，但我們透過社交媒體，以及傳統媒體，迅速且明確的澄清，證明了其有用性和有效性，有效制止不實謠言的傳播，並維持國際社會和公眾對我等系統的信心。\n\n# 銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱。\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會和經濟的暢順運作中發揮基本作用。儘管自下半年起營運環境十分困難，銀行們與其他一同努力，竭盡全力維持其核心功能的正常運作，並繼續服務企業和公眾。\n\n此外，除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的一個重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實際經濟。我們對中小企在困難經濟狀況下所面對的資金周轉問題深表明白及關切。在保障銀行體系穩定的同時，我們推出了一系列舉措，以確保繼續向中小企提供融資支持。特別是，銀行反周期資本緩衝率在10月和3月分別在兩次出現，總共下調了150個基點至1.0%；銀行監管儲備金要求水平亦在4月下調了一半。這些措施釋放了約一萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多空間向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，匯聚金管局周邊的各大銀行，以探索和討論具體措施，加強向中小企提供融資支持。我樂見不少銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，並推出如為有需要的客戶提供還息不還本等紓緩措施，以克服難關。\n\n鑒於部分中小企反映開立銀行帳戶存在困難，這是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們過去幾年作出致力努力應對這個問題。我們的工作已見成效，企業開立帳戶的改善可見。為進一步推動金融普惠，金管局推動推出分層帳戶服務——簡易帳戶（簡易帳戶），其客戶審查流程已精簡——為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。至今已開立超過2,800個簡易帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上。\n\n我們一直留意到在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡的需要。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心之競爭力，從而確保其更長期之穩定。當中主要工作範疇有四：科技、綠色金融、與內地嘅金融互聯互通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向科技的時代\n\n香港自2016年設立金融科技促進辦事處，並於2017年引入智慧銀行倡議後，在發展推動金融科技方面進展快速。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力可見一斑，在轉數快（FPS）的採用上呈現強大勢頭，它是全球首個多幣、跨行及電子錢包的實時零售支付平台。短短15個月，FPS的登記數目已達到750萬，相當於在人口750萬的市民中，滲透率高。政府亦已採用FPS，為市民提供更方便繳交稅款、水費及其他費用的方式。越來越多的企業預計將使用這個快速、安全及方便的收取及付款方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業，應用金融科技於銀行服務及商業營運方面看到重大進展。根據香港金管局進行的一項研究，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用，或計劃採用人工（智能）於其業務應用。在香港金管局的促成下，銀行亦正應用大數據及消費者行為（分析）於其個人信貸產品。他們亦已在首個兩階段推出超過800個開放應用程式編程介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品及服務。在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，我們並未忽略對加強數字銀行服務中的科技風險管理及消費者保護的需要。適時的監管指引已提供予銀行於這些範疇。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行們特別感興趣的另一領域，因為它有潛在的成效，支持銀行有效且有效益地進行監管合規和風險管理，特別是在打擊洗錢和反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進更大規模的行業採用 Regtech 並建立更廣的 Regtech 生態系統，香港金融管理局舉辦了首屆 AML\/CFT Regtech 論壇，並於11月發布了首個 Regtech 電子報，以探討 Regtech 的可能應用情況。與此同時，香港金融管理局作為銀行監管機構，正探討使用監管科技（Suptech），包括新科學數據分析，以提升工作成效和效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年落實 Suptech 的藍圖。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這僅是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。香港金管局當年批出8張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他幾家虛擬銀行則已通過香港金管局的金融科技監管沙盒開始進行試點。我期待其他虛擬銀行推出，以及更多創新和多元的銀行服務引入市民，將有助於提高我哋銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n更多精彩發展亦預期會在國際層面出現。在成功完成一項試驗，以將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect 與其歐洲對接夥伴成功連接後，我們正在進行另一項試驗，與中國人民銀行平台進行對接，鋪路於跨境貿易的數碼化。我們已開始與泰國銀行展開一項聯合研究項目，研究中央銀行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行亦在11月於香港投入首個創新中心運作，以促進中央銀行社群內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都呈現出香港在金融科技發展領域領先全球的明確證據。\n\n# 推動綠色及可持續的金融，為更美好的未來。\n\n氣候相關風險近月備受全球關注。為貢獻全球應對這項挑戰的努力，香港金管局公布了三項關鍵措施，於5月在不同領域推動香港綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局正推動一個三個階段的方案，以推動綠色及可持續的銀行業。第一階段已制定評估銀行「綠色基準」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定對銀行業的監管期望及要求，以及第三階段的落實鋪路。\n\n作為投資基金的經理，香港金管局積極推進責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（環境、社會及管治）因素納入其投資活動。具體而言，我們採用優先（考慮）綠色及環境、社會及管治投資的原則，若其長線回報與其他投資相若，則優先考慮。早於2015年投資者中較早加入綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續增長我們的綠色債券投資組合，並投資於其他環境、社會及管治資產。我們亦將攜手理念相近的投資者及監管機構，透過參與環境、社會及管治社群的國際組織，推動最佳 практики。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

的 壓力。\n\n香港銀行業 保持 穩健 及 有韌性，擁有 強大 的資本基礎、充沛的流動性及 健康 的資產品質。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管外部和內部環境困難，香港的貨幣制度穩固不搖，反映在穩定的港幣匯率和外匯及貨幣市場暢順的運作。這反映了香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦強大展現了對香港貨幣制度的信心。\n\n一項新解決方案機制被引入，並作出多項優化措施，於香港金管局修訂的流動性便利設施框架內。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局投放巨大努力監控銀行信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行穩定。亦作出良好進展，推動智慧銀行發展，包括授予8間虛擬銀行牌照，並鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力輔以加強對銀行科技風險管理的監管，以及加強數字金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n金管局理順投資者保護措施，以提升客戶經驗，並在舉措上進一步推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的打擊洗錢及反恐融資制度，獲得了金融行動工作組（FATF）的正面評價，使其成為亞太區首個在FATF第四輪互評中取得整體合規結果的成員管轄區。\n\n新規則和法規推出，以提升銀行監管體系，符合最新的國際標準。為推動香港的綠色和可持續性銀行業，公布了三個階段的方案，成為應對氣候變遷的全球努力。\n\n同時，香港金管局作出重大進展，在將解決機制付諸實施方面，特別是推動在新系統性重要銀行建立一層新的損失吸收能力，以推動金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正增強強大勢頭，在銀行業中，首個開放應用程式介面框架的落實進展良好，同時設立了全球首個國際結算銀行創新中心，並且電子支付的快速增加持續不絕。\n\n香港 保持 堅定 作為離岸人民幣業務的全球樞紐的 立足點。在 粵港澳 大灣區 發展的 背景 下，與內地的金融互聯互通正被 加強，而香港 居民 獲得金融服務的機會也更加 方便。\n\n大量努力作出了開放新機遇，以特別提升香港金融平台的競爭力，尤其在基礎設施投資及融資、綠色金融和私募股本基金方面。\n\n香港金融學院設立，旨在作為金融領導力培育的卓越中心，以及貨幣和金融研究知識的寶庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受益於利好的投資環境，投資基金錄得創紀錄的第二高投資收益，達至2,622億港元，相當於6.6%的投資回報。\n\n金管局自成立以來，尤其在長期增長投資組合（LTGP）方面，深化其投資多元化的努力。LTGP自2009年起錄得年化內部報酬率12.6%。亦有鼓勵的進展，推動責任投資。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社會和市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，金管局重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律以及提升資訊安全，以應對新舉措落實所帶來的挑戰和工作複雜度增加。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在二零一九年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易衝突以及本地社會事件。隨著經濟狀況在當年下半年急升惡化，勞工市場面對增加的壓力。通脹亦因豬肉價格急升而增加。預計二零二零年的經濟表現將持續困難，因為新型冠狀病毒爆發雪上加霜，對已經轉弱的經濟造成影響。鑒於困難的經濟環境，政府和香港金管局推出措施支持經濟，尤其惠及家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n隨着2018年出現2.9%的增長，香港經濟在2019年收縮了1.2%，標誌着自2009年以來首個年度下跌。特別是，經濟在下半年進入衰退，季節性調整後的實際國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三和第四季度連續下跌（表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映了國內需求的大幅減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件對消費活動和情緒產生顯著影響，私人消費開支創下了自2003年以來首個年度下跌。整體投資支出在低迷的商業情緒下亦有所下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩和在美中貿易摩擦之下實施的額外關稅導致香港商品出口下跌。服務出口也創下了紀錄上最大年度下跌，因為社會事件帶來了入境旅遊的嚴重轉差。由於國內和再出口誘發的需求較小，商品和服務進口也轉差。從淨貿易角度來看，淨貿易在2019年對GDP 帶來支持（圖1），因為總進口下跌的速度甚至比總出口更快。\n\n鑒於強大的經濟 headwinds，政府於 2019 年 8 月至 12 月間推出多項措施，以減輕居民的負擔，保障就業，並支持企業，特別是中小企 (SMEs) 以及受重創的行業，例如零售、食品服務、運輸和旅遊業。為了讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並幫助緩和經濟週期，金管局於 10 月 14 日公布銀行反周期資本緩衝比率從 2.5% 減少至 2.0%，從而提供銀行更多靈活性，讓銀行可以釋放 200–300 億港元 的銀行信貸予包括中小企在內的企業，並且設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。在 9 月份，為中小企融資擔保計劃 (SFGS) 的 80% 擔保產品推出了一項新的紓緩措施，讓面對轉弱 現金流的中小企借款人可以申請還息不還本，以獲得即時支持。此外，在 12 月份推出了一項新的 SFGS 擔保計劃下的 90% 貸款擔保產品，以提供額外支持予中小企、具有相對較少經營經驗的企業，以及尋求設立自己事業的專業人士，以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n香港的率及貨幣市場於2019年以暢順有序的方式 функционировали。香港的率在全年大致保持穩定。隨著弱方聯繫方案在3月被觸發，金管局以7.85港元兌一美元的匯率，從銀行購買港元，並向銀行出售美元，導致根據設計的聯繫匯率制度下，集體結餘下跌。銀行同業利率在更長期端大致保持穩定，而短期利率普遍上漲。在零售層面，多項零售銀行在接近年底的10月，在美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍內的下調後，調低了最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量，銀行貸款總額在2019年增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升，而存款總額在當年增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n潛在的通貨膨脹率，剔除了政府的一次性紓緩措施的影響後，上升至2019年的3.0%，較2018年的2.6%有所上升。通貨膨脹的輕微增加主要帶動於豬肉價格上漲，這是由於自5月以來，豬肉供應受阻所致（圖2）。不包括基本食品項目，價格壓力在全年大致維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價指數中的房屋組成部分隨著新鮮私人住宅租金較早前的整合而下跌。更廣泛地說，名義工資的輕微增長以及商業租金的放緩增加有助於控制本地的經營成本。外部方面，進口價格的通貨膨脹溫和，符合一些香港主要進口來源地區的通貨膨脹下跌，這是在全球經濟增長放緩之下。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞動市場在2019年首個上半年大致仍然有韌性，但下半年 面對日益增加的壓力（圖3）。失業率在經過最初兩個季度維持在多年來的低點2.8%後，第三季度上升至2.9%，年底則上升至3.3%，其中消費和旅遊相關行業的失業率更顯示出可見的上升，在社會事件之下。整體勞動需求在當年後半年亦明顯收縮，總就業數目和私營部門空缺數目均下降。勞動需求的減少特別體現在零售、住宿及食品服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業範圍內。在供應方面，勞動力參與率輕微下降，部分原因是對於經濟衰退的周期性回應。在勞動市場 面臨日益增加的壓力之下，名義工資和收入增長在年底 顯示出減速的跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了急升的波動。首個四個月市場攀升後，由於對中美貿易摩擦升溫的擔憂（圖4），恒生指數在5月暴跌。隨着主要中央銀行發出更寬鬆貨幣政策的信號，6月股價在回應中有所回升，但在全球經濟增長放緩和本地社會事件在...之下，股價再次面臨壓力。在年底，隨著美國和中國大陸“第一階段”貿易協議的公布，股價重新爭取了一些上漲勢頭。恒生指數全年收於28,190點，錄得整體年增長9.1%。相反，平均每日成交額較早前下跌約19%。一家重大內地科技公司和一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，幫助通過首次公開招股（首次公開招股）籌集到的股本基金擴展至3,142億港元。香港連續第二年高踞世界各地通過首次公開招股籌集資金的榜首。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年首個五個月呈現強大反彈，但其後全年整體有所回落。年初氣氛因對中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩解而提升，部分原因在於此，但其後中美貿易摩擦再升級、持續的社會事件以及本地經濟狀況轉差，又令氣氛受挫。從5月到12月，整體房屋價格從峰值下調了5%，但由於首個五個月錄得10%的反彈，全年仍錄得5%的增長（圖4）。2019年成交量較較早前增加4%，達到59,797宗，反映了年初強勁的交易活動。房屋可負擔性仍然偏緊，價格收入比和收入負擔比分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於長線平均。為了協助購房者應付即時的房屋需要，香港按揭證券公司（HKMC）於10月期間調高了根據按揭保險計劃獲得按揭貸款的已落成住宅物業的價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更強大的下調壓力。特別是，零售物業的價格和租金自2008年全球金融危機以來錄得最大下調，反映了當年惡化的經營狀況。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港的經濟表現預計在2020年將會非常困難，與冠狀病毒爆發相關的短期下行風險重大。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊和交通，尚未從社會事件造成的干擾中恢復，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，在2020\/21財政預算中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放和在中小企支持基金下提供的新低息貸款，承諾100%政府擔保，預計將提供一些支持給經濟，尤其對家庭和中小企。2020年3月16日，金管局進一步將銀行反周期資本緩衝比率從1.0%下調至0.1%，這將讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預期因冠狀病毒爆發所產生的影響而面臨額外短期壓力的行業和個人。根據GDP構成分析，私人消費和投資可能仍然疲弱，因為消費者和企業信心脆弱。儘管政府消費將貢獻於經濟增長，但公共投資支出預計在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後將會放緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸的“第一階段”貿易協議被評估對本地經濟在短期內有輕微的正面影響。然而，香港的外部貿易表現仍然會受到疲弱的全球經濟增長和貿易流動影響。尤其，冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動減緩，例如在旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年的實際GDP增長在-1.5%到0.5%之間，而國際組織和私營部門分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n鑒於表現不佳的經濟狀況、私人住宅租金的整合以及輕微的進口通貨膨脹，預計2020年的通貨膨脹壓力將會趨於溫和。市場共識預測2020年的整體通貨膨脹率為1.8%，政府的項目則預測整體和核心通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞工市場，鑒於疲軟的經濟前景和冠狀病毒爆發，失業率在長期可能進一步上升。私營部門分析師預期2020年失業率將上升至約4%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020 年的經濟前景黯淡，面臨著數目眾多的不確定性和風險，包括源於全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、中國大陸的經濟表現、本地社會事件以及持續的新冠疫情所帶來的影響。特別是，持續的新冠疫情可引發更可見的全球經濟放緩以及資產的重新評估，其導致的不利宏觀經濟環境和更為收緊的金融條件將對國內實際活動造成進一步的壓力。然而，各主要央行更共同的努力來放寬其貨幣政策，或許能提供一緩衝，以對抗疫情帶來的負面經濟影響。\n\n# 金融業表現\n\n儘管2019年全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦以及本地社會事件等困難環境，香港銀行業仍然有韌性。銀行資產負債表的趨勢是穩定的，貸款和存款均適度增長。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況仍然穩固，資產品質維持良好。銀行業錄得盈利，平均資產回報率也維持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

兌換範圍的強大 範圍內 加強。 作為香港貨幣及金融 穩定 的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地見 其對 衝擊 的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港幣對美元在外匯市場的匯率在一個區間內保持穩定，該區間為每美元7.75–7.85港元。貨幣制度的結構特點是金管局的貨幣準備金安排，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由美元儲備支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n債務憑證，為由三家發行銀行發行之鈔票提供十足支持，附註。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通中的總結餘額，是銀行與香港金管局持有之清算賬戶餘額的合共。\n\n香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息憑證。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調整機制及金管局堅定 履行 兌換範圍承諾（CUs），以 保持 港元 兌換 匯率的穩定。當 對 港元 的需求 大於 供應，且 市場 匯率 轉強 至 兌換範圍 的 強勢 兌換範圍 7.75 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 在 …後 根據 要求 出售 港元 給 銀行，以 換取 美元。集體結餘 將 會 擴展，推動 港元 利率 下降，創造 貨幣 狀況，將 港元 回復 至 兌換範圍 內，範圍 介於 7.75 至 7.85。相反，如果 港元 供應 大於 需求，且 市場 匯率 疲弱 至 兌換範圍 的 弱勢 兌換範圍 7.85 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 根據 要求 從 銀行 買入 港元。集體結餘 將 會 收縮，推動 港元 利率 上升，將 港元 回復 至 兌換範圍 內。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性以及國內經濟轉弱，港元在2019年仍然保持穩定，並以暢順且有序的方式進行交易。年初，擴大的負港元-美元息差帶來了沽出港元、買入美元的套利活動，推動港元匯率接近弱方兌換範圍的7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續轉弱，弱方兌換範圍最終在3月被觸發八次。其後，港元繼續保持接近弱方兌換範圍的7.85。自接近年底的5月起，大量首次公開招股（首次公開招股）活動、企業股息支付需求以及半年結算帶來了強大的港元需求，使港元加強。儘管港元在半年標誌後略為下跌，但自10月接近年底起，重新獲得勢頭，並在年底接近強方兌換範圍。這反映了部分與股票相關的需求，包括新股集資，以及部分因接近年底流動性收緊而導致的短倉港元平倉。整體而言，港元匯率市場在2019年全年正常運行。\n\n由於疲弱邊境CU被觸發，Aggregate Balance總額（除折扣窗戶前）及未結清的短期外幣結算票據，從2018年底的11,362億港元，下跌至2019年底的10,787億港元（圖2）。在該年，金管局根據銀行要求，以7.85的疲弱邊境CU購買了總額221億港元，導致Aggregate Balance總額（除折扣窗戶前）從2018年底的764億港元，下跌至2019年底的543億港元。未結清的短期外幣結算票據在該年輕微增加，從1,059.8億港元增加至1,078.7億港元，反映了根據既有慣例發行短期外幣結算票據以吸收短期外幣結算票據的利息支出。貨幣基礎整體十足受到外匯儲備的支持。Aggregate Balance總額（除折扣窗戶前）及未結清的聯邦準備票據和票據在2019年底達到10,787億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在2019年，香港銀行同業利率的長期端大致保持穩定，而短期利率大致上揚（圖3）。短期利率亦經歷了更多波動，帶動因素是與新股集資相關的資金需求和季節性的資金需要。自2018年4月起，集體結餘的減少可能帶來了香港銀行同業利率對本地市場香港元資金供求變動的更高敏感度。\n\n基準利率於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共調低75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至11月早於2.00%。美國聯邦基金利率目標區間發展了三次，總計調低75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%，涵蓋整個年。在11月18至26日及12月19–31日，基準利率升至2.00%以上，反映了在該年最後兩個月，一夜之間及每月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）顯著上升的趨勢。因此，基準利率於2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，該公式將基準利率定為高於美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限50個基點，或一夜之間及每月HIBORs的五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。在零售方面，多項零售銀行在10月接近年底美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下降後，調低了最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。\n\n港幣遠期點差在首個兩個月擴闊，大致追蹤港幣-美元利率息差的變化，其中12個月港幣遠期點差於2月中旬曾達約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著負港幣-美元利率息差收窄，港幣遠期點差逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為保費。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場有序運作。貼現窗借貸金額由2018年的40.2億港元，降至2019年的38.3億港元。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度過去數十年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出大幅貢獻，並在多次區內及全球金融危機中見證其韌性。在社會事件發生當年的背景下，一向有數目無法根據事實的謠言在社交媒體上流通，對聯匯制度及香港的金融穩定懷疑。香港金管局果斷且積極地反駁謠言，並透過傳統及社交媒體釋除公眾的疑慮，再次肯定聯匯制度將仍然維持，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，香港金管局發布了數篇文章，幫助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流動及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，正如市場在整個年間的有序運作所反映。政府亦穩固地支持聯匯制度。公眾對政府承諾的信心，以及使用港元作為支付方式及保值手段，因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而得到進一步鞏固。在2019年與香港的第四次諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定一向支持聯匯制度，將其視為香港金融穩定的基石，並評論聯匯制度仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，其支持來自香港的透明規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行系統對 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系流動性高且穩健，流動性狀況和資本化均遠高於最低國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局已緊密監控銀行對信貸、流動性和利率風險以及壓力測試結果的管理，並持續加強對企業、物業相關和內地相關貸款的監管努力。 由於較上一年的總結餘額較小，銀行普遍加強了其流動性管理安排，並在管理日常資金狀況方面更加積極。此外，金管局一直保持與銀行的緊密對話，以確保市場中流動性的暢順回收，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的認購期間前後。在當年，未見任何結算凍結，貼現窗繼續有效且有效率地運作。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一筆具體外匯基金資產分配 用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2019年期間在109.9—112.1%的涵蓋範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限觸發級別。該比率於12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。在應急儲備金制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。若發生突如其來的衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，以及香港穩健的銀行體系，將提供強大的支持，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會 (CBC) 的聯絡委員會監察並審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的發出。 於2019年，CBC 考慮了包括有關 LERS 營運的事件研究、總結結餘與香港利率之間的關係、對 LERS 的期權市場觀點的提升及靈活方法，以及未來首次公開招股對 HIBOR 的影響等議題。 貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論錄得，以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行委員會營運報告，均刊登於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（HKIMR），前身為香港貨幣研究中心，致力於貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的**主題**進行**研究**。這**反映**在HKIMR

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

感謝業界的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件中繼續正常運作。 採納了努力以確保對公眾造成的干擾降至最低。 該年，金管局將其監管重點放在持牌機構的信貸及流動資金風險管理上。 鑒於網絡威脅不斷升級及業界對科技的增長依賴性，金管局加強了對持牌機構科技風險管理的監管。 在監管方面，金管局精簡了其投資者保護措施，以提升客戶經驗，並向客戶提供保護。 我們亦提升了數字金融服務中的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢和反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動工作組（FATF）對香港AML\/CFT體制進行的第4季互認評估的結果，整體上被評估為合規且有效，特別是在銀行業對風險有良好了解以及香港金管局在AML\/CFT中以風險為基礎的監管工作方面獲得正面認可。香港金管局繼續參與公共與私營部門合作，分享關於訛騙和洗錢的智能（人工智能），並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，金管局於2019年批出（牌照）8間虛擬銀行牌照，並公布了一個三個階段的方案，以促進香港綠色和可持續性銀行的發展。 金管局一直與銀行業保持緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程，並開展建立人才發展方面的舉措。\n\n同時，本地實施國際監管標準取得顯著進展，包括資本充足性標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額風險集中度標準。香港金管局亦繼續其工作，以確保為持牌金融機構作出可信的處置機制，包括實施關於損失吸收能力要求的規則，以提升持牌金融機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金管局的總體目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標的前提是金融體系具有高度的韌性，並且能夠提供香港經濟所需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其企業的經營方式影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下，甚至可能因失序而失敗。 金融管理局作為監察當局，在保障金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行有韌性以應對衝擊，並能在危機發生時恢復其地位，從而最終有助於預防失敗。 金融管理局負責在香港對銀行進行審慎監察。 其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款公司，這些公司統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。 金融管理局亦負責指定和監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，當局無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦非為確保零風險的金融體系而設計。相反，當局作為處置當局，致力確保在認可機構出現不可行情況時，其失敗能夠以有序方式處理。為此，已在香港設立了針對金融機構的處置制度，根據該制度，當局是認可機構的處置當局。為確保香港的處置制度能夠運作，制定處置相關的法律及政策標準，並進行處置規劃以移除對認可機構處置可行性的阻礙，以及提升認可機構處理失敗認可機構的能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，認可機構採取國際協調一致的方式。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# supervisory activities 的總覽\n\n在2019年，進行了196場非現場審查，涵蓋了廣泛的發出，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治、風險管理和金融科技策略。作為香港金管局繼續推動更強風險管治的努力’部分，與虛擬銀行董事會或董事級別委員會舉辦了26場會議。此外，香港金管局、虛擬銀行及其外部審計師之間舉辦了32場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局亦有進行定期現場審查，並配合對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。在該年，總共進行了 405 項現場審查和主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些審查和審閱的重點。另一重大重點是科技風險和營運風險管理。金管局同時增加針對流動性風險和市場風險管理以及落實巴塞爾資本充足度框架的現場審查和主題審閱的數目。同時，專業團隊對保險公司在證券、投資產品、保險和強制性公積金（MPF）相關企業的表現進行現場審查和主題審閱。\n\n表 1 包含香港金管局 2019 年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信貸風險監控\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款在2019年溫和地增加。總貸款增長了6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，香港境內貸款和香港境外貸款分別增長了7.7%和5.8%。\n\n相關貸款增長7.4%，至金管局年底錄得4,564億港元（表3）。\n\n人工智能的資產品質仍然健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率輕微下降，從2018年底的0.51%降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平2%。 具體而言，就銀行業整體而言，不良貸款比率從0.55%增加至0.57%。 尤其是在與相關的內地貸款方面，零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年的0.63%增加至2019年的0.79%，但仍然低於歷史標準。 對於銀行業整體而言，該比率增加至一年前的0.55%的75%。\n\n在該年，香港金管局加強了監管力度，以確保保險公司繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準，在不確定的經濟環境之下。壓力測試已加強，以納入更全面的風險覆蓋範圍和更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為的衝擊。針對性的和主題性審查被進行，以評估保險公司在不同範疇的信貸風險管理措施，例如向從事高風險業務的企業融資、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供抵押品融資。鑒於中小企（SMEs）在經濟下滑期間可能面對更大的挑戰，香港金管局於10月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，期望鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內繼續支持中小企的融資需要。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行業對抗房地產市場逆轉的能力，自2009年起，香港金管局引入的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施大幅加強。截至2019年12月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）降至53%，較2009年9月為64%。新按揭的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦在2019年12月降至36%，較2010年8月為41%，當時首次應用DSR上限（圖1）。\n\n# 營運與科技風險的監督\n\n金管局採用三個階段的方案，為實施網絡韌性評估框架，於網絡安全強化倡議 (CFI) 下進行。第一階段的評估，涵蓋所有主要的銀行，已於2018年落成。第二和第三階段涵蓋的其餘人工智能系統已按計劃基本完成評估。鑒於過去幾年所獲得的經驗，金管局亦開展了對CFI的全面檢討，以調整倡議。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局刊登了《監管政策手冊》（SpM）關於「電子銀行風險管理」的修訂模組。此修訂旨在提供更大的靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務的期望變化。香港金融管理局亦設立了一套高層原則，就人工（智能）在金融科技應用上提供指引。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，香港金管局一直與業界保持緊密對話，以監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行已獲要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快維修被破壞的設施。香港金管局亦迅速採取行動，闢謠，以駁斥旨在動搖公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。 由於銀行業共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施很快恢復正常營運，對公眾造成的不便亦被控制在最低限度。 鑒於社會事件帶來上升的營運風險，銀行被要求選持倉盤採取額外的預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性風險及市場風險管理監督\n\n在該年，一輪主題審查已進行，以評估金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。 審查重點關注金融機構流動性壓力測試計劃和應急資金管理之穩健性。 金融管理局亦評估金融機構遵守有關流動性保障比率（LCR）計算的監管要求，以確保計算所用輸入的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金管局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在該領域的風險管理措施。 考慮到倫敦銀行間隔夜拆息率（LIBOR）可能在年底後停止刊登，香港金管局提醒人工智能公司做好過渡至替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監察它們的準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖分子融資 (ML\/TF)\n\n金管局根據風險為基礎，對金融機構的洗錢及恐怖融資系統進行監察。本年，進行了18項現場審查及61項非現場檢討，包括針對私人銀行業務及新技術使用的監管進行主題性檢討。金管局向業界分享了從對金融機構應用風險為基礎的洗錢及恐怖融資控制措施，以協助中小企而進行的主題性檢討中備受關注的觀察及最佳實務，以便金融機構採用適當的開戶程序及為中小企提供服務的順序。\n\n# 金融行動工作群組（FATF）香港的互認評估報告\n\n香港金管局及香港的整體洗錢及恐怖融資防制制度在2019年的亮點，是金融行動小組（FATF）於9月發布有關香港的ME報告。該報告代表金融行動小組對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪ME評估中，至今最佳的整體結果之一。香港在對其洗錢及恐怖融資防制制度的成效評估中，獲得了11項“即時結果”中的六項“實質”評級，並且在ME的技術合規方面獲得了高標誌。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局以風險為基礎的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資監管方法給予良好評估，並指出香港金融管理局對銀行業的洗錢及恐怖分子融資風險有良好了解，並且對儲值設施（SVF）業的風險有合理了解。報告亦帶來支持銀行業的共同打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資努力，例如較大的人工智能（智能（人工智能））增加使用數據分析，以及大部分可疑交易報告均由人工（智能（人工智能））提交，以及該行業積極參與打擊訛騙及洗錢情報工作小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項範疇的改善，包括對一些高風險範疇的了解，例如海外貪污及稅務犯罪，以及培育如 SVF 等發展領域。已開始應對這些建議；香港金管局已於七月刊登修訂的洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估報告，並開始對私人銀行業務及新技術使用的監管進行主題現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last

把握因應內地金融市場開放而帶來嘅機遇，大量進展已作出，以推動粵港澳大灣區嘅金融合作，尤其喺 облегчение 香港居民跨界使用金融及銀行服務嘅領域。\n\n同時，大量努力已作出，以開放新機遇，進一步加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基礎設施投資和融資、綠色金融及私募股本基金。香港金融學院被設立，以提升香港的軟實力，並以可持續的方式進行。\n\n在中央銀行和監管機構社群中，香港金管局在多個區域性及國際性委員會中發揮領導作用，這對香港的專業知識和對國際工作承諾的明確認可。\n\n# 概述\n\n為加強香港在亞洲的金融科技樞紐地位，香港金融管理局投放巨大努力，實施七項智慧銀行先導計劃，這些計劃已於2017年9月公布，旨在促進金融科技在銀行和支付行業的發展和應用。這些先導計劃在該年內的進展包括：\n\n- 擴展轉數快的使用；\n- 促進銀行業第二階段開放API框架的落實；\n- 繼續提升金融科技研究和人才發展；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；授予8間虛擬銀行牌照；\n- 促進業界增加使用金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）2.0 推出金融科技倡議；以及\n- 繼續促進透過「銀行容易」倡議採用監管科技。\n\n香港金融管理局的金融科技促進辦公室（FFO），與香港金融管理局的銀行部門一同，發揮關鍵作用，推動這些舉措的落實。\n\n香港在全球投資者配置人民幣資產方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，透過股票互聯互通及債券通計劃，擁有對內地市場無與倫比的 접근性。 過去一年，債券通註冊投資者數目及每日成交額增長兩倍，可見其明顯效果。 為了進一步提升股票互聯互通及債券通，已引入了更多便利及靈活性，讓國際投資者更易於投資內地證券。 香港金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索及實施一系列金融促進措施，讓香港居民可全方位地使用廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）的金融及銀行服務，包括一項潛在的兩方式的財富管理互聯互通計劃。 香港保持著作為全球離岸人民幣業務中心堅定的立足點。 根據國際結算銀行（BIS）外匯（FX）及衍生產品市場成交額三年一次性調查，香港繼續是全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續的努力被投入到開創新機遇，以進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港基金業務的發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，提供更利的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金設立。舉辦了數目眾多的大型活動和針對性的外展活動，以推動香港作為綠色金融、基礎設施投資及融資以及企業財務中心（CTCs）的地位。為提升香港的軟實力，金融學院（Academy of Finance）（AoF）於6月設立，旨在制定金融領導力並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界，香港金管局在多個區域性和國際性委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金管局直至8月31日，一直是金融穩定理事會（FSB）的監管合作常設委員會（SRC）的主席。現時，香港金管局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的監管與落實工作小組（SIG）的主席，以及亞太區中央銀行行長會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。香港金管局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同主持金融穩定理事會（FSB）的非銀行監察專家小組（NMEG）。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的角色奠定了穩固的根基。 四個銀行間即時總額結算系統、中央結算及交收系統（CMU）及香港交易存儲庫（HKTR）於2019年取得100%系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。 透過與兩間中國內地中央證券存儲機構設立的帳戶，CMU協助進行在債券通北向交易下進行的交易結算，以及代表相關CMU會員持有中國內地債券證券。\n\nFPS，作為香港 dollar RTGS 系統的延伸，旨在使公眾可以即時向不同銀行及儲值機構進行零售基金轉帳及付款，全天候運作。在首個運作年，FPS 運作暢順。用戶對此設施的採用情況持續增加，正如登記數目達到四百萬，並在年底的交易量增長兩倍所顯示的一樣。FPS 為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全與效率，香港金管局已指定並監察總共六個零售支付系統（RPSs），受《支付系統及預付卡發牌條例》（PSSVFO）管轄。香港金管局亦於5月發出兩張新預付卡發牌，將總數的預付卡發牌數目增至18。預付卡發牌持有人們在該年繼續推出新產品及服務，積極多元化客戶選擇，提升用戶經驗。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 亞洲金融科技樞紐：香港\n\n# 智慧銀行方案\n\n香港金管局於2017年9月公布了七項智慧銀行業倡議，旨在協助銀行業**取得****更高**的**運作**水平，並把握銀行與科技匯聚所帶來的**龐大****機遇**。在該**年**，在**實施**這些倡議和轉型香港的金融科技生態系統方面**作出**了**大量**的**進展**。\n\n# 更快的支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出FPS，是香港在數位時代金融基礎設施發展的重大里程碑。FPS進一步推動香港的電子支付普及，向一般公眾和企業提供高效方便的支付服務。自FPS推出以來，參與服務提供者的數目已增加至30間銀行和11家SVF，截至2019年底，新增了九間銀行和一家SVF。\n\n轉數快的使用量亦穩定增長。截至2019年12月31日，轉數快記錄了首個四百萬登記數目（圖1），並處理了總額為港幣748.5億元及人民幣17億元的44百萬宗交易。12月，每日成交額達到168,000宗，價值港幣2.4億元及人民幣38百萬（圖2），相比其2018年10月首個十足運作每月，當時的交易宗數為51,000宗。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：\n-

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

的擔憂。全球股票市場在2018年 第4季 的 重大 調整 後 反彈，而主要政府債券收益率 下跌 ，債券價格上漲。在如此 利好 的環境下，金管局 記錄 了2,622 億 港幣的投資收入，相當於 6.6% 的投資回報。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n匯生銀行基金的目標，按照《匯生銀行基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。基金亦可運用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定與健全，幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局在財政司長的授權下，並在轉授的條款內，對匯生銀行基金的使用和投資管理負責於財政司長。\n\n# 基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（聯匯諮詢委員會）已為聯匯基金設立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎，在所有次，都十足支持著高度流動性的以美元計價資產；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n(d) 依照 (a)-(c)，取得一項投資回報，這將有助於保本基金的長線購買力。\n\n這些目標選持倉盤十足地考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置中。\n\n大致上，外匯基金擁有兩項重大投資組合：支持投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP 持有高度流動性的美元資產，以提供十足支持予貨幣基礎，並依照緊縮準備金安排的規定。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，以保本並維護其資產的長線實力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長線回報，香港金管局以審慎且循序漸進的方式，將部分投資基金的資產分散至更廣的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地的債券和股票在投資框架下進行，而私募股權和房地產投資則在長線增長投資組合（LTGP）下進行。長線增長投資組合（LTGP）下投資的市值上限，以投資基金累計盈餘的三分之一以及與長線增長投資組合掛鈎的未來基金及投資基金附屬機構的存款總和為上限。\n\n策略投資組合，於二零零七年**設立**，**持有**香港交易所及結算有限公司的**股份**，這些股份乃由政府為策略目的，以投資基金名義收購。由於其**獨特**性質，此投資組合未**包括**於基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 與匯生基金的投資安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率通常與IP表現掛鈎，重大例外情況是未來基金，其利率則參考投資組合配置，與IP和LTGP都有關。截至2019年底，未來基金在IP和LTGP之間的投資組合配置約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程支持著兩類資產配置的決定：戰略性資產配置和戰略性配置。戰略性資產配置，反映在投資標竿中，代表著聯匯基金投資目標所決定的長線資產配置。以...作指引，資產會戰略性地配置，以爭取在標竿之上取得額外回報。這表示實際配置往往與標竿（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏差」。雖然標竿和追蹤誤差上限由金融管理局諮詢聯匯基金顧問委員會決定，但選持倉盤的決定和戰略性偏差的可接受範圍由香港金管局在授權下作出設立。在戰略性偏差的可接受範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取 позиции，以利用短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於2018年8月設立了投資基金投資事務部（EFIO），以容納其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的會員直接管理匯生銀行約71%的投資，當中包括整個BP及IP的部分。這部分IP包括一系列投資於全球定息市場，並實施宏觀風險管理策略以供基金使用的各項衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 外部經理的使用\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局聘請外部基金經理管理約29日匯生基金的資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是爭取市場上可用的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，汲取多元且互補的投資風格，以及獲得他們在投資方面的市場洞察力和技術專業知識。\n\n使用外部管理人所產生的費用包括基金管理和託管費用、交易成本，以及預扣和其他稅款。這項支出主要由市場因素決定，並且可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜度日增，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部和外部管理的投資組合均已制定了嚴格的控制措施和投資指南，並且嚴格監察指南和法規的遵守情況。隨著投資環境的複雜度增加，風險評估已得到加強，以支持投資基金多元化的增長。風險控制工具被應用於評估正常和不利市場狀況下的市場風險。同時，亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以物色績效來源，支持香港金管局評估如何最佳地運用內部和外部經理人的投資技巧，提升其地位。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n金管局支持透過將環境、社會及管治 (環境、社會及管治) 因素併入聯交所公共及私人市場投資的投資過程中，促進負責任投資 (RI)。\n\n在公開市場投資方面，金管局實施與流程相關及與投資相關的措施。金管局採納的一項與流程相關的措施是採納《證券及期貨事務監察委員會》於2016年發布的《負責任股東行為準則》（PRO），這有助於投資者決定如何最佳地滿足他們在香港上市公司的投資相關責任。在管理投資基金時，金管局制定了關於環境、社會及管治因素的內部指南，涵蓋甄選、委任及監察外部基金經理的流程。金管局委任的外部基金經理，負責管理金管局的香港股票及內地活躍股票投資組合，需要恪守PRO，並以「遵守或解釋」為基礎管理投資，而委任管理金管局於已發展市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理，則需要恪守國際公認的環境、社會及管治標準。除了外部管理的基金外，環境、社會及管治因素亦被納入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信貸風險分析。\n\n關於公共市場的環境、社會及管治投資，香港金管局自2015年起作為該市場早於其他投資者之一，已投資綠色債券，並參與由國際金融公司主辦的「受管理聯合貸款投資組合計劃」，重點關注新興市場的永續投資。展望未來，香港金管局將繼續投資綠色債券組合，或透過投資綠色債券基金進行直接投資。香港金管局亦計劃在股本投資中構建以ESG為主題的投資組合，採納ESG股本指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用將ESG因素應用於其投資決定的主動股本經理。\n\n關於私募市場投資，香港金管局會將環境、社會及管治政策及實務納入盡職調查程序的一部分，以檢視普通合夥人。特別是，ESG 風險評估作為盡職調查的強制性部分，在所有長期股權投資中均會進行。對於長期股權投資，香港金管局會投資於具有可持續特點的項目；例如，自 2013 年起，香港金管局已直接及共同投資於能源領域，以及其房地產投資組合中的綠色建築和倉庫，這些建築和倉庫都具有綠色及可持續的特點。展望未來，香港金管局將繼續尋找具有可持續特點的項目，並將綠色認證作為房地產投資的重要方面。\n\n金管局將緊密監察環境、社會及管治標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入其投資流程。此流程由其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作所促進。特別是，作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則是全球領先的倡議平台，金管局預期將參與氣候相關的最佳實務制定，並鼓勵其他投資者採納負責任投資。此外，金管局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，這是一個非牟利組織，致力於透過工作坊及研究工作，鼓勵企業及投資決策的長遠重點。於2019年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n為更多關於香港金管局的責任投資政策框架的細則，請見企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟放緩和美中摩擦的擔憂，由於主要央行採取寬鬆貨幣政策，全球金融市場在2019年表現良好。隨着2018年第4季出現重大調整，全球股票市場在2019年反彈。在債券市場，主要政府債券收益率顯著下跌，而由於貨幣寬鬆，在2019年首個三季度債券價格上漲。儘管債券價格在第4季在收益率略為反彈的背景下回落，但2019年債券市場的整體收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場上，主要貨幣兌美元的表現各異。人民幣因美國與中國貿易摩擦的升溫，在第三季度下跌了3.8%，但在第四季度由於貿易緊張關係緩和，部分收復了較早前的損失。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。鎊因脫歐無協議風險增加，在第三季度下跌了3.2%，但自此反彈大幅，隨著第四季度脫歐局勢明朗化，最終兌美元增強了4.0%。\n\n二零一九年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現見表一。\n\n# 聯匯基金表現\n\n外匯基金於2019年記錄了2,622億金管局元投資收益。 其中包括債券收益1,145億金管局元、港股收益221億金管局元、其他股票收益1,007億金管局元、非港元資產的負匯兌換影響130億金管局元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資爭取了37.9億金管局元的收益。 另一方面，戰略投資組合記錄了2.5%的估值收益。\n\n聯邦儲備基金的總資產在年底達到金管局4,206.7億元。根據長期流動性激勵計劃的投資總值為335.1億元，其中私募股權為233.4億元，而房地產則為1,017億元。未償投資承諾達到219.3億元。\n\n聯匯基金 2019 年（不包括策略投資組合）的投資回報為 6.6%。具體而言，IP 取得 9.7% 的回報率，而 Bp 則增長了 2.5%。自 2009 年成立以來，長期投資組合已記錄到年化內部回報率為 12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

企業職能\n\n金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社會和市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。在機構內，作出努力以改善金管局的企業管治，支持員工的專業發展，訂立嚴格的財務紀律，提升資訊科技安全，並推動創新文化，應對因落實新倡議和工作複雜度增加而產生的挑戰。\n\n# 聘用社區\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金管局與媒體緊密合作，提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策和工作的了解。 過去一年，舉辦了125項開放新聞活動，其中包括10場會議、12場即場訪問及103項其他公開活動。 另外，安排了25場媒體訪問。 共發佈了466份雙語新聞稿，並每天處理大量的媒體查詢。\n\n為提高對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局舉辦了針對本地及海外媒體，以及社區內關鍵意見領袖的媒體簡報和教育工作坊，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為具有競爭力的國際金融中心等。\n\n自2018年7月起，香港金融管理局推出各項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育和溝通。現時有5個社交媒體渠道在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter和YouTube，截至2019年年底，已覆蓋超過45,000用戶。在2019年下半年社會事件之下，香港金融管理局利用社交媒體反駁有關銀行營運和金融穩定性的謠言，這項舉措證明了其高度有效性，有助於防止謠言散播。\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n公共查詢服務提供了一個有效的方式，讓公眾更好地了解金管局的主要職能和營運。 2019 年共處理了 9,742 宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策和法規、消費銀行以及紙幣和硬幣相關。 一些顯著的查詢涉及金幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引和通函、快速支付系統 (FpS) 以及貨幣和經濟統計。\n\n圖一顯示自2016年起所接獲的公共查詢數目，圖二提供2019年按查詢性質劃分的詳細說明。\n\n香港金管局執行總監於 Eddie Yue 先生，於香港銀行家團體傑出演講午宴上致辭。\n\n香港金管局執行總裁尤浩然（左），及時任香港金管局總裁陳德霖，於公布尤浩然獲委任為香港金管局之後總裁後，向媒體滿足。\n\n# 研究報告\n\n除了香港金管局年度報告外，2019年香港金管局刊登了兩期半年貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊，以及定期更新的月度統計通訊，以提供關於香港貨幣、銀行和經濟主題的新課題及分析。此外，香港金管局刊登了19篇inSight文章，涵蓋各項與其工作相關的主題。inSight文章提供了一個有用管道，讓香港金管局闡述其重大新倡議或政策的理由，並適時回應公眾感興趣的新課題。\n\n# 香港金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過4萬頁的內容，以英文、傳統及簡體中文呈現，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦包含根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的獲授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及獲授權機構的證券人員紀錄冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值易設施條例》維護的儲值易設施（SVF）牌照持有人的紀錄冊。金管局官方網站經歷一向的重大改進，並於9月推出新設計佈局、豐富的內容、加強的導航結構及更方便的搜尋功能。改進後的網站使用戶更容易、更方便地根據自己的偏好搜尋資訊。特別是，改進後的網站設有「明智消費者」的新版塊，公眾可以在此找到涵蓋廣泛的銀行及相關產品或服務的有用資訊及明智提示。這符合金管局一向的努力，以推動「明智及負責任」地使用銀行服務。\n\n金管局推出全新網站。\n\n翻新的香港金管局網站設有「智慧消費者」的新專區。\n\n香港金管局自2018年起，透過開放API（API）分階段刊登其網站上的金融數據及重要資訊。截至2019年，香港金管局已按照原定計劃，在香港金管局網站上開立130組技能。香港金管局鼓勵開放API的發展及應用。\n\n# 香港金融管理局資訊中心\n\n香港金管局位於國際金融中心兩號大樓55樓的資訊中心，是一個重要的資源，向社會大眾介紹金管局的 工作，並推動公眾對貨幣和銀行事務的 認識。它由一個展覽 領域和一個圖書館組成，開放六天。展覽 領域描述了金管局的 工作以及香港的貨幣和銀行發展。它 亦包含關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的研究 材料和展品。\n\n金管局在今年完成了其資訊中心最後一階段的翻新工程，即「歷史時間線」。翻新的歷史時間線主題為多媒體及數位顯示面板，讓訪問學者可以檢討香港及世界各地的重要貨幣和金融事件，以更互動的方式，並於10月重新開立給公眾參觀。\n\n歷史時間軸的第一部分由一個多媒體展示面板組成，介紹了1842年至1993年發生的重大事件。\n\n歷史時間軸的第二部分是一個數位展示面板，介紹了自1993年香港金融管理局設立以來，直至現在的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心舉辦以...作指引的導賞服務給訪問學者。在當年，接獲超過四萬八千名市民，並為學校和其他團體舉辦超過四百場以...作指引的導賞服務（圖3）。自開立以來，超過753,000人已參觀資訊中心，時間是12月2003年。\n\n以…作指引的導賞服務為學校和其他團體訪問學者舉辦。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽區，收錄超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他研究報告， 用於研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務以及中央銀行主題。它亦保持有關人工智能及本地代表機構的紀錄冊，以及根據《銀行條例》第20條規定的人工智能證券人員的紀錄冊。\n\n# 公共教育與消費者教育\n\n為向社會宣傳及提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局於一九九八年推出一項計劃，自此便舉辦了多個公眾教育研討會，邀請超過四○○名中學學生及教師參與。研討會的 主題 涵蓋了金管局的工作 介紹、香港的紙幣、 轉數快 、虛擬銀行發牌、金融科技及存款保障計劃。 至今已有超過六成 的教師及學生 參與了此計劃。\n\n來自不同區的中學學生和教師參加了2019年的公共教育研討會。\n\n香港金管局的消費者教育倡議活動的重點，在於教育公眾保護他們的“個人數字密碼”，這是一個引入的概念，旨在幫助公眾可視化保障資訊以使用其網上戶口的重要性。 核心訊息是，在數字全球，與網上銀行和其他數字金融服務相關的戶口登入細則和個人資訊，與保護自己住宅的鑰匙一樣重要，應得到良好保障。 為了強調保護個人數字密碼的智慧提示，在不同媒體上安排了廣泛的推廣，包括電視、收音機、手機應用程式、社交媒體以及其他數字和戶外平台。\n\n個人數位密鑰的重點活動透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行。\n\n持續推行舉措以教育公眾成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。例如，敦促會員保持警覺，注意冒充銀行打來的假電話，以及在社交媒體上宣傳的投資詐騙。亦發出關於處理個人信用產品的附註，特別是於報稅季節領取的個人貸款。\n\n為提升中學生理財知識，金管局與各項利益相關者合作，為期五年，舉辦了「香港通識教育理財知識錦標賽」。今年錦標賽全新運用了圖文並茂的資訊圖表，幫助學生更好地了解複雜的金融概念。一場網上測驗進行了，吸引了 10,450 份投稿，最終進入了於金管局舉行的首個總決賽。\n\n錦標賽，吸引了超過一萬份網上投稿，最終將以香港總商會的現場比賽作結。\n\n在當年，香港金管局展開了其跨世代聯繫教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃與一間教育機構聯合舉辦。計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲、家長研討會以及師資培訓工作坊，目標對象為幼稚園學生、他們的家長和教師，以及年青人。其他關於年青人教育的舉措包括與一間專業團體聯合製作漫畫故事書給小學學生和家長，以及向大專學生提供研討會。\n\n金管局一如既往地支持投資者及金融教育諮詢委員會，推動香港的金融知識普及化及能力提升，並將探索與不同持份者進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響。\n\n跨世代外展計劃第一階段的成就發布會，將與第二階段的推出一同舉辦。\n\n幼稚園學生參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書是由專業團體聯合製作，以利用智慧提示向學生及其家長宣傳銀行和金融服務。\n\n# 我們的市民\n\n雖然金管局是政府的其中一部分，但它聘請員工的條款與公務員不同，以吸引擁有相關經驗和專業知識的市民。金管局招聘、培養並保持一支高度專業的工作團隊，以支持其政策目標，並靈活地回應不斷變化的工作優先次序。\n\n香港金管局於2019年設立，編制為1,005個。 該年，香港金管局進行了一項跨部門的流程再造行動，以提升各項工作流程的效率，並重新調配現有資源以支持新舉措。 由於這項嚴格的行動，香港金管局2020年的整體編制保持不變，仍為1,005個。 資源已重新調配以承擔下列新任務：\n\n# 銀行及金融穩定性\n- 制定及實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準。\n- 提升針對保險中介人新監管制度的監管能力。\n- 加強持續監控銀行文化改革，並對銀行及其他提供信託服務的相關實體進行持續監管。\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資和風險管理以及其他必要的支持，以支持聯匯基金投資活動的進一步增長和多元化。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革，提升香港稅制在不同金融服務領域的競爭力，有關其國際競爭力。\n- 提升貿易倉儲數據的每日定性市場監察及分析。\n\n表一列出了香港金管局的設立和實力細節。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司長（FS）會根據交易基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及管治委員會（GSC）的意見，參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金管局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括合共現金方案及公積金計劃，實物福利基本。現金方案包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，可根據表現，每年以一次性總額頒發給個別會員。\n\n香港金管局員工薪酬每年由財政司司長’因應建議作出，這些建議由GSC透過eFAC提交，並參考GSC對香港金管局上一年表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查發現，以及其他相關因素。 為了獎勵個別表現卓越的會員，並維持其薪酬的競爭力，或會不時作出特別薪酬調整。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to

這種承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動可持續和環保的市場、支持更廣的社會、保護環境以及培育友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續的銀行業\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉和全球經濟永續發展的重大風險之一。銀行運作的金融業，作為社會的重要部分，亦將受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。香港金管局致力於探討應對這項挑戰的方法。在此背景下，香港金管局於5月公布了數目措施，以推動香港綠色金融的發展，包括採用三個階段的方法來推動綠色和永續性銀行業。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n作為聯匯基金的投資經理，香港金管局認為負責任投資（RI）的概念對其投資工作 具有高度相關性。 由於香港金管局是全球 最大資產擁有者之一，它將對基金經理選擇資產產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金管局視為RI是一種投資方法，在考慮各項環境、社會及管治 (環境、社會及管治) 因素對長線投資回報及可持續性影響。香港金管局認為，強調適當的RI及可持續的長線經濟表現，有助於取得投資基金的投資目標，並減少其底層投資中與環境、社會及管治相關事宜的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n鑒於金管局的指導原則是，長線風險調整後的回報相若，優先考慮環境、社會及管治投資。隨着時間推移，金管局在其投資過程中採用以下RI原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任的投資者’理念。\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金管局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析流程，以物色風險及機遇，因為它理念認為這些因素可能對其投資的長線價值產生影響。具體而言，香港金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入其公共市場及私營市場投資的投資過程。對於公共市場投資，香港金管局在其債券投資的信貸風險分析中納入環境、社會及管治因素。與香港金管局的責任投資理念分享的外部經理會被篩選並委任。香港金管局向所有外部經理傳達其責任投資理念，並預期他們配合，使整體可持續的長線經濟表現目標得以實現。對於私營市場投資，香港金管局會檢視其普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務，作為其盡職調查過程的一部分。\n\n# 主動擁有\n\n金管局以一種方式行使於其公共股權持有中的股東權利，以幫助保障其投資的長線價值。金管局相信，以環境、社會及管治因素作指引的負責任的企業行為將有助於長期創造股東價值。金管局的資產經理預期將幫助金管局在相關投資中履行其所有權責任，透過行使投票權及與企業關切，採納積極的股東參與方式。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金管局致力攜手理念相近的投資者和監管機構，推動投資管理方面的良好長線 практики。它參與並在公開活動上發表演講，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用企業社會責任。\n\n請參考儲備資產管理章節，以了解香港金管局在年內就風險投資所進行的工作的細則。\n\n#

推動金融知識普及\n\n香港金管局透過各項途徑推動金融知識普及。除了運作教育計劃，推動公眾明智且負責任地運用銀行及金融服務外，香港金管局在其改進的官方網站上設有全新的「精明消費者」專區，公眾可以在此發現涵蓋廣泛的銀行及相關產品和服務的有用資訊及貼士。除了香港金管局官方網站和研究報告外，Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等媒體平台也被運用，以提供最新的銀行及金融事務資訊。\n\n香港金管局資訊中心，自2003年起作為金管局的主要公眾教育及研究資源，向社會介紹金管局的工作，並推動大眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。教育以…作指引的導賞服務每日提供給來自學校及非牟利機構的訪問學者。此外，亦為學生舉辦公眾教育研討會及其他活動，以提升他們的財務知識及素養。此外，金管局亦與投資者及金融教育議會緊密合作，透過其金融教育平台「陳氏宗祠」，推動香港的金融知識。\n\n請參閱企業職能章節，以了解更多關於香港金管局在該年推動金融知識普及化的工作細則。請參閱銀行穩定性章節，以了解更多關於香港金管局在該年推動金融普惠性的工作細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體的需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可達性\n\n2018年鈔票系列延續上一系列的特點，運用了設計，以幫助視障人士區分不同面額。這些設計包括盲文、觸感線條和高觸感的數字。\n\n為 幫助 視障人士 區分 鈔票 的 面額，一款 手機 應用程式，現時 由 香港 金融 管理 局 贊助，並 由 香港 盲人 協會 引入，利用 手機 相機 掃描 鈔票 的 圖案 以 識別 面額。該 應用程式 可 從

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）第187頁至293頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2019年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該年終止日止的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附注，其中包含重大的會計政策概要。\n\n在我看來，財務報表真實且公允地反映了截至2019年12月31日基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及截至該年終止日止的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則 (“HKFRSs”) 作出準備，且已根據《交易基金條例》(第66章) 第7日ئيس行政長的指示作出準備。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據《交易基金條例》第7日及審計總署的審計準則，作出執行審計。根據該等準則，我的責任在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步說明。我獨立於該集團，並根據該等準則履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計憑證足夠且適當，為我的意見作出依據。\n\n# 審核重點\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，在我專業判斷下，於截至2019年12月31日止**年**度，我對財務報表審核中最重要的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表**整體**審核的**背景**下討論的，並且在形成我的意見時考慮到，我不會就這些事項**提供**單獨的意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債之公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5%、2.6和38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總值為3,874,223百萬港元，金融負債總值為1,158,686百萬港元，按公允價值計算。\n\n對於這 91% 的金融資產和所有金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入），或利用估值技術，並根據可觀察市場數據估算（第二層輸入）。\n\n對於這批金融資產剩餘的9%，其公允價值乃利用估值技術估計，而這些估值技術的輸入並非基於可觀察的市場數據（第三級輸入）。此批金融資產總計金管局338,758百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於涉及的數量龐大且估計繁複，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債乃為關鍵審核事項。\n\n審核程序包括對以公允價值評估之金融資產及金融負債的程序。\n\n了解評估不同類別的金融資產和金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施。\n\n評估和測試控制，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制。\n\n就資產及負債之評估、存在、權利義務及完整性，取得外部確認。\n\n若有引用市場價格，則需驗證該價格與獨立來源是否一致。\n\n其中，對於以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術運用，評估估值方法之適合性以及假設之合理性，並核實輸入數據來源是否獨立；且\n\n在運用未以可觀察市場數據為根據的估值技術時，評估估值方法是否適合，以及假設和輸入的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業按公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.11、18 和 19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日總額為金管局22,481百萬港元。集團亦持有兩間合營企業的權益，總額為44,506百萬港元，其主要業務是持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合營企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值所決定。此等估值涉及重大判斷和估計，包括估值方法及運用之假設。\n\n審核以公允價值評估投資房地產的程序包括：\n\n獲取並審閱集團直接或透過合資企業所持投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值是否根據估值報告中列示的估值進行。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性和資歷；以及\n\n評估估值方法之適合性，以及假設及輸入之合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n當局負責其他資訊。該等其他資訊包括香港金管局二零一九年年報內的所有資訊，但除財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告外，不包含其他內容。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我不對此類資訊表達任何形式的結果。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式出現重大失實。 根據我所表現的工作，如果我認為該其他資訊存在重大失實，我規定需要報告這個事實。 在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的。\n\n# 金融管理局及聯繫基金諮詢委員會審核委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n當局負責作出符合香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務匯報準則及行政長官根據《流通資金條例》第7日發出的指示的財務報表的準備，並就當局認為有必要，以使財務報表免受因訛騙或錯誤而產生的重大錯誤陳述，而設立適當的內部監控。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團作為一間持續經營企業的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，同時利用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會的審計小組負責監察集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人審核財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，無論財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯報，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，並發行一份包括我意見的審計報告。合理確信是一種高程度的確信，但並非保證，即使按照審計委員會的審計標準進行，審計也可能無法一直發現已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能帶來因訛騙或錯誤而產生，並且如果單獨或總計來看，合理地預期會影響基於這些財務報表的用戶所做的決定，則被視為重大。\n\n作為審計準則審計的其中一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n物色並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以提供意見的依據。因訛騙而未發現重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤而未發現的風險，因為訛騙可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上。\n\n為取得與審計相關的內部控制了解，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但非為表達對集團內部控制成效的意見。\n\n評估會計政策的適合性以及當局作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性。\n\n就當局使用持續經營會計基礎的適合性做出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能造成對集團持續經營能力的重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的不確定性。如果我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我規定需要在我的審計報告中關注財務報表中的相關披露，如果這些披露不足，則需要修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我的審計報告日取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來事件或情況可能造成集團無法繼續持續經營；\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、架構與內容，包括相關的披露事項，以及財務報表是否以一種方式錄得反映了相關交易和事件，以達成公允表達；並且就集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息，取得足夠的適當審計憑證，以對財務報表表示意見。我對集團審計的方向、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任，並將其維持。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組聯繫，當中包括審計的範圍和時間安排，以及重大發現，包括我在審計過程中物色到的任何重大內部監控不足之處。\n\n我亦向聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組提供一份報告，聲明我已遵守有關獨立性的道德要求，並與他們聯繫所有可能被認為與我的獨立性相關的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與聯絡基金諮詢委員會審計小委員會有溝通的事項中，我決定了在審計本現行期間的財務報表時，最為重要的關鍵審計事項。我將在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我決定不應在我的報告中溝通該事項，因為這樣做的不利後果將會合理地被認為超過了公開溝通的公共利益福利。\n\n卓
