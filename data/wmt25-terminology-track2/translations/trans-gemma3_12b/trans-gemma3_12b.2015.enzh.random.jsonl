{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年經歷了增長放緩，反映了本地需求轉弱以及出口表現欠佳。 預計2016年的經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部逆風和脆弱的金融市場情況下保持緩和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港的經濟增長在當年放緩，實際本地生產總值（本地生產總值）的增長放緩至 2.4%，較 2014 年的 2.6% 為低 (表 1)。這反映了國內需求溫和的擴大，儘管淨出口回軟成為本地生產總值增長的貢獻者，因為總進口比總出口更快下跌 (圖 1)。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞工市場大致處於穩定狀態，失業率維持在約 3.3% 的低位。由於國內成本和進口價格壓力消退，通脹進一步回軟。本地股票價格在 глобальных 金融市場波動加劇下出現大幅上落。住宅物業市場在 2 月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始回軟，房屋價格顯示出朝向年底的鞏固跡象。\n\n圖一 本地生產總值增長及貢獻\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n表 1 實際 本地生產總值 增長，按支出構成劃分 (期間比較)\n\n經季節因素調整的季對季毛國內固定資本形成率變動數據，目前不可得。資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015 年匯率穩定，香港港元匯率維持在對美國港元的 7.75 水平附近。由於與股票相關的流入，強方可兌換保證在 4 月被觸發，又在 9月和 10 月反映了離岸人民幣的拆倉以及一些對港元的商業需求。隨著總體結餘擴大，本地利率繼續維持低水平，而香港金管局基礎利率在 12月中美國際利率上調後，從 0.5% 上調至 0.75%。由於信貸需求疲軟，銀行業的貸款總體增長進一步放緩至 2015 年的 3.5%，而 2014 年為 12.7%。銀行業的整體貸款質素輕微削弱，但不良貸款比率仍然維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n2015年國內需求增長步伐放緩。然而，儘管就業和收入情況大致穩定並繼續提供支持，但消費者信心轉弱以及資產價格的調整拖累了私人消費增長，尤其是在下半年。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長勢頭，全年的私人消費增長從2014年的3.3%增加到4.8%。政府消費亦以輕微加快的速度增加3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩的主要原因是國內固定資本形成下跌22%。私人部門的機器設備採購連續第二年出現萎縮，同時建築和施工活動也伴隨著公共項目進度放緩，展現出轉弱的增長勢頭。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現下在2015年轉差（圖3）。商品出口錄得廣泛基於的1.7%下跌，是自2009年以來首輪。對日本和歐洲聯盟的出口下跌，而對美國的出口錄得輕微增長。來自這些先進市場的呆滯的最終需求亦拖累了區域工業活動和區域內貿易。結果，香港對中國大陸、新加坡、南韓和台灣的出口也下在轉弱的中間和最終需求下而下跌。香港的服務出口繼續溫和地從早前的高增長軌道調整，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的下跌，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。商品進口也隨著本地和出口引發的需求轉弱而下跌。相反，由於本地居民強烈的旅遊興趣，服務進口增長加快。整體而言，淨貿易盈餘在2015年優化輕微，對本地生產總值增長提供了一個正數的貢獻。\n\n圖 2 國內需求\n資料來源：部門。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n潛在通脹於2015年下由於溫和的本地成本壓力及進口價格通脹回軟，進一步減退。撇除政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應後，潛在通脹率從2014年的3.5%下降至2.5%（圖4）。 由於經濟活動欠佳，勞工成本壓力仍然平穩，而商業及工業租金成本壓力則有所放緩，尤其是在上半年。 由於全球商品價格回軟以及港幣的強勁，進口價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦維持低水平。 由於早前季度的新訂房屋租金的影響較輕微，通脹中的租金成分受到遏抑。\n\n圖3 貨物及服務出口\n資料來源： Census and Statistics 部門。\n\n圖4 隱藏的消費者物價膨脹\n資料來源： Census and Statistics 部門。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2015年就業情況仍然穩定。勞動力需求大致維持，儘管貿易和旅遊相關行業的就業下跌，但其他商業領域的招聘步伐穩定抵銷了此影響，因此總就業人數增加 1.3%，對比早前一年。鑑於勞動力供應亦上升 1.3%，經季節因素調整的失業率平穩維持在約 3.3% 全年 (圖 5)。 鑑於仍然偏緊的勞動力市場，名義勞工收入在該年的首三季度上升 4.7%，對比 2014 年的 4.3%。 由於通脹壓力減緩，實際勞工收入在該年的首三季度增加 1.3%，對比 2014 年的下跌 0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本港股市因外部環境劇變而經歷一年的波動。首輪季，市場表現平淡，然而在內地A股市場的牛市情緒及資金流入下，第二季本地股市顯著回升。恒生指數於4月飆升至七年高，這是自2014年11月起步以來，滬港通每日額度首次被耗盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地市場出現逆轉，恒生指數下傳28%，於9月跌至一年低位，這下受內地A股市場及全球股市的拋售、全球外匯市場的波動加劇以及國際商品價格疲軟的影響。在環球及內地金融市場回穩下，本港股市在最後一季有所回升。整體而言，2015年恒生指數錄得7.2%的下跌，為自2011年以來最差的表現，而平均每日成交額從2014年的69.5億港元增加至1,115.6億港元。儘管集資活動在 上半年放緩，但從本地股市籌集到的整體股本資金增加至942.7億港元，較一年前激增。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整合跡象。 早前在 2015 年初經歷一段暢旺的期間，住宅物業市場在 2 月公布了首輪謹慎措施後回軟。 儘管房屋價格上升步伐放緩，在最後一季下跌，2015 年的房屋價格累計上升為 2.5%，低於 2014 年的 13.5% 上升幅度（圖 6）。 期間，交易量較去年同期下跌 12.3%，降至 55,982 宗，而二手市場的交易活動明顯下跌。 包括確認人交易和短期倒手交易在內的投機性交易，仍然維持低水平。 儘管如此，家庭可負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格收入比率達到 15.7，而收入負擔比率遠高於其長期平均水平。 商業和工業物業市場在 上半年暢旺，但其後交易活動回軟，在最後一季，價格和租金都錄得下跌。 租金回報率大致維持與早前一年的相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖6

本地，私人消費預期將適度增長，因為勞工市場情況很可能面臨一些壓力，下疲弱的經濟上升，以及本地資產價格的調整可能損害消費者信心並引起負面效應。 建築及地盤工程的項目可繼續，但疲弱的商譽和利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n通脹壓力預期會保持受到遏抑。進口價格壓力 вероятно會維持緩和，而本地成本壓力預期在溫和經濟增長勢頭下會是溫和的。通脹的租金成分可因應 2015 年底新訂房屋租金壓力減弱。市場共識預期標題通脹率在 2016 年為 2.5%，而政府 прогнозирует 基本通脹率為 2.0%。勞工市場亦可稍為回軟，原因是訪客數量減少和出口部門繼續低迷。 私營機構分析師現在預期失業率將上升至 3.5% 在 2016 年。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n儘管過去幾年已設立了逆周期宏觀審慎措施和其他監管措施，顯著增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。2016 年的經濟展望會面對數目不明朗因素和風險。特別是，美國利率進一步上升的步伐、全球增長展望和商品價格走勢將繼續是主要的資料來源。任何顯著的不利發展都可加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動，從而收窄本地貨幣和金融情況，並對香港的增長展望投下陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟產生的效應很大程度取決於它們對物業市場的影響，透過財富和資產負債表效應。雖然物業市場正面對日益的下行風險，這些風險來自全球和本地金融市場的轉弱，美國利率正常化，以及房屋供需差距的收窄，但仍需更多時間來判斷物業市場是否已進入下行周期。\n\n# 金融業表現\n\n香港銀行業在該年仍然穩健，儘管先進經濟體貨幣政策出現進一步分歧，並且新興市場經濟體中風險與不穩定因素持續累積。認可機構的流動性狀況繼續良好，而本地註冊的認可機構資本充裕。零售銀行資產品質輕微轉差，但維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國美元利率，香港 dollar

盈利走勢\n\n銀行業的盈利能力在2015年放緩。零售銀行在香港的辦事處總體課稅前經營利潤下跌28%，儘管手續費及佣金收入（上升9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具經營收入（上升22.4%）以及淨利息收入（上升1.3%）有所增加，但卻被營運費用增加8.8%和貸款減損準備增加76%所抵銷。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤增加14.7%，主要歸功於出售策略性投資的收益。零售銀行平均資產的稅後回報率優化至2014年的0.99%至1.05%（圖8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

貨幣穩定性\n\n港幣匯率在 2015 年儘管金融市場動盪，以及 12 月美國利率上升，仍然大致保持穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，擁有充裕的銀行間流動性。作為過去幾十年香港貨幣及金融穩定 的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續對外部衝擊保持穩健。\n\n# 目標\n\n本港貨幣政策的主要目的是貨幣穩定。這被定義為本港貨幣在對外匯率市場中，相對於美國圓的匯率在區間 港幣7.75 - 7.85 元兌一美元之間保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構特點是金管局安排，規定貨幣基礎至少要由美國圓儲備金百分之一百百覆蓋，並且貨幣基礎的變動要與美國圓儲備金的相應變動配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括\n\n負債證明書，十足地支持由3家票據發行銀行發行的紙鈔。\n政府發行的硬幣和流通金額。\n總體餘額，是銀行在香港金管局保留的清算賬戶餘額的總額。\n香港金管局代表政府發行的票據和紙鈔。\n\n本港港元匯率的穩定，乃透過自動利率調整機制以及本港金管局對兌換保證（CUs）的承諾得以維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至港幣兌一美元的7.75強方CU時，本港金管局將準備好向銀行出售港元，以換取美元。總體結餘將擴大，推高港元利率，創造一項將港元由強方限位由…回復到7.75至7.85之間換算區的貨幣情況。相反，如果港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率轉弱至港幣兌一美元的7.85弱方CU時，本港金管局將向銀行買入港元。總體結餘將隨之收縮，推動港元利率上升，將港元由弱方限位維持於7.75至7.85之間換算區。\n\n負債證明書以及政府發行並流通金額的紙幣和硬幣，載於此處，以港元計面值。此年度報告中，會計基金資產負債表上相應的項目，是等值於美國數額，並須要按照資產負債表日現行匯率進行兌換的港元。此安排根據香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n此處的EFBN金額與本年報中香港金融管理局結餘表中的金額不同。 根據香港一般公認的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表香港金融管理局在二手市場交易EFBN而持有的EFBN，將會抵銷已發行的EFBN，並將淨金額錄得於結餘表。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n香港法定匯率在2015年大致保持穩定，在7.7500至7.7657的窄幅區間內波動，兌換美國的美元（圖1）。2015年上半年，香港法定匯率在市場對美國利率上升的憂慮下，面臨輕微轉弱的壓力。然而，在第二季，香港法定匯率對美國的美元貼近7.75，由於股市活動暢旺，主要在4 月多次被觸發兌換保證，特別是與股票相關的對香港法定匯率的需求急升。踏入下半年，香港法定匯率繼續在8 月份對美國的美元貼近7.75波動，儘管香港和內地的股票市場出現顯著的拋售，以及全球貨幣市場的波動增加（包括人民幣）。由於離岸人民幣向香港法定匯率的拆倉，兌換保證在9月和10月再次被觸發。儘管聯邦公開市場委員會（FoMC）在12月中將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，香港法定匯率仍於美國的美元之間保持在緊密區間內，沒有明顯的流出壓力。整體而言，香港法定匯率市場在全年的情況下，儘管全球金融市場動盪，仍然有序運作。\n\n圖一 二零一五年市場匯率\n\n隨著強方位的兌換保證多次於4月、9月和10月被觸發，金管局被動地從銀行購入總共293億美元，並以2,272億本港元進行交換，根據貨幣發行制度的原則。這導致總體結餘相應擴大，部分擴大被增發的票據抵銷，以回應銀行對流動性管理強烈的需求（圖2）。增發的交換基金票據符合貨幣發行制度的原則，因為它顯示了貨幣基礎的組成變化，而貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。截至2015年底，總體結餘與未償還的交換基金票據和票息的總額從早前一年的9,925億本港元增加至12,210億本港元。\n\n圖2 總體結餘及2015年金管局未償還債務\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n憑藉本港銀行體系充裕的流動性，香港銀行同業拆息利率全年在2015年保持低位。隨著美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）根據既定公式從0–0.25%上調至0.25至0.5%，基準利率亦於12月17日根據既定公式上調至0.75%。就2015年整體而言，隔夜至三個月期銀行同業拆息利率均低於基準利率（圖3），受到銀行季節性流動性需要及8月份波動的金融市場情況下收緊的流動性所驅動，呈現輕微波動。大致追蹤香港銀行同業拆息（HiBoR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（liBoR）的差距，香港 dollar遠期點數在8月份因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著溢價，其後由於美元利率的廣泛增加，在年底因應市場情況而轉為折讓（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常 функционировать。貼現窗借款並未活躍，在2015年僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年香港銀行同業利率\n\n圖 4 2015 年香港 долла forward points\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自 1983 年成立以來，聯匯制度繼續暢順地運作，並顯著促進了香港過去幾十年來貨幣和金融穩定。鑑於香港的小型開放經濟以及其作為國際金融樞紐的角色，聯匯制度維持對香港來說是最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅決承諾維持聯匯制度。事實上，外匯和貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的公信力，公眾繼續對港幣作為支付手段和保值方式抱有強信心。在 2015 年與香港的第四次諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織 (IMF) 繼續推動聯匯制度，認為其是香港的最佳安排，並引用香港健全的體制、法律和政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及良好的金融系統作為推動聯匯制度暢順運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金管局繼續密切監察銀行信貸、流動性和利率風險的管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強了對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監察工作，以優化銀行業的韌性。 鑒於美國利率上升，香港金管局提醒公眾在管理風險時作出必要準備，並指出任何觸發弱勢方面兌換保證以及港元流出，都是香港港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為改善貨幣基金賬戶的透明度，自10月1998年起，已將貨幣基金資產的特定部分提供給支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2015年期間在106.3至107.5%的窄範圍內上落，而沒有觸及上或下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日為106.3%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定特定貨幣基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有貨幣基金資產均可得於支持港元匯率。該基金龐大的金融資源提供了一道強力後盾，以保護香港的貨幣和金融穩定，應對突如其來的衝擊。\n\n圖5 2015年支持比率的每日變化。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行局諮詢委員會監察並審閱香港貨幣及金融穩定性方面的事宜。 於2015年，該委員會考慮了包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應、宏觀審慎措施的國際使用、美國利率上升對香港物業市場的影響，以及基准利率的釐定公式、香港法定實值匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的國家風險。該委員會討論的記錄以及提交給委員會的貨幣發行局運作的報告，均載於香港金管局網站的為。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

銀行穩定性\n\n金管局將其監管工作重點放在持牌金融機構的風險管治上，包括信貸及流動資金風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資的控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售手法。 隨著系統性風險的積累，金管局宣布香港從2016年1月起實施0.625%的議息資本緩衝，並於2017年1月起實施1.25%。 5間持牌金融機構被指定為國內系統重要性銀行，將會面對較高的損失吸收資本緩衝。 在復甦及解決方案的改革方面取得了顯著進度，透過將《金融機構（解決）條例》草案提交立法會。 金管局亦加強了與銀行業的合作，以加強基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融從業員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015 回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n下跡象顯示主要已開發經濟體之間在貨幣政策路向出現分歧，新興市場在2015年面臨更高的資本外流和更緩慢的經濟增長風險。為維持銀行業在可能出現宏觀經濟環境突然惡化情況下的韌性，香港金管局繼續密切監察認可機構的風險管治成效及其信用和流動資金風險管理系統。\n\n# 營運監督\n\n於2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採納以定期現場審核輔以增加數目的主題審查的監管方法。主題審查是針對認可機構的部分特定範疇或活動進行的深度離地審查。此方法容許香港金融管理局將其監管資源的重點放在認可機構出現的新興及更重要的風險上。\n\n在該年，香港金管局共進行了193項現場審查。鑑於認可機構貸款組合資產品質出現惡化的跡象，進行了更深入的主題性現場審查，內容涵蓋信貸風險管理和資產品質。下市場不確定性的影響，香港金管局亦增加了解決與庫房相關活動的審查數目，基於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策的分歧。現場審查亦進行了與內地相關業務、壓力測試和流動性風險管理、營運和科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢和打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制以及認可機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型。認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險和強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，在該年亦由專業小組進行了現場審查。\n\n此外，總共有152場主題性離線審查進行，涵蓋與主題性現場審查相似的範疇。表1包含營運監督工作的詳情。\n\n在 2015 年，進行了 196 項離地盤審查，以評估 認可機構 的公司治理、財務狀況和業務運作。監管部門的關注集中在風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及推行 巴塞爾三 標準的監控上。監管小組與 部分 認可機構的董事會和外部審計師保持了頻繁聯繫。舉行了 20 次與 認可機構 高級管理層和外部審計師的三方會議，同時與 部分 認可機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了 23 日 的會議。\n\n銀行監管審查委員會考慮了4個案，均與認可機構的授權有關。\n\n為更好地利用其監管資源來處理競爭 приоритеты，香港金管局繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條賦予的權力，要求認可機構委任外部審計師跟進潛在重大監管問題。香港金管局於2015年根據該條文委任了6份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋洗錢及恐怖融資管制，另外兩份報告涵蓋私人銀行業務，餘下報告則與範疇包括證券相關活動和貸款分類系統有關。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n沒有任何認可機構違反了《銀行條例》於2015年關於資本充足率或流動性比率的要求。雖然在《銀行條例》的各種條文中出現了84宗違規行為，但均未影響存款人的利益，並且已由認可機構迅速糾正。\n\n表 1 營運監督\n\n# 根據《銀行條例》第52條賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 仍然會面對權限根據《銀行條例》第52條的行使。認可機構於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條就Melli Bank Plc香港分行的事務、業務及財產施加的指示，在該年內仍然有效。香港金管局將繼續與有關權限定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總部相關的發展，並將密切關注為保護認可機構存款人的利益而採取的監察措施。\n\n# CAMEL 評級審查\n\n審查委員會檢討了AIs的綜合CAMEL評級，並制定了相關規定。AIs已獲通知其評級，並有機會要求檢討。在該年內，沒有收到任何檢討要求。\n\n# 專業監督工作\n\n# 營運與科技風險的監督\n\n金管局鑒於新興風險及行業發展，繼續簽發有關營運及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。 尤其，金管局完成《監察政策手冊》(SPM) 模組的修訂，以涉及電子銀行 (e-banking)，容許認可機構在提供新e-banking服務方面有更大的彈性。 此外，金管局亦發行有關網絡安全的通函，重申認可機構的董事會及高級管理層對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監察的重要性。 金管局亦定期發行《營運事故監察》報告，重點介紹部分欺詐個案或營運事故的作案手法及識別出的監控漏洞。\n\n金管局進行基於風險的專題現場及離場監察，以評估部分認可機構在企業層面或特定業務範圍內的操作風險及科技風險管理。 這些涵蓋了部分與認可機構操作風險管理框架、網絡安全風險管理、防止異常交易活動的控制、對重要外包服務供應商的監察、欺詐風險管理及反洗錢科技控制有關的範疇。 這些監察工作輔以年度獨立合規審核，涵蓋操作風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶數據保護）及業務持續性計劃，部分認可機構須要委任獨立且具資歷的評核員，以審查其有關控制的 adequateness，然後糾正識別出的弱點。 金管局亦分析了認可機構的操作風險及科技風險的趨勢及重點監察範疇，特別是那些在香港貨幣及銀行系統的穩定及有效運作中扮演重要角色的認可機構。\n\n金管局監察銀行業芯片式自動櫃員機技術推行 的最終階段，認可機構已於年底完成純信用卡的換卡程序。金管局亦須要認可機構落實認證控制，以進一步改善“離線”信用卡的安全性。 另一方面，在收取到部分感應式信用卡儲存的持卡人姓名可被秘密存取 的呈報後，金管局要求相關認可機構迅速採取行動，通知並保護受影響 的持卡人。 金管局投放資源公佈並闡釋事件 的規模及影響，以解決公眾 的關注，並監察認可機構 的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響 的卡。\n\n金管局與業界及其他持份者協作推行多項措施，包括公眾意識提升電子銀行安全防範計劃、設立網絡安全情報分享平台，以及為香港金融服務業務持續管理論壇舉辦的一場危機管理演習提供支持及建議，該演習涉及認可機構及其他金融公司。\n\n# 審視財富管理及公積金相關業務\n\n金管局與香港其他金融監管機構密切合作，就認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引並進行監察。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管局的贊助下，定期維持與監管機構的聯繫。這些會議涵蓋了涉及金融機構或在不同金融服務行業領域擁有密切業務關係的受規管實體的多種問題，以確保更協調和有效的監管行動。\n\n在一年內，金管局**進行**了 25 項現場及離地主題審查，以及 15 項對**認可機構**的離地監察。 這些**涵蓋**了投資產品的銷售、處理證券交易的結算以及客戶證券的**安全**保管，以及向零售、私人銀行和企業銀行客戶銷售非連結長期保險 (NLTI) 產品和 MPF 相關產品，**涉及**到此。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局向認可機構發行通函，就向客戶銷售非本地投資產品的合適度評估及產品資料披露提供指引。此指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括7 月由保險監管處及香港保險從業員聯會發行的有關要求。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局繼續與金融服務及財富管理局（FSTB）在《保險公司（修訂）條例》2014年的立法過程中密切合作，以設立獨立的保險監察專員處及為保險中介人設立法定牌照制度。 7 月，立法會通過了《保險公司（修訂）條例》2015，當中包括賦予金管局透過授權，就認可機構的保險中介人活動，進行檢查及調查的權限。\n\n金管局已處理了6宗成為註冊機構（RI）的申請，以及一宗RI從事增發的受規管活動的申請。它授予了204名負責監察RI證券活動的負責人員同意，並對RI向金管局提交以供其維持的登記冊納入資料的9,697名人士進行了背景審查。\n\n# 庫務監督\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理仍然是香港金管局的首要監察重點，尤其鑑於預期美國利率正常化以及隨後資金流動潛在逆轉可能對認可機構的流動性狀況造成影響。全2015年，香港金管局繼續推行加強的穩定資金需求，以維持充足的穩定資金，支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起落實《巴塞爾三》流動性覆蓋比率（lCRs）以來，香港金管局一直監察一類機構的lCRs水平和趨勢，這些機構普遍維持的流動性覆蓋比率貼近或高於百分之一百，遠高於2015年逐步實施安排下的法定最低60%。\n\n另一方面，金管局對部分認可機構的風險管理控制框架進行了現場審查，以應對預期的利率正常化。下市場波動的影響，金管局亦密切關注突然的市場變化及其對銀行業以及個別認可機構的影響，並採取了適當的後續行動。\n\n# 主管主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n金管局繼續進行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試項目，以更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端和不利經濟情況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。在過去的一年，為了收集更詳細的信息，以更深入了解所選範疇的風險動態，提交了多項優化措施。金管局分析了參與認可機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步優化其壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信貸風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n過去幾年觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年上半年開始有所消退。總體而言，當年銀行業的總貸款增加3.5%，對比2014年的12.7% (表2)。由於客戶存款的增長速度加快於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率在2015年底降至72.2%的70.1%，與一年前相比。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

國際金融中心\n\n二零一五年，全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，促使國際社會加強合作與溝通，以維持穩定。 該年，香港金管局繼續積極參與國際和地區會議，不遺餘力地加強香港作為國際金融中心 的競爭力，包括加強我們的金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，並利用人民幣國際化進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。 香港強勁的經濟基本面和穩健的財政表現，繼續受到信用評級機構的認可，標準的評級維持對香港的頂級三A評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金管局積極參與關於對全球和區域金融穩定具有重要意義的議題的國際討論。7 月，其承擔了亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢組 (FSB RCG(A)) 的聯合主席職位，為期兩年。該組的目標是促進 FSB 成員和非成員之間的互動，鼓勵推行金融改革，並增進對金融穩定問題的意見交流。香港金管局繼續與東盟+3 國的相關部門密切工作，強化東盟+3 宏觀經濟研究辦公室 (AMRO) 的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監察和分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化 (CMIM) 的決定令。\n\n在該年，香港的離岸人民幣池和債券發行受到數目市場因素的收縮。然而市場繼續有序地進行，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款和外匯交易維持了穩定增長。此外，香港境內及通過香港進行的日益擴大的人民幣業務促進了國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）對人民幣的肯定，將其視為可自由使用的貨幣。國際貨幣基金組織的決定包括將其納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將帶動人民幣國際化的進程，以及香港離岸市場的進一步發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全和效率運作，以及其持續發展，在鞏固香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的優勢方面扮演著重要角色。 2015 年，香港的人民幣支付系統交易量創下新高，而場外衍生產品交易集中報平台繼續支持機構按照新場外衍生產品市場監管制度的須要提交其場外衍生產品交易。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施在2015年得到香港金管局進一步優化，新增了組件和服務，包括12月成功推出電子支票服務，意思是超過150間銀行現在可透過互聯網和流動渠道收取並處理客戶的電子支票。電子帳單及繳費（EBPP）服務，於2013年推出後，在2015年繼續看到商戶參與良好增長。7月，中央結算系統（CMU）推出一項其資金指令轉駁服務下的服務，以支持推行內地與香港互認基金（MRF）。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架在11月啟動《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（pSSVFo）後得到改善。根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》，香港金管局獲授權落實多用途儲值支付工具的強制牌照制度，並履行有關監察及執行職能，以及指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及效率的運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015 回顧\n\n# 國際和區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫增加，香港金管局積極與其他地區合作，通過國際和區域會議，包括金融穩定委員會、國際結算銀行及亞太經濟合作組織，以助發展可持續的經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金管局亦繼續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團的建議，以應付強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n金管局於7月成為FSB RCG(A)的共同主席，並於10月在香港舉辦了其第九次會議。RCG(A)作為FSB成員和非成員互動及合作金融穩定問題的重要平台。來自16個亞洲地區的財政部、中央銀行和金融監管機構的高級代表參加了會議，討論了該地區面臨的挑戰、日益增加的資產管理活動的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。金管局亦於8月在香港共同主辦了一場關於宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會由全球金融系統委員會（CGFS）舉辦，並有來自世界各地的18個中央銀行的代表參加。參加者分享了他們在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點關注工具的校準和評估，以及它們與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。金管局亦與英倫銀行和國際貨幣基金組織共同舉辦了一場會議，內容討論了中央銀行和其他決策者在選擇最佳的貨幣、宏觀審慎和微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。會議有超過一百名參加者參加，包括來自學術界、中央銀行和國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 以助發展亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n香港金管局維持了對促進亞洲金融穩定及在國際金融事務中發揮該地區集體聲音的區域合作措施的承諾。作為國際結算銀行與EMEAP 在東亞太平洋地區中央銀行管理層會議下設立的貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監察工作協調員，香港金管局繼續準備該委員會的 上半年宏觀監察報告，以評估該地區的風險與不穩定因素以及政策影響。作為支付與結算系統EMEAP工作小組的主席，香港金管局與副主席密切合作，協調小組的不遺餘力，在風險管理、監察、標準與最優惠實務，以及國內和跨境支付與結算系統的發展方面進行交流。它亦領導了工作小組關於跨境合作與發展的分組。香港金管局在6月於香港舉辦了 EMEAP與國際結算銀行外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的會議。來自該地區及主要經濟體的17個機構的代表參加了會議，檢討了金融市場及金融監管改革的最新發展。\n\n繼簽訂香港及東盟+3 方面協議後，於2016年2月，AMRO 升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強的清邁倡議多邊化中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n金管局繼續維持與國際信貸評級機構的貼近對話，呈報香港的經濟表現和財政實力一項平衡的評估。 這些努力促進了金管局在2015年獲得所有主要信貸評級機構的肯定。標準與普氏亦肯定了香港的最高AAA級別，反映了該機構對香港作為高收入經濟體的健康展望、龐大的財政儲備、持續的健康財政表現以及強勁的淨外部資產狀況。穆迪投資者服務和標準普得也繼續維持香港的評級分別為Aa1和AA+，僅低於三A一級別。\n\n# 香港離岸人民幣業務中心發展\n\n在 2015 年，市場因素對香港的人民幣匯款池產生了影響。年底時，未結清的人民幣客戶存款和存款憑證為人民幣 1,010 億，對比去年同期的人民幣 1,158 億（圖 1）。離岸人民幣債券發行下，內地市場利率下跌，有所放緩。結果，香港的人民幣債券發行下降至人民幣 750 億。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易增加 9%，達到人民幣 6,833 億。未結清的人民幣銀行貸款金額亦增加 58%，至人民幣 297 億（圖 2）。人民幣即時總額結算 (RTGS) 系統的平均每日成交額增加至人民幣 947 億，較 2014 年上升 29%。同時，香港的離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，調查結果顯示，截至 2015 年 4 月底，每日成交額約為 930 億美元的等值金額，較 2013 年 4 月上升 88%，當時進行了最後一次 BIS 三年期調查。香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場具有相當的深度和廣度。另一個鞏固這一地位的重要發展是 7 月推行了 MRF 倡議，擴大 了香港的人民幣產品種類。有人員協助處理。\n\n香港金管局的政策舉措，旨在擴大跨境人民幣資金流動的渠道，以及與業界共同努力優化香港的人民幣金融平台，繼續產生了成果。6月，中國人民銀行宣布，境外的離岸人民幣業務清算銀行和參與銀行將容許在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將收益匯往離岸，以增進離岸市場銀行的人民幣流動性管理。9月，中國人民銀行放寬了跨境人民幣資金集中管理規則，使更多的跨國公司能夠在簡化安排下進行集團內資金轉移。大陸方面亦於7月授予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構和主權財富基金較廣泛進入境內銀行間債券市場的機會。他們更於9月開放了大陸的外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n11 月 30 日，國際貨幣基金組織宣布了將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子的決定，自 2016 年 10 月 1 日生效。此決定 подтверждает 人民幣作為一種可自由使用的貨幣的地位，並進一步推動了對人民幣在全球交易中使用信心。作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化以及中國大陸與全球經濟和金融體系聯繫加強所帶來的新的商業機會中受益。\n\n香港繼續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務上的合作，全 年。香港金管局與澳洲共同舉辦了第3季人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦了第五季人民幣商業論壇，並與馬來西亞和泰國第二次合作，促進私營部門就人民幣業務的討論。通過這些措施，香港的銀行轉強了其人民幣業務流動及與其他市場的聯網，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金管局亦加強了其營銷工作，以促進人民幣在貿易、投資和融資當中在公司及機構中的較廣泛使用，透過參與香港及海外市場的大事紀要，包括加拿大、日本和非洲。\n\n香港金管局副行政長官尤正球先生，於 2015 年 12 月 11 日香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五會議期間，在一場研討會上發表演講。\n\n# CEPA\n\n一份新的協議在11 月根據更緊密的經濟合作安排（CEPA）框架下簽署，旨在達到中國大陸與香港之間服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014 年在廣東提交的大部分試點自由化措施擴展到全國。 根據原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，新協議預計將提供這些銀行在中國大陸從事業務時更大的政策確定性和更大的靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n金管局繼續向中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行保險監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。 此外，除了處理中央銀行業務和一般風險管理方面的課程，也包括消費者保護、信用職權範圍、貨幣和抵押品管理、金融健全性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。 亦有針對海外銀行和執法機構代表團進行宣傳性的課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n在該年，金管局安排了八項體制化政府債券的投標，總金額為 204 億本港元。截至 2015 年底，未償還的體制化債券總金額為 689 億本港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based

儲備管理\n\n2015年是全球金融市場動盪的一年，帶來了前所未見的挑戰給投資基金。下艱鉅嚴苛且艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境中，投資基金錄得整體投資回報為-0.6%。然而，由於香港金管局過去數年調配的一系列防禦部署，有效提升了投資基金的韌性，使其損失相對溫和，對比主要市場指數和可資對比的投資基金而言。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n外匯基金的 首要 目的是，按照《外匯基金條例》 訂明， 直接或間接  影響 香港的貨幣匯率。基金 可  亦 被用於 維持 香港的貨幣和金融系統的 健全性， 以應付 維持 香港作為國際金融中心。外匯基金由財政司長控制，並可在財政司長 諮詢 外匯基金諮詢委員會 (eFAC) 後， 投資 於任何證券或其他資產，並 認為 這些資產是 適當的。\n\n# 基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已制定以下投資目標。\n\n（a）保障資本；\n（b）確保整體貨幣基礎，在所有次，均能全面以高度流通性極高的uS美元計價資產充實；\n（c）確保有充足的流通性可得，以應付維持貨幣及金融穩定的目的；以及\n（d）在（a）至（c）的條件下，達到一項投資回報，以幫助保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標十足地考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並融入了基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置。\n\n大致發表演說，外匯基金擁有兩項主要投資組合——支持投資組合和投資投資組合。支持投資組合持有極高流通性美元計價資產，以保障貨幣基礎，並須要依照緊縮貨幣安排提供十足支持。投資投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股本市場，以保障資產的價值和長期的購買力。兩項投資組合整體而言的長期目標債券與股本比例為72:28。就目標貨幣配置而言，81%的資產配置於美國和香港的貨幣，餘下19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並優化中長期回報，金管局已採取謹慎且循序漸進的有序方式，將部分投資組合的投資分散投資到多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場和內地債券及股票、私募股權以及海外投資物業。新興市場和內地的債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。金管局在LTGP下投資的資產淨值上限維持在匯儲基金累積盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下投資的市值總計1,421億本港元，包括913億本港元的私募股權和508億本港元的房地產，未償投資承諾達1,224億本港元。\n\n策略性投資組合，於2007年設立，旨在為交易所基金持有收購自政府的香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，其目的具有策略性，由於此投資組合的特殊性質，並未包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程分別以兩種資產分配的決定為基礎——策略性資產分配和戰略性資產分配。策略性資產分配，反映於投資標的，顯示了鑑於外匯基金的投資目標，最佳的長期資產分配。在策略性分配的指引下，資產會戰略性地分配，以爭取在標的之上獲得額外回報。這通常意思是實際分配與標的或策略性分配有所不同。實際分配與標的分配之間的差異，被稱為「戰略性偏差」。雖然標的以及戰略性偏差的限額由財政司長在與外匯基金諮詢委員會的商討中制定，戰略性決策則由香港金管局在權限授權下作出。於容許的戰略性偏差限額範圍內，投資經理可採取 позиции，以利用短期的市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局職員於外匯基金管理部門直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，當中包括整體支持投資組合及部分投資組合。此部分投資組合包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具套現投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理員\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局聘用位於多個國際金融中心的外匯基金經理，管理約24%的聯邦儲備基金的資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合和其他專業資產。聘用外部經理的目的是運用市場上可得的最優惠專業投資技術，捕捉多元化的投資形式，並將知識和資訊從市場傳遞給內部專業人士。\n\n有關外聘經理的使用支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易成本，以及預扣和其他稅款。此項支出主要由市場因素所制定，且可能不同於年年。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年金融市場的高波動凸顯了風險管理的重要性。已為內部及外聘管理的投資組合設立了嚴格的控制和投資指南，並密切監察指南和法規的遵守情況。風險控制工具被調配以評估市場在正常及不利市場情況下的風險。香港金管局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以最優惠的使用內部及外聘經理的技能。\n\n# 基金表現\n\n# 2015年的金融市場\n\n全球金融市場在2015年極高波動。特別是股票市場，遇到前所未見的震盪。主要股票市場在首輪上半年達到新高。然而，市場情緒在第3季急轉直下，帶來了對中國大陸經濟增長的憂慮，主要股票市場失守了自年初以來的收益，錄得顯著的季度損失。全球股票市場隨着改善的市場情緒回升，但其後又朝向年底惡化。由於與中國大陸經濟的貼近關聯，香港股票遜於其他主要股票市場。\n\n在主權債券市場上，儘管有美國利率正常化及美國利率上升週期的預期，2015年美國長期國庫券殖利率仍適度上升，但正數情緒受到全球經濟增長、持續的全球通縮壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢的憂慮所遏抑。另一方面，短期歐洲政府債券殖利率下跌，甚至有人員協助跌至負面區域，這得益於歐洲央行的大力貨幣寬鬆政策。\n\n在外匯市場，uS 圓持續強化於 2015 年，uS 圓指數飆升接近 10%，下預期美國政策利率正常化將會啟動。 歐洲 歐元在首輪季顯著削弱，自 1999年以來面世以來，創下歐元歷史上單季跌幅最大的一次，原因是歐洲中央銀行在 1月宣布量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在 2015 年對 uS 圓平穩，有人員協助。\n\n二零一五年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，載於表一。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 聯匯基金的表現\n\n下Exceptionally volatile 的金融市場和艱鉅嚴苛的投資情況下，投資基金錄得 15 日 年 158 億 本港 資金的投資虧損，包括 在海外股票的 71 億 收益、香港股票的 5 億 虧損、債券的 159 億 收益、非美元 資産的 449 億 負面 貨幣 轉作 生效，以及 基金投資控股公司 持有 的其他投資的 111 億 收益。 負面 貨幣 轉作 在 將

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

資源\n\n金管局招聘、培養並維持一支極高專業投資技術的工作隊伍，以支持其政策目標並靈活應對工作優先次的變化。雖然金管局是政府的一部分，但它能夠以與公務員不同的條款聘用人員，以吸引擁有適當經驗和專業投資技術的人才。作為一個公共機構，金管局旨在保持精簡且靈活的架構，並調配人員資源以推行新的措施，滿足增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n繼支付系統及儲值設施條例的生效後，金管局（MMD）於2015年12月成立了新的零售支付監察科，以履行金管局新的法定職責，負責儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的牌照發出及日常監察工作。為優化部門之間的協同效應，並重新調配人員資源，應付因推行新措施以及工作繁重和工作複雜性日益增加而帶來的挑戰，計劃於2015年重新調配數目部門的職責，並於2016年初推行。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FiD）舉行了對存款保障計劃的行政管理工作，以及從法規部（enFD）和貨幣管理局（MMD）的貨幣結算功能接管。它亦從銀行業相關部門接管了若干銀行業相關工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展以及銀行從業員加強能力發展框架。\n\n外部部門舉行了對MMD市場開發功能的接管，而後者將繼續其與財政市場協會及金融基準有關的工作；並且。\n\n法規部舉行了接管反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險部門的職務，從銀行監管部門處，並更名為執法及AML部門。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人手編制\n\n現行香港金融管理局於2015年成立乃841。此數字增加34至875（上升4%），以確保提供充足資源，應付（i）新立法和措施的推行，(ii) 證明必要且持續進行的試點項目，以及（ii）現行工作的日益繁重和數量。新的職位調配至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行和金融穩定，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場審查、推行國際銀行標準以及同行評審。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n推行有關場外衍生金融商品透過銀行和經批准的貨幣經紀人進行的監管框架，並依照新生效的場外衍生金融商品申報及記錄保存規定。\n\n加強反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資的監管和執法力度；\n\n為推行《金融機構（解決）法案》而進行規劃及籌備工作，此法案旨在解決金融業「大到無法倒閉」的問題，並應用國際標準。\n\n以助發展銀行業的能力建設，透過發展銀行獨立非執行董事賦權計劃，進一步改善銀行的治理，並與業界合作促進銀行從業員在銀行運作核心範疇的增強能力框架。\n\n提升銀行行為政策及在新銀行、證券和保險產品的研發能力；\n\n加強消費者保護和消費者教育工作；以及\n\n加強對岸內人民幣市場及人民幣的監測與分析，以推動香港離岸人民幣市場的有序發展。\n\n加強投資、風險管理及法律支援，以配合未來基金的成立及聯匯基金投資產品的豐富擴展，並鑑於日益艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境，加強策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n推行新的法定制度，賦予香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及預付卡牌發牌條例》監管預付卡發牌及零售支付系統的權力。\n\n\n# 企業職能\n\n臨時的資源會調配以滿足其他工作需求。香港金管局會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展局，以協助處理香港或香港金管局關注的活動或政策措施。部分員工會以全職或兼職的基礎調配，向香港存款保障基金和期貨公會提供營運支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審閱機制\n\n財政司司長 (FS) 在現行市場利率及慣例下，經外匯基金諮詢委員會 (eFAC) 的建議，決定香港金管局員工的薪酬及服務情況。薪酬包括總額現金福利及公積金計劃，實物福利基本。現金福利由每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬組成，可根據個人表現每年一次性地以總額 (sum) 形式頒發，取決於 (depending) 情況。\n\n香港金管局員工的薪酬，鑑於財政司司長收到由外匯基金諮詢委員會 (eFAC) 向他提出的建議，每年均由財政司司長檢討，包括了前一年金管局表現的顧問公司 (consultants) 評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司對金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。為維持員工的薪酬競爭力，有時可針對個別表現卓越的員工採取特別的薪酬調整。\n\n任何已批准的年度薪酬調整或香港金管局的浮動薪酬獎項，均根據員工的表現發放予個別員工。香港金管局的投資專業人士會面對一套浮動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎項之間的聯繫。執行董事級別或以上個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，需經財政司司長在顧諮詢委員會的建議下批准。相關員工在討論其薪酬的會議上並不在場。部門主管級別及以下個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，由香港金管局行政長官基於財政司司長授權並於批准的整體薪酬獎項範圍內制定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

匯生基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n匯生基金財務報表\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 財政司長先生\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於 12 月 31 日的財務報表，該報表載於第 134 頁至 222 頁，內容包括聯匯基金和本集團於該日期的表，以及截至該年終止的收入與支出帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策及其他說明性資訊的概要。\n\n# 貨幣發行機構對財務報表的權限\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，須根據行政長官根據《流通資金條例》（第66條）及香港財務匯報準則所頒布的指示，以真實而公平的呈述方式作出編製，並就金管局認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤呈述所必要的內部控制負責。\n\n# 審計人員的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我根據行政長官根據《交換基金條例》第7條及審計署審計準則發出的指示，進行了審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德要求，並計劃和執行審計，以取得關於財務報表是否包含重大錯誤的合理保證。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得有關財務報表數額及披露的審計證據。所選擇的程序取決於審計人的判斷，包括評估財務報表重大錯報的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤引起。在作出這些風險評估時，審計人會認為與實體編製財務報表的內部控制有關，以設計在情況下適當的審計程序，但並非為了表達對實體內部控制成效的意見。審計也包括評估所使用的會計政策的適當性以及貨幣管理處所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據是充足且適當的，足以提供我對審計意見的依據。\n\n# 審計長報告（繼續）\n\n# 意見\n\n在我意見中，財務報表妥為呈現了匯生基金及本集團截至2015年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該年終止日期的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港財務匯報準則編製，且符合行政長官根據《匯生基金條例》第7條所作的指示。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主管\n\n7 4 月 2016\n\n審計委員會\n26樓\n入境大廈\n七  Gloucester

主要活動\n\n貨幣追蹤者，作為金融司庫的授權，根據《流通基金條例》（上限66）的條文，管理流通基金（該基金）。該基金的主要活動是維護香港貨幣的匯率價值，以及維持香港貨幣及金融系統的健全和穩定。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：支持投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略性投資組合。支持投資組合的資產完全符合香港特別行政區貨幣發行制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略性投資組合持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的收購。營運部門信息載於筆記31。\n\n# 2 重大會計政策\n\n# 符合聲明\n\n這些財務報表是根據所有適用香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，而香港財務報告準則是一個統稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）以及香港會計師公會發行的詮釋，以及香港公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（以下統稱為「本集團」）採納的重要會計政策概要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，首輪生效或可得供早期採用，適用於現行會計期間。附注3提供有關因首次採用這些發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有）的資料，以適用的範圍反映於此財務報表所載的現行及之前期間。\n\n# 聯匯基金 – 財務報表附註 繼續\n\n數額以港元列示，除非否則。\n\n# 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務載於附註16和17。\n\n財務報表的編製以歷史成本為評估基礎，除以下資產及負債以其公允價值以…計，具體說明請參閱以下會計政策所制定。\n\n交易金融工具（附註 22.6）；\n指定按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 22.6.2）；可得出售的證券（附註 22.6.2.5）；\n金（附註 11）；以及\n投資房地產（附註 22.12）。\n\n按照香港財務匯報準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用和已匯報的資產、負債、收入和支出數額。這些估計和相關假設基於經驗以及其他各種因素，認為在情況下是合理的，其結果構成了判斷資產和負債賬面價值（這些價值並非來自其他資料來源）的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。如果修訂會對單一期間造成影響，則會於估計被修訂的期間內認可會計估計的修訂；若修訂影響現行及未來期間，則會於修訂期間及未來期間認可修訂。\n\n附註18 包含有關投資物業公允價值估計的假設。附註37 包含有關金融工具公允價值估計的假設。除了附註2.5所列的若干金融工具的估值外，並無關鍵會計判斷涉及集團會計政策的應用。\n\n# 子公司及少數股東權益\n\n子公司是集團控制的實體。集團在與該實體有參與關係時，若暴露於或擁有來自該參與關係的浮動回報，並且有能力透過對該實體的購買力來影響這些回報，則被視為控制該實體。在評估集團是否持有權力時，僅考慮具有實質意義的權利（由集團和其他方持有）。\n\n# 聯匯基金 – 財務報表附註 繼續\n\n數額以港元列示，除非否則。\n\n對子公司之投資，自控制實施日起至控制停止日止，均會合併入本集團之財務報表。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內往來餘額、交易及現金流量，以及源於集團內交易的任何未實現利潤及虧損，均予全數抵銷。\n\n非控制權益代表未直接或間接歸屬於基金的子公司股權，且就此，本集團並未與該等權益持有人協定任何增發的條款，而這些條款將導致本集團整體產生就該等權益的合約義務，且符合金融負債的定義。非控制權益於本集團資產負債表內呈交於股權項下，與歸屬於基金所有者之股權分開呈列。非控制權益於本集團的結果中，呈交於本集團收入與支出表及本集團全面收益表上，作為盈餘或赤字及總全面收益或虧損在非控制權益與基金所有者之間的分攤。\n\n在基金的資產負債表上，其於子公司之投資以成本減除減損損失，若有（附註 2.14）。\n\n# 2.4% 合作夥伴關係及合資企業\n\n一位聯營公司是本集團對其管理層具有重要影響力，但並無控制權或共同控制權的實體，透過其參與財務及營運政策決策的購買力來實現。\n"}
