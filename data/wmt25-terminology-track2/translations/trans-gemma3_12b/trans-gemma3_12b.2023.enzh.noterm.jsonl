{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment.

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n","zh":"# 2024年及以後的優先事項\n\n踏入2024年，香港經濟預計將繼續以穩健步伐復甦，主要得益於持續反彈的入境旅遊業、公共基礎設施項目以及穩定的消費支出。然而，外部環境充滿風險及不確定性，尤其與美國未來利率走勢、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢有關。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來累計的充裕緩衝，仍然具備應對不利衝擊的良好能力。\n\n香港金管局非常重視維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將密切關注不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，力求及時識別新興風險並以靈活的方式應對。 同時，我們亦會尋求機會，並創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的首要地位。 在管理投資基金於此充滿挑戰的投資環境下，我們將繼續謹慎投資，並保持彈性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與完整性\n\n近年全球經濟的不確定性持續存在，預計此趨勢將延續至2024年。香港金管局將密切關注最新動態，並時刻警惕潛在風險，以維護金融體系的穩健及穩定，這是持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務所不可或缺的。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場或將因美國貨幣政策前景的諸多不確定性、不斷演變的地緣政治風險以及不均衡的全球經濟復甦而出現波動。2024年同時也是一個重要的選舉年，世界各地將舉行多場 крупных選舉。這些選舉結果可能進一步加劇市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來累計的緩衝，具備承受不利衝擊的能力。香港金管局亦具備維護香港貨幣及金融穩定所需的實力、資源和承諾。\n\n金管局將繼續密切監察本地及外部環境中出現的風險及漏洞，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦將研究影響香港經濟的議題，評估及應對與此等議題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維護金融穩定\n\n二零二三年，全球各地新舊地緣政治緊張局勢紛紛湧現，部分問題仍未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定性，預計將持續延續至二零二四年。高利率是全球經濟面貌的突出特徵，而進入二零二四年，利率仍維持高位。在銀行業內部，持續推動數碼化進程以及實施新技術，包括人工智能，帶來了諸多優勢，但也同時帶來了新的營運和網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。面對如此動盪的政治、經濟和科技環境，香港金管局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行應對衝擊的能力。 同時，我們將繼續完善和調整銀行監管和規管框架及政策，並將科技發展、客戶期望轉變，以及國際標準和最佳實務納入考量。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑒於日益嚴峻的宏觀經濟環境，香港金管局將特別關注授權金融機構（AIs）的資產品質，並評估其信貸風險管理及監控的有效性，尤其是在貸款分類、備抵呆帳措施及處理不良貸款方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業界保持密切溝通，以確保授權金融機構在經濟周期內，在採取審慎的信貸風險管理和履行其融資中介功能之間取得恰當的平衡。 尤其，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行獲得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景不明朗，加上地緣政治緊張局勢加劇，或會增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金管局將會將警惕列為首要任務，並將繼續有效監察資產管理機構的流動資金及市場風險管理。\n\n# 針對2023年銀行動盪汲取的教訓後續行動\n\n金管局將會落實內部審查中識別出的後續行動，以應對美國及歐洲在2023年發生的銀行動盪。這些行動旨在進一步加強監管成效，並提升其應對未來可能出現的銀行危機的能力。具體措施包括：在金管局的監管審查過程中，加強對銀行賬簿中人工智能（AI）的利率風險監控；鑒於銀行服務持續數碼化，提升人工智能應對流動資金壓力的準備；簡化金管局的危機管理流程；以及進一步加強跨機構及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監察人工智能（AI）在達成完全符合《金管局監察指引手册》（SPM）OR-2模組「營運穩健」方面的進展，並評估及基準各銀行對可合理預見的中斷事件的容忍限度，旨在提升整體銀行體系的穩健性。就網絡風險而言，我們將監察各人工智能（AI）根據《網絡穩健評估框架2.0》進行的新一輪自我評估，並監察各人工智能（AI）實施安全的三級數據備份，以提升其在面對破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑒於銀行營運數字化進程不斷加快，香港金管局將密切關注生成式人工智能及分布式賬簿技術等先進科技應用所衍生的新風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，建立靈活且預防性的機制，以應對日益嚴重的網絡詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資\n\n為維護銀行體系的健全性及提升客戶信心，金管局將於二零二四年重點關注高風險領域，並優先推行以風險為本的監管更新，包括發布指引，以支持有效、以風險為本地實施政治敏感人物相關要求變動，以及支持穩定幣發行商監管制度的落實。我們亦將發布指引，協助人工智能優化其交易監察系統，並促進人工智能的負責任使用，並透過主題工作，重點關注針對高端洗錢活動的監控。為加強對數字欺詐的回應，並減少受害者損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就將銀行間信息分享範圍從企業賬戶擴展至個人賬戶的建議案，並根據收到的意見，跟進所需的立法修訂。我們將整合多間銀行相關的打擊洗錢數據，並與現有的生態系統欺詐分析系統接駁，全面構建宏觀分析系統 3.0。此舉將有助於更快速地跨銀行應對，並進一步提升我們以數據為本的打擊洗錢及反恐融資監管，使我們能夠更迅速、更果斷地應對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n二零二四年，香港金管局將加強對人工智能（AI）在提供資產管理、銷售證券、投資產品及保險，以及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的行為進行現場審查和離線監察。 具體而言，我們將重點關注「滬港通」資產管理互聯互通計劃（跨境資產管理互聯互通計劃），數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保單貸款業務，並將參考最新的市場發展以及不斷演變的國際標準。\n\n金管局將密切與其他監管機構及銀行業溝通，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售，適時提供指引。 尤其為支持虛擬資產（VA）行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為虛擬資產行業而設的監管制度健全、全面且審慎協調。\n\n金管局將協助並監察業界實施跨境融資者融資平台（WMC）的改進措施，並將繼續與業界及相關監管機構溝通，進一步完善此計劃。我們亦將繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適時整合及闡明指引，以促進業界的合規。除信託業務外，我們還將開始根據《證券及期貨條例》對提供共同投資計劃托管服務的虛擬資產（AI）的第13類受規管活動進行監察，此項監察將於2024年10月2日生效。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n金管局旨在根據《支付系統及預付卡牌發出商條例》（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發布的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施（FMI）的安全及效率。我們將繼續參與支付及市場基礎設施委員會-國際證券監管組織（IOSCO）的PFMI實施監察及評估工作，以及其他國際工作小組，商討實施新的、創新的FMI相關倡議。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適時檢討及加強我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際慣例以及市場和科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續加強及完善其銀行監察及監管框架和政策，並將參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 香港巴塞爾標準的實施\n\n預期修訂的《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR），以實施巴塞爾三框架最終改革方案（最終方案），將於立法會通過修訂後的規則後，於2025年1月1日生效。 2024年，香港金管局將繼續準備實施這些規則所需的輔助指引、銀行回報及標準披露範本及表格。 具體而言，我們計劃：\n- 於2024年第二季諮詢業界，就《風險加權資產管理模組 CA-B-3「反周期資本緩衝（CCyB）– 私營部門信貸風險地域分配」」及回報表 MA(BS)25「有關反周期資本緩衝的季報」的修訂案進行討論，以反映最終方案實施及已修訂的國際銀行統計回報表所帶來的後續變動；及\n- 最終確定執行市場及信貸估值調整風險新標準的僅限報告要求的配套措施，該要求將於2024年7月1日生效。\n\n有關《銀行（風險限額）規則》（BELR）及《銀行（流動性）規則》（BLR）的建議修訂，其中大部分與已修改的《業務 собрание規則》（BCR）最終方案的實施有關的條文，亦計劃於一月一日生效。香港金管局計劃於二零二四年完成對相關監管報告的建議修訂。\n\n同時，巴塞爾銀行監督委員會已於2022年12月及2023年12月分別發布了關於銀行對加密資產風險的審慎處理新標準及相關的針對性修訂，預計本地將於2025年實施該標準。香港金融管理局將檢討就《銀行業收支法規》、《銀行牌照條例》、《銀行從事受規管活動指引》及《外匯及結算系統指引》等各項法規可能需要的修訂，並於2025年上半年進行法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n金管局計劃根據二零二三年三月美國及歐洲銀行動盪所汲取的經驗教訓，以及監管要求及國際標準的發展，更新若干次要風險管理指引模組。這些模組包括：\n"}

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍錄得正增長， وذلك主要歸功於內地旅遊業及本地消費需求的復甦。 隨著經濟復甦，勞工市場持續改善，而通脹則維持溫和水平。 由於金融環境收緊及市場情緒疲弱，資產市場維持低迷。 預計2024年的經濟活動將進一步溫和復甦，但前景仍受多重外部不確定因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n經歷過前一年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰，香港經濟於2023年穩健增長3.2%（見表1及圖1）。本地方面，勞工市場狀況改善以及政府推出的多項支持措施，例如消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動，帶動私營消費顯著回升。儘管金融環境收緊，總體投資開支相較於去年同期低基數，仍錄得顯著增長。外部方面，香港的服務出口強勁反彈，主要歸功於入境旅遊業的強勁復甦。然而，這項正面影響已被強勁的離境旅遊業（計入服務進口）所抵消。另一方面，商品出口表現疲弱，受到外部需求不足的影響，拖累了香港的本地生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖一 實際本地生產總值增長分項貢獻\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n表一 經支出的組成部分劃分的實際國內生產總值增長（期對期）\n註：毛額固定資本形成季度環比調整後的變動率數據無法取得。\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2023年本地通脹維持溫和，由於外部價格壓力逐漸緩解，而本地成本壓力大致受控，儘管隨著經濟復甦而略為上升（見圖2）1。 總體而言，2023年核心通脹率和整體通脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n二零二三年勞工市場狀況進一步改善，七月份失業率降至十年低位的百分之二點八，其後餘下月份亦維持在低水平（圖3）。總就業人數增加（圖3）以及勞工隊伍擴大，反映了勞工需求及勞工供應均有所增長。鑒於香港勞動力短缺的情況，政府於二零二三年推出多項勞工輸入計劃及人才吸引措施（3及4）。同時，由於勞工市場供求緊張，名義工資及勞工收入的按年增長率逐漸回升至疫情前水平。\n\n圖表 2 隱藏的消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初 стабилизировавшись 後，本地股市在下半年轉趨沉靜。香港股市延續了2022年底的反彈，於2023年1月27日創下年內高位，收報22,689點（見圖4）。其後步退並進一步下跌至低位，反映出因美國及瑞士三月份的銀行業問題，以及下半年的全球經濟前景疲弱和金融環境收緊，導致市場情緒低迷。恒生指數年末收於17,047點，較2022年底大幅下跌13.8%，標誌著連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n二零二三年首四個月，受益於內地及香港經濟逐漸恢復常態，住宅物業市場經歷了反彈，但隨後因按揭利率上升及市場情緒低迷而回落。總體而言，二零二三年住宅價格按年下跌6.9%，而住宅成交宗數進一步下降4.5%，錄得歷史新低，達43,002個單位。儘管住宅價格略為調整，房屋可負擔性仍然吃力。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面臨挑戰，寫字樓、零售舖位及士多工業大廈的價格進一步下滑。由於在家工作安排普及及供應量增加，寫字樓租金持續承壓。另一方面，隨著內地旅遊業復甦及私人物業消費改善，零售舖位租金在二零二三年上升。\n\n圖四 資產價格\n資料來源：地政總署及香港交易所及結算所\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零二四年，香港經濟預計將繼續以穩健步伐復甦。訪客數字預計會進一步擴大， وذلك 得益於處理能力的不斷提升以及政府推廣大型盛事的努力，而本地消費活動則應會得到穩定的勞動市場的支持。政府將推行的各項基建項目，亦將為經濟提供支持。 另一方面，香港的商品出口預計將會穩定下來，並隨著全球科技周期預期的回升而有所改善。政府預測二零二四年實際本地生產總值將穩步增長 2.5% 至 3.5%。然而，前景受到多重風險及不確定因素的影響，包括源自美國利率走勢、科技周期復甦的步伐、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢等。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2024年將維持溫和，外部價格壓力減弱有助抵消經濟持續復甦及租金上升帶來的成本上漲。市場普遍預測2024年整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預測整體及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞工市場預期將受益於持續的經濟復甦，而各項勞工輸入及人才吸引計劃將繼續有助於緩解各行各業的人力短缺。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n二零二三年，香港銀行業面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行動盪引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及中國內地及香港經濟復甦進度低於預期。儘管如此，香港銀行業依然穩健，並持續受益於雄厚的資本和流動性儲備。儘管不良貸款比率有所上升，銀行業的資產品質仍然保持健康。 銀行盈利能力顯著提升，主要得益於淨利息收入的增長。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n截至2023年末，銀行業不良貸款比率上升至1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%有所提高，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦增至1.24%，較2022年末的0.85%上升（圖5）。與內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率也從2022年末的2.26%上升至2023年末的2.58%。不良貸款比率的上升主要歸因於對內地房地產開發商的風險評級下調。儘管如此，銀行所提列的準備金仍然充足。截至2023年末，準備金覆蓋率（即總準備金與不良貸款的比率）為75%。若將抵押品市場價值納入考量，調整後的準備金覆蓋率將達到約145%。同時，截至2023年末，住宅按揭貸款和信用卡貸款的不良貸款比率仍然維持在低位，分別為0.08%和0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行業資產品質\n註：數據涵蓋香港分行、海外分行及主要海外子公司。\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖六 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n二零二三年，銀行業錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行全年稅前經營利潤總額上升了 62.1%，而稅後平均資產收益率則從同期 0.57% 上升至 0.89%（見圖7）。盈利的改善主要歸功於淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及與去年溫和虧損相比，二零二三年投資組合的顯著收益。然而，貸款減損準備金的增加（+28%），由於為新分類貸款計提了特定準備金，部分抵消了上述增長。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息率從一年前的 1.31% 擴大至 2023 年的 1.68%（見圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本收入比率從 2022 年的 48.0% 下降至 2023 年的 38.8%（見圖9）。\n\n圖七 零售銀行業績\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨利息差額\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本收入比率\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n二零二三年，銀行業資產負債表增長0.9%，主要受持有的可轉讓債務工具（+8.6%）和銀行間融資（+4.4%）的增長所帶動，但總貸款的下降則部分抵消了這一增長。 由於借貸成本上升以及全球經濟前景疲弱，導致貸款需求低迷，二零二三年總貸款減少了3.6%。 在總貸款中，香港本地貸款基本持平（-0.4%），而以外地及貿易融資貸款分別減少了10.4%和13.1%。 與內地相關的貸款在二零二三年減少了6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，截至2023年底，總存款較2022年上升5.1%，而2022年增長為1.7%。由於總貸款下降，而總存款增加，整體貸款與存款比率從一年前的68.5%下降至2023年底的62.8%（見圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n二零二三年，銀行業的資本化狀況良好。截至二零二三年底，本地註冊認可金融機構（AI）的合併總資本比率為百分之二十一點一，較前一年度的百分之二十點一有所上升。第一級資本比率為百分之十八點九（見圖十一）。這兩個比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求。巴塞爾三級杠杆比率截至二零二三年底為百分之七點九（見圖十二）。\n\n圖表10 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖表 11 本地註冊人工智能的合併資本比率\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖表 12 本地註冊人工智能的綜合杠桿比率\n來源：香港金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行業持續維持穩健的流動性狀況。第一類金融機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋率 (LCR) 於2023年第四季為178.6%，而第二類金融機構的季度平均流動性維持率 (LMR) 為65.7%（圖表13）。銀行業的主要資金來源仍為客戶存款。截至2023年末，第一類金融機構的淨穩定資金比率 (NSFR) 和第二類A金融機構的核心資金比率 (CFR) 分別為144.4%和169.4%（圖表14）。這四項比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖表 13 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n來源：香港金管局\n\n圖表十四 指定人工智能的融資比例\n來源：香港金管局\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n二零二三年，在市場預期美國利率將維持高位的背景下，港元主要在聯繫匯率制度的弱方可換匯空間內波動，從二月中旬至五月初期間，弱方承兑承諾被觸發八次。自五月起，港元有所回升，年末的匯率約在 7.8 的中央即期匯率附近。在聯繫匯率制度下，該制度於二零二三年慶祝四十年週年，香港銀行同業拆息利率大致追蹤其美元對應利率，同時也受到本地供求影響。總體而言，港元匯市和貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地展現出其強健及應對外部衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為香港幣對美元的外部匯率在匯率制度框架內保持穩定，其匯率範圍為每美元七點七五至七點八五港元。貨幣制度的結構特點是採用緊縮準備金制度，要求貨幣基礎至少以百分之百的美元儲備在匯儲基金中備抵，並且貨幣基礎的任何變動必須完全與匯儲基金中美元儲備的相應變動相符。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括：\n- 償債憑證，其完全備抵三家發鈔銀行發行的紙鈔；\n- 政府發行的流通貨幣及硬幣；\n- 集計結餘，即存放在香港金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和；及\n- 香港金管局代表政府發行的政府短期票據及票息憑證（EFBN）。\n\n香港法定金幣的匯率穩定，是透過自動調整利率的機制，以及金管局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）所維持。當強方或弱方聯繫匯率承諾被觸發時，金管局隨時準備向銀行買賣港幣，以美元交換，匯率分別為每美元7.75港元或7.85港元，從而擴大或收縮結餘總額，以推高或降低港幣利率，協助將港幣匯率拉回至7.75至7.85的浮動匯率範圍內。\n\n# 2023 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期美國利率將維持高位的背景下，香港 dollar 兌美元匯率在2023年持續疲弱，並主要在聯繫匯率制度的弱方保衛點附近波動。從二月中旬至五月初，弱方承兌機制被觸發八次。五月初至七月初，香港 dollar 匯率因上市公司的股息支付需求及企業中期資金需求等因素，部分恢復了升值空間。其後，香港 dollar 匯率主要受到本地資金供需變化影響，例如透過滬港通的資金流入，年末的匯率在7.8的中央價位附近成交（見圖1）。總體而言，香港 dollar 匯率市場在2023年全年持續正常運作。\n\n圖一 2023年市場匯率\n\n自二月至五月，金管局應銀行要求，按照聯繫匯率制度的設計，在弱方兌換保值機制（CU）中總共購買了515億港元。反映弱方CU的觸發，結餘總額從2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。同期，未結清的額外銀行借貸工具（EFBNs）略微增加，從1,2004億港元增至1,2455億港元。因此，結餘總額與未結清的EFBNs總和從2022年底的1,2967億港元下降至2023年底的1,2904億港元（圖表2）。 貨幣基礎整體上仍然得到外匯儲備的充分支持。\n\n圖表 2 2023 年結餘總額（未扣除貼現窗）及 聯邦基金未償還票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據利率衍生工具框架（LERS），香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）通常追蹤其美元基準利率。 由於美國在2023年前七個月持續加息，HIBOR普遍上調（見圖3）。 截至年末，隔夜、一個月及三個月HIBOR分別上升了286、92及16個基點，至6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n繼美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，基準利率已總計上調四次，共計一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上調至5.75%。 於零售層面，在美國政策利率上調後，多家銀行於五月初及七月底分別上調最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。 此外，部分銀行在年內亦上調了以HIBOR為基準的新批按揭貸款利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率從2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。 總體而言，香港貨幣市場持續正常運作。 貼現窗借款額增至2023年的388億港元，較2022年的84億港元大幅增加，且相關使用情況並未發現異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯邦元結算系統是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，已歷時四十多年，並在挑戰中展現出其穩健和韌性。儘管美國利率走勢及全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定因素，香港法定按金結算制度下的外匯及貨幣市場持續有序運作，反映了該制度的穩健性。政府對聯邦元結算系統堅定不移。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在其2023年《外部部門報告》中再次強調，聯邦元結算制度的信譽，有賴於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管及監察、靈活的經濟體制以及審慎的財政框架所保障。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對常設貸款擔保計劃（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續平穩運作，流動性狀況及資本化水平均遠超國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局已密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試的結果，並維持了對銀行貸款的監管力度。\n\n為提高聯繫匯率帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將一筆特定比例的投資基金資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）已從二零二二年年底的110.12%，上升至2023年5月4日的112.71%高位，超出112.5%的上限觸發水平（見圖4）。這主要反映了由於上半年弱方聯繫匯率觸發，總結餘額的收縮。 根據投資基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，並因償還債務憑證，資產已從支持投資組合轉移至投資投資組合，以將支持比率降至2023年5月8日的約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收市報110.73%。 根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已指定特定投資基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有投資基金資產均可支持港元匯率。 投資基金充裕的財政資源，以及穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的後盾。\n\n圖4 2023年支撐比率的每日波動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會小組\n\n聯繫基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發牌委員會（CBC）監察並審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。 於二零二三年，CBC 審議了包括二零二二年五月穩定幣市場崩盤、美國聯邦儲備局美元流動性支持措施傳導至香港銀行，以及近期香港 dollar 利率的變動等議題。 貨幣發牌委員會就這些議題的討論記錄以及提交給 CBC 的貨幣發牌營運報告，均會於香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n下表總結了截至2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣的價值：\n\n圖5 截至2023年底，各發鈔銀行流通中的紙鈔\n\n圖六 2023年末流通鈔票的分布\n\n圖七 截至2023年底流通中的紙鈔\n\n圖表 8 截至 2023 年底，流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣\n\n圖九 截至2023年底，流通政府發行的紙幣和硬幣構成分析\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n年內，香港金管局繼續為銀行出納、零售業現金員及學生舉辦關於香港鈔票設計及安全特徵的研討會，以提升他們識別鈔票的知識及技能。 2023年，共安排了15場研討會，參與人數約為3,000人。\n\n# 錢幣收藏計劃\n\n金錢紀念品計劃繼續受到市民熱烈歡迎。更多關於此計劃的資訊，請參閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中的「香港金管局可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及票息憑證\n\n聯邦基金（EFBN）計劃運作暢順。截至2023年底，結餘的聯邦基金票據總額約為1,2554億港元（見表2）。\n\n表二：EFBNs 尚待解決的問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融學會貨幣與金融研究中心（HKIMR）發表了二十篇工作論文，並舉辦了十七場研討會\/網絡研討會，探討了對香港及該區具有戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究主題。HKIMR 還在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發布了六本電子期刊，向 SSRN 的全球研究社群傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供最近發表的工作論文的高層次、非技術性摘要，HKIMR 發布了《貨幣研究洞見》兩期。\n\n除了研究活動之外，香港金融研究中心還舉辦了四項國際活動，包括一場圓桌會議和四場學術研討會\/網絡研討會，與學術界、全球央行及國際金融機構進行對話和交流，探討經濟及金融議題。\n\n# 三月九日\n\n由國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）中國區高級常駐代表巴奈特·史蒂芬博士（Dr. Steven Alan Barnett）與國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）中國－香港特別行政區常駐代表季素كل·帕卡瓦博士（Dr. Phakawa Jeasakul）共同主講的「中國經濟復甦：近期發展與展望」研討會已舉行。巴奈特博士分享了他對中國經濟最新發展的看法，以及需要應對的短期和中期問題。研討會吸引了超過一百位與會者。\n\n# 四月十七日\n\n舉辦了一場關於「應對充滿挑戰的世界」的研討會。四位國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）的專家分享了他們對國際貨幣基金組織最新發布的《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》分析章節的觀點。研討會吸引了超過五十位與會者。\n\n# 四月二十五日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）於四月發布的《全球金融穩定報告》，以「在高通膨與利率環境下維護全球金融穩定」為題，由國際貨幣基金組織貨幣與資本市場部助理主任吳博士及資深金融部門專家柏英科先生主講的研討會已舉行。超過八十位與會者參加了本次研討會。\n\n# 五月二日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）亞洲及太平洋部主任薛恩納沙臣（Krishna Srinivasan）與香港金管局總裁于學禮先生聯席主持了一場以「於充滿挑戰的世界中探討亞洲」為主題的座談會。薛恩納沙臣主任闡述了近期《亞洲及太平洋地區經濟展望》報告的主要觀點，並分享了他對全球及區域經濟的主要驅動因素和風險的看法。此外，論壇涵蓋了許多關於區域經濟和國際貨幣體系演變的重要議題。約有120位與會者參加了是次活動。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n儘管在2023年面臨多重挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月銀行風波、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，香港的銀行業依然保持強勁和韌性。金管局對三月銀行風波迅速作出應對，從管理漣漪效應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監管流程和解決框架等範疇），從中汲取經驗教訓，並繼續專注於持牌金融機構的信貸、流動資金和市場風險管理。 鑑於網絡安全威脅日益增加以及第三方科技服務的應用日益普及，金管局也與持牌金融機構緊密合作，提升其營運和網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強了對支付卡的消費者保護，透過進一步修訂《銀行業行為守則》以及推出《防詐騙消費者保護宣言》。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動制定平衡的監管框架，簡化了面向專業投資者的銷售流程，並對「跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃」進行了優化，同時開始監察信託業務。同時，已推出試驗計劃，為推行「數據智能信貸」下的消費者信貸參考服務作準備。\n\n金管局在打擊洗錢及反恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，彰顯了其以風險為本的方法，針對最高風險的承諾。為應對日益增加的 цифровo мошенничество，金管局已加強生態系統合作，透過推出實時欺詐監測，並擴大公私營部門信息分享夥伴關係的範圍，包括欺詐及洗錢情報工作小組。一個突破性的平台，旨在促進銀行間信息分享的推出，將有助於應對驢帳網絡的風險。同時，金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理日益增加的與欺詐相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對各種騙術的認識，包括在使用快速支付系統時推出的交易前警示機制。與此同時，宏觀分析試驗計劃亦提升了監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和信息披露等方面的標準。同時，亦在加強銀行業能力建設、吸引和培養未來人才以及提升現有從業人員技能方面投入了顯著努力。此外，香港存款保障局完成了對存款保障計劃建議改進方案的公開諮詢。\n\n金管局持續推進確保可信解決機制的工作。一項與獲取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決方案標準已制定完成，並已完成對實施損失吸收能力政策標準經驗的回顧。在與銀行進行解決方案規劃方面取得了顯著進展，以應對提前終止風險及解決方案中的營運持續性。金管局同時持續參與國際政策倡議和解決方案領域的區域合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標取決於一個具備高度韌性，並能夠為香港經濟所需提供關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行在營運方式及極端情況下的無序倒閉，都可能影響整個金融體系的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵角色，致力於確保銀行能夠承受衝擊並在危機發生時恢復其狀況，從而最終有助於預防倒閉事件。 金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並有權在香港授權持牌銀行、限牌銀行和從事存款業務的公司，這些機構統稱為持牌金融機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機制權威，致力於確保在人工智能機構（AI）出現不可行情況時，其失敗能夠有序處理。為達此目的，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制制度，根據該制度，金管局是人工智能機構（以及其他類別機構）的解決機制權威。為在香港推行解決機制，制定解決機制規則和政策標準、進行解決機制規劃以消除人工智能機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展金管局解決失敗人工智能機構的能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMI）。在監察FMI時，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並鼓勵透明度。提升FMI對金融危機的韌性，有助於保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受FMI運作中斷可能造成的 destabilizing 影響。\n\n# 2023 回顧\n\n# 授權條款\n\n在年內，香港金管局向兩間在香港以外註冊成立的銀行發出了一項銀行牌照和一項有限制銀行牌照。此外，金管局亦向四間外國交易平台營運商發出貨幣經紀牌許，並撤銷了先前發給一間貨幣經紀的牌許。金管局在年內撤銷了五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，請參閱附件及第313至316頁及第322至325頁的D至F表格。\n\n# 三層銀行體系審核\n\n二零二三年，香港金管局對香港的三層次銀行體系進行了全面審查，旨在簡化香港銀行體系的結構。審查結果顯示，現行的三層次體系已比實現其最初目標——在銀行業入場靈活性與保障小額存款人的保護之間取得平衡——所需的複雜度更高。 隨後，金管局於六月展開為期三個月的諮詢，就將三層次銀行體系簡化為兩層次的建議案進行討論，建議將收存機構合併至限制牌照銀行體系，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二層。 普遍而言，回應者對此建議表示支持。\n\n# 監管活動總覽\n\n二零二三年，香港金管局進行了177項離地審核，涵蓋了廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治及風險管理。為持續加強風險管治，香港金管局共舉行了38場與持牌金融機構董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會的會議。此外，香港金管局、持牌金融機構及其外部審計師還舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n除了以外地活動為例之外，金管局亦有就廣泛的虛擬資產活動進行定期實地審查。 鑒於高利率環境以及部分內地物業開發商的債務違約，信貸風險管理是重點關注的範疇。 另一方面，隨著虛擬資產對科技的應用日漸加速，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦是另一大重點。 金管局同時加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出新一輪以氣候相關風險治理為主題的審查，以及一系列諮詢會，向虛擬資產提供監管指導。\n\n自二零二三年三月起，美國及歐洲爆發的銀行風波，在規模和影響範圍上，乃自二零零八年全球金融危機以來，最嚴重的系統性銀行壓力事件。香港金管局在風波期間保持高度警惕，並採取了一系列預防措施，以確保任何潛在的影響不會動搖本地銀行及金融體系對市場的信心。事件過後，金管局進行了內部審閱，並參考了從中汲取的觀察及經驗。基於此項審閱，金管局制定了詳細的行動計劃，旨在將所學經驗納入考量，以加強監管效能，並提升應對銀行危機的能力。有關金管局在這方面的具體工作，請參閱第95頁的「流動資金及市場風險」一節。\n\n在監察合規方面，金管局對證券、投資產品、保險以及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務，以及消費者保護事宜，進行了現場審查，並配合針對評估風險較高或新舉措的領域進行的主題審閱。\n\n表一載列了香港金管局於2023年的監察工作概要。\n\n表一 監督活動總結\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款於2023年減少3.6%，與2022年的減少3.0%相比。第二表顯示貸款及墊款的增長細節。與內地相關的貸款於2023年減少6.6%，降至4,226十億港元（見第三表）。\n\n表二 貸款及墊款增長\n\n表三：與中國大陸相關貸款的增長\n\n二零二三年，金管局加強了對人工智能監控資產質素及評估其信貸風險管理措施的工作， وذلك 由於利率持續高企以及中國內地物業市場持續疲弱。 該年，銀行業的資產質素有所惡化，但仍屬可控。截至二零二三年底，銀行業的不良貸款比率為百分之一點五六，較二零二二年底的百分之點四零上升。與內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率則上升至百分之二點五八，較二零二二年底的百分之二點二六增加。\n\n年內，金管局進行了有針對性和主題性的審查，評估人工智能在信貸風險管理方面的表現，重點關注對脆弱行業的風險敞口、保費融資、對香港境外營運的信貸風險監管以及對非金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 紓解銀行客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n香港金管局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制已於七月宣布，將有秩序地逐步退出先批准本金償還寬限計劃。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在幫助合資格企業渡過疫情。 經考慮商業界的意見，已加強部分本金償還選擇，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。 即使在疫情結束後，某些行業或個別借款人仍然面臨挑戰，銀行將繼續根據個案情況，提供本金延遲償還或其他適當的信貸寬減措施。\n\n金管局同時鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但因個別情況面臨現金流壓力的企業的融資需求時， проявлять понимание。金管局提醒銀行在處理遇到償還問題的企業時，應遵循「香港處理企業困難之方法」指引，確保各銀行在處理相關事宜時，能通力合作，顧及所有債權人的共同利益。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自二零零九年起，金管局陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已強化了銀行對其物業按揭業務的風險管理，以及銀行體系應對物業價格急跌所帶來的挑戰的能力。截至二零二三年，新批住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款成數（LTV）為百分之五十七，較二零零九年九月首次推出逆周期措施前的百分之六十四有所下降（見圖一）。新按揭貸款的平均還款壓力比率（DSR）於二零二三年維持在低水平，為百分之四十，與首次應用還款壓力比率上限的二零一零年八月的百分之四十一相若。\n\n香港金管局於七月七日經考慮物業價格、成交量及本地及外部經濟環境等因素，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。 這是自二零零九年起推行有關措施以來，首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。 調整包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款成數（LTV）比例，以及根據按揭申請人資產淨值評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款成數。 此外，取消了對主要收入來源來自香港以外地區的按揭申請人，降低適用最高貸款成數及負債收入比率（DSR）上限十個百分點的要求。 香港金管局同時取消了當按揭申請人的按揭融資總額超出香港金管局正常可接受的貸款成數上限二十個百分點時，需要就適用負債收入比率上限減五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖一 新住宅按揭貸款批准的平均LTV比率及DSR\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 呈呈財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）載於第211至311頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2023年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，截至2023年12月31日止，該基金及該集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，均在香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）下真實、公平地呈列，並且已根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7節首長行政官員的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我已按照《金融管理局條例》第七條及審計署審計準則，遵照行政長官的指示進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我已按照該等準則保持獨立於本集團，並已按照該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 審核關鍵事項\n\n我認為，於截至2023年12月31日止年度，我對財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，即為關鍵審計事項。這些事項是在我對整體財務報表進行審計的過程中處理的，並且是為形成我對該等財務報表的意見所考量的一部分，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資訊。該等其他資訊包括香港金管局二零二三年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此類資訊不表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，評估該等其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯著失實。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我必須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣顧問委員會及投資基金審核委員會審核基金財務報表的職責\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《流通資金條例》第7節由行政長官發出的指示，作出真實而公平的呈述，並負責建立金管局認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣審查局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會轄下審計小組，負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否免於重大錯誤表示合理保證，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高度的保證，但並非保證依照審計委員會審計準則所進行的審計，就能在存在重大錯誤時永遠發現。錯誤可能源於欺詐或錯誤，且若單獨或總計而言，可能合理預期會影響基於此等財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為遵照審計總署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我還：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，為我的意見提供依據。因欺詐所導致未發現重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所導致的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽不實或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n取得對審計而言相關的內部控制瞭解，以設計適當於當時情況的審計程序，但並非為了表達對該集團內部控制成效的意見；\n評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性，以及貨幣機關所做的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣機關採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性做出結論，並根據所取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對該集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在我的審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或者如果此類披露不充分，則應修改我的意見。我的結論是基於在我的審計報告日之前取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團無法持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了基礎交易和事件；以及\n取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息，以表達對財務報表的意見所需的足夠且適當的審計憑證。我對集團審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我會向聯絡基金諮詢委員會審核小組匯報事項，包括審計的計劃範圍和時間表，以及重要的審計發現，其中包含我審計過程中發現的任何重大內部監控不足。\n\n我亦會向聯絡匯豐銀行顧問委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露可能影響我獨立性的所有關係及其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與交易所基金諮詢委員會審計委員會轄下審計小組溝通的事項，我判斷出在當期財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，並將其視為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為公開披露該事項會合理預期會產生負面後果，而這些負面後果將會超過公眾利益帶來的益處，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n林志源教授\n審計主任\n\n# 主要活動\n\n金管局獲財政司長授權，以匯儲基金監管員身份管理匯儲基金（該基金），並依據《匯儲基金條例》（第66章）的規定執行職責。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被劃分為四個投資組合：支持性投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略性投資組合。根據香港金管局制度，支持性投資組合的資產完全對應香港的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略性投資組合持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的而收購。營運部門的資料載於附註31。\n\n# 2 存貨核算政策\n\n## 2.1 符合聲明\n\n此財務報表已按照香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，而香港財務報告準則是一個統稱，涵蓋香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋，以及香港公認的會計原則。 本基金及其附屬公司（統稱「本集團」）採納的重大會計政策載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的或經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本集團的本會計期間首次生效或可提前採用。附註3提供有關因首次應用上述發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有）的資訊，以致於這些變動與本財務報表所反映的本期及過往會計期間的本集團而言屬相關。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n本集團的財務報表包括本集團的財務報表，以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務已於附註16及17中披露。\n\n財務報表的編製採用歷史成本作為基礎，惟以下資產及負債則按公允價值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（註2.6）；\n- 透過損益計算表按公允價值衡量的金融資產及金融負債（註2.6）；\n- 透過其他全面收益按公允價值衡量的金融資產（註2.6）；\n- 黃金（註2.10）；及\n- 投資房地產（註2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些都會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告金額。 這些估計及相關假設乃基於過往經驗及其他被認為在當時情況下合理的事項，其結果構成了評估資產及負債賬面值（這些賬面值並非可從其他來源直接得知）的依據。 實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行審核。若估計調整僅影響當期，則於估計調整期認列相關調整；若調整影響當期及未來期間，則於調整期及未來期間認列相關調整。\n\n管理層在應用香港財務報告準則時所作的判斷，若對財務報表產生重大影響，以及主要的估計不確定性來源，均在附註2.18中披露。\n\n為使與本集團截至本年度的財務報表保持一致，若干比較數字已重新列示。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及少數權益\n\n子公司是指被本集團控制的實體。本集團若能從其與該實體的參與中獲得變動回報，並且具備透過對該實體的控制權來影響該等回報的能力，則被視為控制該實體。在評估本集團是否具備控制權時，僅考慮本集團及其他方所持有的實質性權益。\n"}
