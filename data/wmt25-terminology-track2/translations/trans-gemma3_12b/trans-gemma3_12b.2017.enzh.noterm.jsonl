{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政長官致辭\n\n二〇一七年，全球經濟和金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟實現穩健增長；通脹維持溫和；美國聯邦儲備局當年三次加息並縮減資產負債表，並未導致新興市場經濟體出現資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒的推動下，全球股市，包括美國三大股指，持續創下新高。摩根士坦利新興市場指數上漲了百分之三十四。香港恆生指數在二〇一七年上漲了近八千點（或百分之三十六），並於二〇一八年一月突破三萬點水平，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在 столь благоприятной環境下都充滿樂觀，甚至洋溢著興奮之情。然而，這一切直到今年二月初，最新的數據顯示美國工資增長超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通膨風險，並引發全球股市的重大調整。在二月初的第二週，道瓊斯指數在兩天內下跌超過一千點，而香港恆生指數也在同一週下跌超過三千點。十年期美國國債殖利率飆升至高達2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉表明，創紀錄的市場估值並非建立在穩固的基礎之上。它也提醒我們，香港要應對資產市場波動和資金外流帶來的挑戰，需要一個健全且穩健的金融體系。\n\n# 銀行體系韌性因應預防措施而增強。\n\n正如所說，「預防勝於治療」。香港金管局於2017年進一步實施風險減輕措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。五月份，我們推出了針對銀行按揭貸款的第八輪逆周期措施，並加強了銀行向物業發展商的貸款信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系應對物業市場下行所引發的衝擊的能力。經過幾輪措施的實施，截至2017年底，新按揭住宅貸款的平均貸款成數降至49%，較2009年9月的64%有所下降；同時，平均還款壓力比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n於2017年，我們設立了解決方案辦公室，以執行關於解決「大到無法倒閉」的金融機構國際標準。此舉旨在防止再次發生類似2008年全球金融危機的情況，當時公帑被用於拯救陷入困境的金融機構，並將其倒閉對金融系統、經濟及社會大眾的影響降至最低。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩健可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動比率和資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，且在全球範圍內名列前茅，這無疑反映了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，貸款總額增長16%，資產質素亦保持良好水平。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年的0.72%下降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。2017年，銀行業整體股東權益回報率（以除稅前經營利潤為基礎）達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，為一個非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行業是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n二零零八年全球金融危機揭示了單純依靠規則和規章來約束金融業追求利潤，而不顧其主要責任的局限性。 鑒此，香港金管局近年來加強了「穩健營運」理念的推廣，鼓勵銀行發展並踐行良好的企業文化和價值觀。 尤其為應對銀行員工追求短期利潤，而犧牲客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立符合其企業文化和價值觀的適當獎勵機制。 作為此項活動的一部分，我們於二零一七年三月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事年會，旨在強調建立良好銀行文化的的重要性，並賦予獨立非執行董事更有效地履行監察和監督職責。\n\n得益於銀行業的支持，金管局在推動金融普惠方面於2017年取得顯著進展。六間實體銀行分行及三間流動銀行分行已開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與電子支付系統（EPS）及一間便利店連鎖店合作，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可以在偏遠地區的便利店提取現金，而無需進行購物。此外，香港郵政今年亦將在七個郵局（主要位於離島及新界）推出長者現金提取服務。至於開戶方面，金管局去年設立了一個網頁及一個電子郵件地址，並組建了專責團隊跟進公眾對銀行開戶的查詢或投訴。 由於各方利益相關者的共同努力，在開立個人及公司銀行帳戶的客戶體驗方面有了顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來變革。\n\n在科技日新月異的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這個瞬息萬變的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新發展，並在金融科技應用方面追求創新。為迎接智慧銀行新時代，香港金融管理局於九月推出七項倡議（詳情請參閱第106頁），旨在推廣金融科技在銀行業的應用，以提升客戶的銀行產品和服務質素。 儘管這些倡議彼此獨立，但它們是互補的，並將為香港的支付和銀行服務未來格局帶來變革。客戶不僅將享受更便捷、高效和安全的支付及銀行服務，還將擁有更多選擇和更大的財務交易控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁向智慧銀行新時代將為銀行升級和轉型提供絕佳機會。\n\n# 帶路及灣區倡議所創造的龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融業對香港至關重要。 2017年，香港金管局加強了其工作，以提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。 憑藉香港獨一無二的「背靠內地，同時保持國際視野」的優勢，一帶一路倡議和粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的發展，將為金融和銀行業帶來巨大的機遇，並為香港的經濟增長注入新的動力。 應對一帶一路倡議而設立的香港金管局基礎設施融資促進辦事處，自成立以來合作夥伴數量已增至約90家，為將香港打造成基礎設施投資融資中心奠定了堅實的基礎。 中國開發銀行於2017年在香港發行首批一帶一路債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所能發揮的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資外，我們正積極參與香港發展成為企業財務中心、私募股本基金及亞洲衍生品業務的樞紐，致力吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構來港管理其資金、資產及各種金融風險。 這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。 香港金管局亦與負責大灣區發展的相關部門保持密切溝通，以加強合作，為將大灣區打造為世界級城市群的金融發展貢獻力量。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「發揮香港的優勢，滿足國家的需要」為主題發展。隨著滬港股票通於2014年、深港股票通於2016年以及去年七月債券通北向交易的推出，通過香港的金融平台，內地與世界的互通市場從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為金融中介，促進全球投資者接觸內地金融市場的獨特作用。 2017年，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務的領先樞紐地位。人民幣即時總額結算系統的平均每日成交額達人民幣9000億元。此外，根據環球銀行金融電訊（SWIFT）的統計數據，該年度全球超過70%的人民幣支付交易均通過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續平穩運作，穩健發展。\n\n# 培養人才，強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業持續發展，人才培育對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金管局非常重視銀行業的軟實力，我們一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業者的持續專業發展。在推行加強能力發展框架後，我們引入了兩個關於打擊洗錢及恐怖融資以及網絡安全的模組，去年更擴展了其涵蓋範圍，納入了零售財富管理和財管業務，藉此提升銀行從業者的核心能力。香港金管局亦致力於培養銀行業的年輕人才。 2017年，我們與業界合作，推出了私人財富管理試驗見習計劃和金融科技職業加速計劃。 鑒於反應熱烈，未來將進一步擴展這些計劃的覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 謹慎的投資策略，以在 среднего до долгосрочного периода實現穩健且合理的報酬。\n\n受益於強勁的全球經濟增長，去年投資基金錄得創紀錄的投資收益 2640 億港元，股本、債券及外匯市場均錄得盈利。整體投資回報率為 7.4%。投資組合的回報率為 12.1%，而保證組合則錄得 1.8% 的收益。自 2009 年成立以來，長期增長投資組合 (LTGP) 的年化內部回報率最高曾達 13.7%。儘管去年的投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金管局繼續審慎管理投資基金。我們將保持靈活敏捷，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。長期增長投資組合的投資規模亦將進一步擴大。一如既往，在管理香港市民的財富時，我們將堅持「保本為先，長期增長其次」的投資原則，並在可接受的風險範圍內運作。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續了去年增長的勢頭，但二零一八年仍充滿不確定性和風險。這些風險包括，若通脹加速，美國可能加快加息的步伐；貿易摩擦加劇；以及地緣政治局勢惡化。若這些不利風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟造成連鎖效應。因此，我們都應審慎地管理風險。\n\n未來數月，香港 dollar 利率的走動很可能仍將成為焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已六次加息。由於香港 dollar 利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，促使資金更有動機從香港 dollar 流向美元。近期，香港 dollar 面臨貶值壓力，並觸發了7.85弱方聯繫匯率承諾（CU）。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金管局將在市場上買入香港 dollar 並出售美元，充當「超級換匯商」，以確保香港 dollar 匯率不會低於7.85水平。此類操作是正常現象，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，投資基金目前持有超過4萬億港元的資產，其中香港 dollar貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為應對資金外流提供了強大的緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已建立多條防線，以維護銀行和金融體系的穩定。從積極的角度來看，資本外流將導致香港 dollar 利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境的正常化，從而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，香港金管局將保持警惕，並竭盡所能維護香港的貨幣和銀行穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更趨於協調擴張的背景下，香港在2017年出現了更快速的經濟增長、更為收緊的勞工市場以及溫和的通脹壓力。預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在全球經濟更趨於協調擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年實現了更快的增長。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長，以及過去十年約3%的長期增長水平（見圖1及表1）。本地需求有所回升，其中私人消費增長加速，整體投資支出有所復甦。更強勁的本地需求反映了就業和收入狀況良好、資產價格蓬勃發展以及商譽氛圍改善。外部方面，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港的商品出口增速加快；服務出口則因貿易和貨物流量活躍以及入境旅遊業復甦而有所回升。受出口帶動的需求拉動，商品進口錄得更強勁的增長，而居民強烈的旅遊興趣推動了服務進口穩步上升。從淨值來看，總貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長產生了負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n就貨幣方面而言，港元兌美元的匯率大致溫和升值，主要受到港元與美元之間的負利率差，導致的套利活動所驅動。此舉反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。儘管利率仍處於相對低水平，但由於首次公開發售相關的資金需求以及年末銀行流動性需求，2017年末，港元銀行同業利率面臨更大的上漲壓力。至於信貸增長方面，在連續兩年個位數增長後，2017年銀行總貸款增長速度顯著加快，達到16.1%，反映了經濟狀況的改善和金融市場的樂觀情緒。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸承保標準並未出現寬鬆的跡象，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2017年通脹壓力一直受到良好控制（見圖2）。撇除政府的一次性紓緩措施影響，剔除後，底層通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。尤其值得一提的是，價格指數中的房屋成份升幅放緩，反映了2016年私人住宅租金上漲速度減慢的影響。更廣泛地說，名義工資和收入溫和增長，同時伴隨著強勁的產出增長，有助於控制本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹也同樣溫和，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹相符，儘管美元匯率有所走弱。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟表現超出預期，勞工市場趨於緊縮。季節性調整後的失業率從2016年的3.4%下降至2017年底的2.9%，是近20年來首次跌破3%（見圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門的失業率均有所下降，其中零售、金融以及專業及商業服務業的下降幅度尤為顯著。由於總體就業增長加速，以及私營部門空缺職位增加，整體勞工需求持續增強。勞動力規模也有所擴張，部分原因在於年長勞工（55歲及以上）的參與度提高。在勞工市場條件收緊、通膨率降低的背景下，實際工資和收入增速加快。\n\n# 股市\n\n二零一七年，香港股市經歷了近乎連綿不絕的上升勢頭。 恒生指數上漲了百分之三十六，創下自二零一零年以來的最大年度升幅（圖4）。 這一上漲反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分得益於透過滬港通及深港通等渠道，來自中國內地投資者的大量資金流入。 恒生指數在十一月創下十年新高，並在二零一七年末維持在較高水平。 平均每日成交額從前一年的六十六十九億港元擴大至八十八點三億港元，而本地市場籌集到的整體股本基金也增加至五百八十點四億港元，較前一年的四百九十點一億港元有所增長。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n全年住宅物業市場維持上升勢頭（見圖4）。成交量由一年前的五萬四千七百一十一宗增至六萬一千五百九十一宗，而房屋價格於2017年上升了14.8%。房屋可負擔能力持續惡化，價格收入比率達16.4，較1997年的峰值更高，而收入負擔比率則為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。為應對樓價上漲以及銀行間按揭業務競爭加劇的情況，金管局於五月推出第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行風險管理，維護銀行體系穩定。這些措施推出後，房屋價格增長一度放緩，但在第四季再次加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，交易活動在年內顯著增加，成交金額及成交宗數均錄得雙位數增長。由於非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年略為下降。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零一八年的經濟增長預料將持續穩健。政府預測增長率介乎百分之三至百分之四，而私營機構分析員則預計經濟平均增長率為百分之三點二。外部方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於全球經濟前景的改善以及內地旅遊業的逐步復甦。本地方面，私人消費增長預計將維持不俗水平，主要得益於良好的勞工市場狀況。至於固定資本形成，建築及地盤工程應會穩步發展， وذلك 得益於房屋供應量的增加以及持續進行的基礎設施項目。儘管改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但利率上升可能會帶來阻力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n儘管全球通脹仍然溫和，而本地成本持續上升，預料香港的通脹壓力於2018年將維持溫和水平，但通脹率有機會於2017年的低位逐漸回升。例如，通脹的租金成分或於2018年下半年加速上升，原因是新簽訂私人住宅租賃的租金上調影響逐漸顯現。市場普遍預測2018年的整體通脹率仍將維持在溫和的2.2%，而政府預測底層通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、擴大的建築活動以及入境旅遊業的逐步復甦，預計將使勞工市場在短期內維持緊張。 私營機構分析員預測，2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%左右。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n二零一八年的經濟前景，存在不少不確定因素及風險，包括與主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化、全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及加強的保護主義情緒和惡化的地緣政治緊張局勢。 尤其若此等風險成真，引發資金流動倒轉於香港，本地貨幣狀況或會比預期更快收緊，對實際經濟及資產價格構成下壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的展望仍然不明朗。短期內，目前良好的本地經濟狀況、被認為的房屋短缺、低按揭利率以及其他購房融資途徑（包括物業發展商提供的按揭貸款和家人的財務支持）將持續支持物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會影響市場情緒。從長遠來看，物業市場仍將面臨多項挑戰。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策常態化的持續進行，本地按揭利率最終將會上升。此外，在政府努力增加土地和住宅物業供應的推動下，預計房屋供需缺口將逐漸縮小，這有助於減緩物業價格的上升壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管全球經濟充滿不確定性，香港銀行業在2017年仍然保持安全穩健。獲授權金融機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況維持強勁，資產質素保持健康水平，而盈利能力則主要得益於利息淨差擴大和信貸增長強勁而顯著提升。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）一個月期和三個月期利率分別上調了49個基點和39個基點。第四季度的上調幅度則更為顯著。然而，根據綜合利率衡量，香港本地銀行資金成本在全年內大致維持穩定（見圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行香港分行在2017年的總體除稅前經營利潤增長了15.8%。 表現改善主要歸功於淨利息收入（+20.3%）和手續及佣金收入（+9.4%）的增加。 然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入的下降（-29.9%）以及經營開支的增長（+8.4%）所抵消。 由於2016年錄得的某些非經常性項目，零售銀行稅後總利潤下降了18.1%。 零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行淨利息差於2017年擴大至1.45%，較2016年的1.32%有所增加（見圖7），主要原因是市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，已從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。儘管手續費及佣金收入上升了9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務所產生的收入則下降了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行成本收入比率已從2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，原因是營運成本（上升8.4%）的增長速度低於營運收入（上升11.8%）（見圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減損損失亦從2016年的80億港元下降至73億港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n全年零售銀行貸款品質有所改善，不良貸款比率下降至0.54%，較前一年度的0.72%有所降低。 逾期及重組貸款比率亦降至0.4%，較2016年的0.53%為佳 (見圖9)。 類似地，整個銀行業的不良貸款比率和逾期及重組貸款比率分別下降至0.67%和0.52%，較前一年度的0.85%和0.67%有所改善。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素仍然良好，截至2017年底的不良貸款比率維持在低水平，為0.03%（見圖10）。 延期償還貸款比率接近零。 年末沒有任何住宅按揭貸款出現資產負值，與一年前的四宗個案相比。\n\n截至2017年底，信用卡貸款的不良貸款比率維持在0.22%，較去年同期為0.24%（圖10）。 逾期及重組貸款的總比率略微下降至0.31%，而去年同期為0.33%。 壞帳比率也小幅下降至1.75%，較2016年的1.92%。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款於2017年增長16.1%，較2016年的6.5%為高。信貸需求增加，主要受全球經濟前景樂觀的驅動。由於總存款增長速度慢於總貸款，截至2017年底，整體貸款與存款比率上升至73%，較前一年的68.4%有所提高。同期，港幣貸款與存款比率亦上升至82.7%，較77.1%（見圖11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括本地銀行在內地附屬公司錄得的貸款）於2017年增長17.5%，較2016年錄得的7%增長幅度有所加快。\n\n# 可流通債務證券持有量\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管對香港聯匯率的壓力有所減弱，香港外匯及貨幣市場仍然維持有序運作，流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實支撐，並在多種衝擊面前展現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為香港幣對美元的外部匯率在匯率市場上維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌一美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構特點是金管局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少以存放於外匯基金的美元儲備為100%支持，並且貨幣基礎的任何變動必須完全由相應的美元儲備變動所對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括：\n- 償債憑證，其提供十足的擔保，支持三家發鈔銀行發行的紙鈔；\n- 流通中的政府發行的票據和硬幣；\n- 結餘總額，即存放在香港金管局的各銀行清算賬戶餘額總和；\n- 香港金管局代表政府發行的政府票據及票息憑證（EFBN）。\n\n香港法定金幣的匯率穩定，乃透過自動調整利率的機制，以及金管局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）而維持。當對香港法定金幣的需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至每美元七點七五港元的強方聯繫匯率限額時，金管局隨時準備向銀行出售香港法定金幣，換取美元。此舉將擴大結餘總額，以降低香港法定金幣的利率，從而營造貨幣環境，使香港法定金幣從強方限額向回兌換區間（七點七五至七點八五港元）靠攏。相反，若香港法定金幣的供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至每美元七點八五港元的弱方聯繫匯率限額時，金管局將向銀行買入香港法定金幣。此舉將收縮結餘總額，以提高香港法定金幣的利率，從而使香港法定金幣從弱方限額向回兌換區間（七點七五至七點八五港元）靠攏。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n二零一七年，香港 dollar 匯率普遍面臨貶值壓力（見圖一）。主要受到隔夜拆息及美國 dollar 利率利差擴大帶動的套利交易影響，香港 dollar 兌美元匯率逐步走弱，由一月三日的 7.7566 升至八月二十二日的年內低位 7.8265。然而，在九月下旬至十一月初期間，由於首次公開發售 (IPO) 相關資金需求導致香港 dollar 流動性收緊，香港 dollar 匯率有所回升，並在 7.80–7.81 的窄幅區間內穩定波動。年末，香港 dollar 再次出現貶值壓力，部分原因反映香港 dollar 流動性狀況略有改善，以及年末商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，二零一七年香港 dollar 匯市運作暢通。\n\n由於沒有觸發計量工具，截至2017年，結餘總額與未償還外匯基金票據的總額基本不變，維持在約1,225.3億港元左右（見圖2）。 該年，香港金管局共發行了總額80億港元的額外外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行對流動性管理的需求。 這導致結餘總額在2017年末縮減至179.8億港元。 額外發行外匯基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度的原則，因為它僅代表貨幣基礎的結構調整，即從結餘總額轉移至未償還外匯基金票據。 貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備為抵押。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n一七年上半年至八月，香港銀行同業利率維持低迷，但年末開始面臨更大的上漲壓力（見圖3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表調整的擔憂，香港銀行同業利率在首八個月大致仍維持低迷。因此，香港元與美元之間的負利率差在 ஜனவரி至八月之間擴大。自九月起，短期香港銀行同業利率錄得顯著上升，主要受促成股首次公開發售及年末資金需求所驅動。相應地，短期香港元與美元之間的負利率差亦有所收窄。總體而言，一七年短期銀行同業利率主要在基準利率以下成交。\n\n基準利率已於三月十六日、六月十五日及十二月十四日分別上調，總計上調了七十五個基點，由一．○○％上調至一．七五％。 由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在年內總計上調了七十五個基點，由○．五○％至○．七五％上調至一．二五％至一．五○％，因此進行了三次調整。 基準利率的調整符合二零零九年三月二十六日公佈的修訂公式，該公式規定基準利率將定為美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限之上浮五十個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息利率（HIBORs）五日移動平均數的平均值，取兩者較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤香港元與美元的利差，香港元遠期點數的折讓在首三季逐漸擴大，截至九月中旬，12個月期香港元遠期點數達約-615點（見圖4）。第四季，隨著香港元與美元之間的負利差收窄，香港元遠期點數的折讓略為收窄。總體而言，香港貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗借款額從2016年的53億港元增加至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實支柱，並在多次區內及全球金融危機中展現出極高的韌性。政府已重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了此承諾的可信度。公眾對港元作為支付工具及價值儲存手段的信心持續強勁。國際貨幣基金組織於二零一七年與香港的第四次諮詢中，重申對聯繫匯率制度的支持，並表示聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港的最佳匯率安排。配合健全的金融監察及監管、審慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場，聯繫匯率制度有助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織表示：「聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對應收來貨幣準備金系統（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。 於二零一七年，香港金管局持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動資金及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強了對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管力度，以鞏固銀行業的韌性。 隨著美國聯邦儲備局持續調整其貨幣政策，港元利率亦將逐漸回歸正常水平。香港金管局重申，根據LERS的設計，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方聯繫匯率保衛點以及貨幣基礎減少，均是港元利率回歸正常過程中的必要環節。香港金管局同時提醒公眾審慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融波動做好準備。\n\n為提高聯繫銀行帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將一筆特定的投資基金資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率，定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎，於二零一七年期間在106.7%至108.2%之間波動，未觸及上浮或下浮觸發點。截至十二月三十一日，該比率報108.1%（見圖5）。在應變機制下，雖然已指定特定的投資基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有投資基金資產均可支持港元匯率。若遇突發衝擊，投資基金龐大的財政資源將為維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的後盾。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n聯繫基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發牌委員會小組（CBC）監察並審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。於二零一七年，CBC 審視了多個議題，包括香港物業價格短期走勢的影響因素、HIBOR（香港銀行同業拆息率）與倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）的利差、物業估值變動對中國內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭債務攤還負擔對香港私人消費的影響。有關CBC就這些議題的討論記錄以及呈交給CBC的貨幣發牌營運報告，均已刋載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR 已將其活動重新調整，更注重政策的實用性。這在中心的會議活動和訪問學者計劃中尤其體現。HKIMR 與主要中央銀行和政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為重點的會議。同時，自 2016 年起推出的主題研究訪問學者計劃，已支持更多與香港金管局關注的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n二零一七年，香港中文大學香港亞太研究所（HKIMR）共接待了十八位研究員，並發表了二十九篇工作論文。此外，該研究所於當年組織了四項國際會議和研討會：\n- 題為「中國經濟轉型：走向何方？」的第八屆國際中國經濟學術研討會於一月在香港舉行。會議為學術界、政策制定者和商界經濟學家提供了一個平台，討論與中國內地經濟相關的重要分析和政策議題。共有十一篇高品質的研究論文被發表，涵蓋了中國內地經濟轉型、結構性改革和國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題以及中國內地的貨幣政策框架和傳導等多個範疇。\n- 第十五屆香港中文大學香港亞太研究所夏季研討會於七月舉行。研討會旨在為香港中文大學香港亞太研究所及香港金融管理局的工作人員提供一個展示研究論文的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 香港金融管理局與國際銀行同業銀行聯合舉辦的題為「匯率的價格、實質及金融影響」的研討會於八月舉行。研討會提供了一個深入且富有洞察力的討論平台。涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易的定價體系、累積外匯儲備中的風險承擔以及外匯市場行為。\n- 香港金融管理局、美國聯邦儲備委員會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓」的研討會於十月舉行。研討會回顧了過去十年來主要中央銀行實施非常規貨幣政策（UMP）所汲取的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP及其對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款以及UMP對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n二零一七年，香港金管局持續將監察重點放在持牌金融機構風險監管架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動資金風險管理系統。 該年，再推出一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以增強銀行業應對物業市場下行的能力。 隨著網絡安全威脅日益增加，香港金管局加強了對持牌金融機構科技風險管理的監察。 同時，香港金管局推出七項倡議，為香港邁入智慧銀行新時代作準備。 持牌金融機構的洗錢及反恐怖融資控制的有效性，仍然是香港金管局監察工作的重點之一，作為其打擊金融犯罪的努力的一部分。 在行為監察方面，香港金管局進一步採取措施，以促進以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融普惠，並解決香港中小企業及初創公司開立及維持銀行帳戶所遇到的困難。 亦有努力提升對持牌金融機構投資及保險產品銷售行為的監察，進一步加強客戶保障。\n\n在本地實施國際監管及會計標準方面取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險集中限額、復甦計劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為配合應對瞬息萬變的銀行環境和不斷演變的風險格局所需，金管局與業界合作，制定了董事賦權計劃及加強銀行從業員專業能力發展框架。\n\n金融機構（善後）條例於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構善後制度的金融穩定理事會成員轄管地區之一。 該條例構成了金融穩定的一道全新防線，賦予金融管理局權力，在金融機構出現可能導致不良系統性後果的失敗情況下，有序處理該機構的清算事宜。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的穩定和安全。實現此目標取決於金融體系具有高度韌性，並能夠為香港經濟所需提供關鍵的金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務營運方式，以及在極端情況下因應不有序的倒閉，都可能影響系統的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機發生時恢復其狀況，從而最終有助於預防倒閉。 金融管理局負責對香港的銀行業務進行審慎監察，包括接受存款的業務。 其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為持牌金融機構（AIs）。 金融管理局還負責指定和監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證，亦無香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機制權威，致力於確保在虛擬資產營運商（AI）出現問題時，能夠有序進行解決程序，以維持其為客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的持續性。為達此目的，香港已建立一項適用於金融機構的解決機制制度，根據該制度，金管局是虛擬資產營運商（AI）等其他金融機構的解決機制權威。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n於二零一七年，已進行了 192 項離地檢查，涵蓋了廣泛議題，包括 CAMEL 評級¹、公司治理、業務營運及人工智能的風險管理。為配合金管局持續加強持牌銀行風險監管的努力，已與持牌銀行的董事會或董事層級委員會舉行了 30 次會議，討論重點是重要的風險管理議題。金管局同時進行了一項調查，以監察其近期關於公司治理的指引的採用情況。此外，金管局、持牌銀行及其外部審計師之間還舉行了 27 次三方會議。\n\n除了離地活動外，金管局持續進行定期實地審查，並配合針對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。 這種方法使金管局得以優先分配監管資源，專注於保險公司面臨的新興及更重要的風險。 過去一年，金管局共進行了 401 項實地審查和主題審查。信貸風險管理及監控仍然是這些審查和審核的重點。 另一個主要關注點是科技風險和營運風險管理。 金管局同時增加了海外審查的數量，以及針對流動性風險、市場風險管理以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）監控的實地審查和主題審查的數量。 此外，由專業團隊亦有實地審查保險公司在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動。\n\n# 信用風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n銀行總貸款增長了16.1%，與2016年的6.5%增長相比。如表2所示，貸款增長情況普遍。\n\n截至2017年底，與中國內地相關的貸款增長了17.5%，達到4,1880億港元（見表3）。 其中，通過在香港註冊成立的銀行在內地附屬公司的貸款錄得6440億港元。\n\n人工智能的資產品質在2017年仍維持健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來2.2%的長期歷史平均水平。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率從0.85%降至0.67%。至於與中國大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行該類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年降至0.75%，較去年同期為0.82%。整個銀行業的該比率則從0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n在年內，香港金管局加強了監察力度，以確保金融機構持續採納審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強了對金融機構向大型企業的信貸風險的監察。進行了有針對性的主題審查，重點關注貸款承授標準、貸款分類及備抵呆帳制度、信貸風險監管架構以及向物業開發商的貸款、資產支持型融資和保險保費融資的風險管理等關鍵信貸風險管理監控制度。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n二零一七年物業價格持續上升。同時，銀行同業結算體系（AIs）批出更多貸款予持有多按揭或收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人。 鑒於此等發展，金管局於五月十九日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高銀行同業結算體系（AIs）為計算新住宅按揭貸款資本充足率而適用的風險加權底線，降低向已持有按揭的借款人批出物業按揭貸款所適用的最高貸款成數（LTV）上限，以及降低向主要收入來源來自香港以外地區的借款人批出物業按揭貸款所適用的債務償還比率（DSR）上限。\n\n金管局自二零零九年起實施的物業按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，已提升了銀行應對房地產市場風險的能力。二零一七年十二月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款按值比例降至百分之四十九，較二零零九年九月首次引入逆周期措施前的百分之六十四有所下降。同時，平均債務收入比率亦由二零一零年八月首次應用上限時的百分之四十一，降至二零一七年十二月的百分之三十五（見圖一）。\n\n金管局留意到，部分發展商以高䅡桿方式為其物業發展項目 финансирование，並且向物業買家提供高按揭成數的按揭貸款。為應對與此類發展項目相關的風險，金管局於5月12日引入了新的貸款風險管理措施，適用於向物業發展商的貸款。這些措施包括要求持牌財務機構（AI）降低建築貸款的融資上限；要求AI為向物業發展商的貸款增加更多資本，特別是當其按揭貸款佔股本的比例較高時；以及進行一輪主題審查，以確保銀行在向物業發展商的貸款中繼續遵守審慎的承保標準。\n\n此外，金管局已於二月份與土地註冊處合作推出電子提示服務。此服務會在該按揭物業的按揭登記記錄上新增任何按揭時，向相關人工智能發出通知，以便按揭銀行採取適當的風險減輕措施。\n\n# 作業及科技風險的監督\n\n全年網絡安全威脅持續上升。香港金融管理局加強了監管力度，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的網絡安全強化倡議計劃（CFI）的一部分，30間持牌銀行完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。 另外，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），經與銀行和證券行業廣泛諮詢後，共同決定引入網上股票交易的強制性雙重認證。同時，亦進行了一輪現場審查，重點關注銀行網絡安全控制和運營韌性。香港金融管理局進一步完成了與主要銀行高級管理層的討論環節，評估銀行如何應對科技進步帶來的潛在新進入者所構成的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月份，香港金管局宣布了一系列措施，以協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，金管局將創科監管示範環境提升至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行和科技公司均可使用的聊天室，以及金管局、證券及期貨事務執行處（證監會）和保險監理處（保監處）示範環境之間的聯繫，藉此提供單一入口，以便進行跨行業創科產品的試驗。\n\n金管局同時啟動了「銀行服務通行」計劃，旨在識別並減少監管障礙，以進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。已成立專責小組，目前重點關注遠程開戶及戶口維護、網上金融及網上資產管理。\n\n為配合香港虛擬銀行牌照的發放，現已展開對現有虛擬銀行牌照指引的審閱。\n\n# 庫務活動監控與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國持續調整其貨幣政策，全球資金流動性或將變得日益波動。鑒此，香港金管局在年內加強了對流動風險的監管。金管局進一步完善了監管壓力測試，納入了更多情境，包括一種更具壓力但合理的資金外流情境，以及一種短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。金管局同時加大了對個別授權金融機構流動性狀況的監察及分析，並要求部分授權金融機構加強其流動風險管理能力。\n\n此外，金管局亦有就金融機構的債券投資組合，進行更多實地審查，以評估其市場風險管理情況。同時，進行了一系列主題審查，旨在評估金融機構增加投資外幣債券所可能產生的風險，並評估相關風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖策略。\n\n# 防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資 (ML\/TF)\n\n《防止洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》（2017年）已於六月二十三日刊憲，並將於二零一八年生效。此修訂旨在更新香港的《防止洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資》監管制度，以符合金融行動特別工作組（FATF）制定的最新國際要求。 這些變動，連同對《防止洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資》法定指引的更新，將有助闡明並實施開戶及維持真實客戶的客戶審查（CDD）過程中的風險為本方法，並鼓勵在遠程開展此等過程時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，為促進銀行和支付業界金融科技發展及應用而推出的七項新措施，受到各方利益相關者及公眾的廣泛歡迎。一系列在網絡建設和能力提升方面的努力，進一步提升了香港作為基礎建設投資融資中心的國際形象。債券通的推出，強化了香港作為通往中國內地投資機會的主要門戶的地位。香港金管局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力亦逐漸開花結果。\n\n# 總覽\n\n鑒於科技日新月異，香港金融管理局於九月份宣布推出七項先導計劃，為香港邁入智慧銀行新時代作準備。 這些先導計劃包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數字零售支付的全面互聯互通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究和人才發展；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；\n- 將現有金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0 升級至 2.0 版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行牌照的發出；以及\n- 推廣「銀行服務輕鬆辦」新倡議，以減少監管障礙，優化客戶的數字體驗。\n\n香港金融管理局的金融科技促進辦公室（FFO），以及其銀行業監管部門，在推動這些舉措的實施，鞏固香港在亞洲金融科技樞紐地位方面，發揮了關鍵作用。\n\n香港作為基礎建設融資樞紐的國際地位進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金管局基礎建設融資促進署（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量已增至87個，而創立時約為40個。 該年內，IFFO組織並參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進主要利益相關者之間的經驗分享和合作交流。 尤其值得一提的是，IFFO在首次債務融資與投資者圓桌論壇上推動了基礎建設股本投資參考條款的制定，旨在提升基礎建設項目的銀行可融資能力及投資吸引力。\n\n滬港通於七月推出，標誌著香港及內地資本市場互通發展的又一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固了我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場的橋頭堡地位。 期間，香港的人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）配額增至五千億元人民幣，較之前為二千七百億元人民幣。 香港繼續保持全球最大的離岸人民幣流動性池，並憑藉我們的人民幣即時總額結算系統的高周轉率以及全球範圍內香港人民幣支付活動的領先地位，展現出蓬勃發展的人民幣金融中介活動。\n\n自兩千十六年引入企業資金集中營運中心（CTCs）的稅務制度後，香港金管局加強了其宣傳力度，旨在吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立資金集中營運中心。截至二零一七年底，超過四十家企業向香港金管局反映，它們正積極籌劃或已設立在香港的資金集中營運中心業務。\n\n金管局積極參與國際層面關於對全球及區域金融穩定至關重要的議題的討論。金管局總裁於四月起擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）常設監管合作委員會（SRC）的主席，帶領討論關鍵的金融穩定問題。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色奠定了堅實的基礎。 截至2017年，四個銀行間即時毛額結算系統及中央貨幣市場服務單位（CMU）的系統可用率達致100%，較原定目標99.95%更高。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已在兩間中國內地中央證券存管機構（CSDs）開設賬戶，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業界的整體安全及效率，香港金管局於八月根據《支付系統及預付卡牌發牌條例》指定四個零售支付系統（RPS），納入金管局的監察範圍。金管局同時亦對十六個積極推出新產品及服務、旨在為客戶提供更多選擇及更優質用戶體驗的預付卡牌發牌人進行監察。 另外，電子支票及電子帳單示現及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 亞洲金融科技樞紐：香港\n\n# 智慧銀行方案\n\n鑒於科技日新月異，香港金融管理局於九月份宣布了七項倡議，旨在為香港邁入智慧銀行新時代做好準備。 這些倡議旨在協助銀行業提升至更高的水平，並把握銀行與科技融合帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將提供零售客戶和企業客戶之間的全面互聯互通，並讓金融服務和交易能夠以高度的便捷性、速度、安全性和靈活性進行。\n\n香港金管局一向與銀行業及金融科技社群緊密合作，並在推行七項先導計劃方面取得了顯著進展。\n\n# 更快速的支付系統\n\n此即時支付系統（FPS）是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾能夠以簡便的方式，全天候透過手機號碼或電郵地址進行實時資金轉賬。系統支援港幣及人民幣支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與此系統，達致所有支付參與者之間的全面連接。隨著系統開發工作已近完成，FPS預計將於二零一八年九月推出。\n\n此外，香港金管局牽頭組成了一個工作小組，成員包括主要的信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌結算服務營運商以及商戶收單商，旨在為香港的零售支付制定一個共通的QR code標準。 共通的QR code標準將有助於商戶使用單一的QR code接受來自多家支付服務提供商的QR code支付方案，為客戶和商戶提供更大的便利。 工作小組已完成相關的技術規格，並將會協定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API讓銀行數據可供第三方應用程式使用，以促進銀行及其他行業服務的更優化及更簡易的整合。用戶因此可以在單一系統上便捷地享受安全環境下的整合服務。為促進銀行業界採用開放API的發展，香港金融管理局制定了一份開放API架構草案，當中包括一系列開放API功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商監管、促進措施及維護模式，現正展開為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一個主要的研究項目是關於區塊鏈技術（DLT）。繼2016年發布的第一篇區塊鏈技術白皮書後，第二篇關於區塊鏈技術的白皮書於2017年10月發表。第二篇白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證項目，分別是貿易融資、數位身份管理和抵押貸款申請。它也提供了關於治理、法律與合規以及部署區塊鏈技術於銀行和支付產業的一般控制原則的實施建議。\n\n香港金管局首席行政員陳家強先生，於香港金管局金融科技日上宣布發布關於區塊鏈技術的第二白皮書。\n\n受益於香港金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證項目的成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，推出名為「香港貿易融資平台」（Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform，縮寫 HKTFP）的正式系統，旨在數字化並共享貿易文件，自動化流程，從而提升整體貿易流程效率，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險和欺詐。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金管局於2016年12月夥同香港應用科學及科技研究院，推出「金融科技職涯加速計劃」。計劃反應踴躍，共收到來自421名申請人的3,000多份申請。最終，74名學生接受了香港金管局及12間銀行的實習機會，為期六個月或一年，並於七月開始從事金融科技相關項目。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的初步步驟，我們將與深圳市合作，推廣金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於六月簽訂協議，(i) 為金融科技公司提供互惠的軟著陸支持；(ii) 聯合舉辦深圳市-香港金融科技獎，於十月表揚及嘉獎兩地卓越的金融科技產品及方案；及(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳市金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n香港金管局首席行政員陳德棣先生（中），於香港金管局金融科技日上，與中國銀行保險監督管理委員會主任何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席林 George Lee 博士（右）簽署並交換關於「軟著陸」安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n深圳市-香港金融科技獎電子單張\n\n金管局同時亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及杜拜金融服務管理局簽署了金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新項目、推薦創新企業、資訊交流及專業知識的互換。\n\n香港金管局於十一月進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署諒解備忘錄，共同構建全球貿易互聯互通網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易金融平台（HKTFP）連接起來，以建立跨境區塊鏈技術（DLT）基礎設施，數碼化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、更有效率及更具成本效益。 該網絡將是一個開放平台，未來可讓其他有意參與的司法管轄區參與其中。 預計GTCN將於二零一九年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金管局於二零一六年九月推出的金融科技監察框架（FSS），已升級至FSS 2.0，旨在加速與銀行及科技公司的溝通，以促進新點子及創新的推展。FSS 2.0 的主要新功能如下：\n- 設立金融科技監察聊天室，以便在金融科技項目早期階段向銀行及科技公司提供回饋。\n- 科技公司可透過聊天室尋求回饋，直接接觸FSS，無需經由銀行。\n- 香港金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及保險監理處的示範環境（沙盒）已連結，為跨界金融科技產品的試驗提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，已在金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）中測試了28項新技術產品。其中，14項試點計畫已完成，相關產品隨後已推向市場。\n\n# 銀行服務簡化計劃\n\n為簡化銀行服務，一項「銀行輕鬆辦」計劃已正式啟動，旨在減少阻礙科技創新的監管障礙。目前已成立專責小組，重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠程客戶入職及帳戶維護\n- 線上金融服務\n- 線上資產管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行業\n\n虛擬銀行，不設實體分行，預計將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並帶來手機和數碼銀行的新型客戶體驗。它們亦有助於促進金融普惠，因為它們通常 targeting 零售市場，無論是個人抑或中小企業（SMEs）。香港金融管理局已著手檢討現行的《虛擬銀行牌照指引》，旨在促成虛擬銀行業務在香港的推出。\n\n# 智慧銀行新時代\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金管局去年推出的七項倡議，旨在為香港邁入智慧銀行新時代作準備，是一個涉及金管局各部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為一股不可逆轉的力量，金管局銀行監察執行董事陳家強先生表示，金管局作為監管機構，必須擁抱這個新趨勢，密切關注最新的科技發展，並適時調整監管思維和方法，以將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新的高度。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 呈呈財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於第157頁至243頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2017年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，截至2017年12月31日止，該基金及該集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，在香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）下，均有真實而公平的列報，並且已根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7節首長行政長官的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我已按照行政長官根據《金融管理局條例》第七條發出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我已按照該等準則保持獨立於本集團，並且已按照該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 審核關鍵事項\n\n審計關鍵事項是指，根據我專業判斷，於截至2017年12月31日止年度對財務報表進行審計時，最具重要性的事項。 這些事項是在我對整體財務報表進行審計的背景下，以及在形成對其意見的過程中處理的，我對這些事項不提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資料。該等其他資料包括香港金管局二零一七年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且對此類資訊不表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，評估該等其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯著失實。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣局及投資基金審核委員會審核委員會審核投資基金財務報表的職責\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《流通資金條例》第7節由行政長官發出的指示，作出真實而公平的列報，並就金管局認為為確保財務報表能免受因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤呈報而必要的內部控制負責。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣審查局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會轄下審計小組，負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否免於重大錯誤表示合理確信，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並出具包含我的意見的審計報告。合理確信是一種高度的確信，但並不能保證依照審計委員會審計準則所進行的審計，一定能發現所有存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能源於欺詐或錯誤，且若單獨或總計而言，可能合理預期會影響基於此等財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為審計委員會審計準則框架下的審計一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別並評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行對應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，為我的意見提供依據。因欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，導致未發現重大錯報的風險高於因錯誤導致的風險；\n- 為了設計適當的審計程序，取得與審計相關的內部控制理解，但此目的並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性表示意見；\n- 評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性，以及貨幣機關所做的會計估計及其相關披露的合理性；\n- 得出貨幣機關採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性結論，並根據所取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我須在審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或若此等披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論乃基於在審計報告日之前取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了相關交易和事件；以及\n- 取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息，以提供充分且適當的審計憑證，從而對財務報表表示意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我會向聯絡基金諮詢委員會審核小組匯報事項，包括審計的計劃範圍和時間表，以及重要的審計發現，其中包含我於審計過程中識別到的任何重要的內部監控缺失。\n\n我亦會向聯絡匯豐銀行顧問委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露可能影響我獨立性的所有關係及其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與聯絡滙豐銀行審核委員會審核小委員會有關的事宜，我確定在審核本期財務報表時，最具重要性的事項，並將其視為關鍵審核事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為公開披露該事項會合理預期會產生不利後果，而這些不利後果將會超過公眾利益，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主管\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 主要活動\n\n金管局獲財政司長授權，以匯兑基金監管人身份管理匯兑基金（該基金），並依據《匯兑基金條例》（第66章）的條文執行職責。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被劃分為四個投資組合：支持性投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略性投資組合。根據香港金管局制度，支持性投資組合的資產完全對應香港的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略性投資組合持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，此股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的而收購。營運部門的資料請參閱附注30。\n\n# 重大會計政策\n\n## 2.1 符合聲明\n\n此等財務報表已按照所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，而香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）一詞涵蓋所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發布的詮釋，以及香港公認的會計原則。 本基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「本集團」）採納的重要會計政策概要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本會計期間首次生效或可提前採用。附註3提供有關因首次採納上述發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有）的資料，以適用於本集團於本及過往在本財務報表所反映的會計期間。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n本集團的財務報表包括本集團的財務報表，以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。 主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務已在附註16及17中披露。\n\n財務報表的編製採用歷史成本作為基礎，但以下資產及負債除外，其按公平值列示，具體說明請參閱以下會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定按公平值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告金額。 這些估計及相關假設乃基於經驗及其他被認為在當時情況下合理的事項，其結果構成了評估資產及負債賬面值（而這些賬面值並非可從其他來源顯而易見）的依據。 實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續檢討。 若估計調整僅影響當期，則於估計調整期認列相關調整；若調整影響當期及未來期間，則於調整期及未來期間認列相關調整。\n\n附註18 載有關於投資物業公允價值估計的假設資訊。附註36 載有關於金融工具公允價值估計的假設資訊。除了涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，在應用本集團的會計政策方面，沒有其他重大的會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及少數權益\n\n子公司是指被本集團控制的實體。本集團若能從其與該實體的參與中獲得變動回報，並且具備透過對該實體的控制權來影響該等回報的能力，則被視為控制該實體。在評估本集團是否具備控制權時，僅考慮本集團及其他方所持有的實質性權益。\n"}
