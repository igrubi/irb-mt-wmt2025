{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

the Hong Kong Monetary Authority faced challenges head-on in a complex external environment. Within the year, regional military conflicts continued, many countries held important elections, and the global economy’s trajectory remained unclear, leading to continued volatility in world tensions. However, decision-makers around the world sought a proper balance between controlling rising inflation and support economic development, promote robust growth in major economies. Furthermore, as the US launched its first interest rate cut in four years, together with a series of policies supporting the Mainland economy, market sentiment became more optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remain challenging.\n\nFacing a complex situation, our strategy is to continue fully leveraging Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business, fintech, and green and sustainable financial centre role and unique advantages, continuously consolidating Hong Kong’s leading status as an international financial centre. In 2024, the HKMA has made significant progress in these key areas. A number of activities and plans, including the annual Investment Summit, have been well-received, fully showcasing the international community’s steadfast confidence in Hong Kong’s prospects for financial development.\n\nFacing Hong Kong’s cyclical adjustment and structural transformation, we are working closely with the banking sector, strengthening support for SMEs, alleviating corporate repayment burden in an environment of high interest rates, and simultaneously supporting their continued development. Together with the multiple policy measures launched by the Central and Hong Kong SAR Government, Hong Kong’s economy has achieved a stable recovery. In 2024, Hong Kong’s economy recorded moderate growth of 2.5%.\n\n踏入2025年，global economies continue to face numerous uncertainties in a further trend of geopolitical politics. Trade protection and increasing tariffs will lead to disruptions in supply chains, further geopolitical economic tensions, and introduce additional variables to global prospects. If geopolitical tensions heat up further, it may create a double impact on the real economy and Financial markets.\n\nFacing a complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, earnestly fulfill our responsibilities, and strive to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and banking sector stability, and continue to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. We will deepen linkages with market participants, actively promote development in emerging areas, and ensure Hong Kong maintains a leading advantage in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Link exchange rate system: resilient cornerstone\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) implemented over the years has consistently been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, successfully withstanding various economic and policy rates challenges and demonstrating resilient strength.\n\nAlthough the US monetary policy in 2024 is full of challenging environment, the Hong Kong dollar market continues to run smoothly according to the Linked Exchange Rate system mechanism. During the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated on the exchange range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, slightly weakened in the first four months due to moderating liquidity, subsequently strengthened, and approached the strong-side Convertibility Assurance level at the end of the year. The stability of the exchange rate reflect the confidence of the market in the Linked Exchange Rate system. At the same time, the Linked Exchange Rate system continue to maintain a high degree of authorization from international organisations and the financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the Linked Exchange system is based on our continued proactive explanation to the public of the operations mechanism and advantages of the Linked Exchange system, as well as rigorous market monitoring work. Through the collection of detailed data, combined with advanced data analysis and Artificial Intelligence technology, we assess the market more timely and comprehensively and evaluate financial stability.\n\n# Banking sector: Maintaining resilience under multiple challenges.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s banking sector showcased strong resilience under multiple macroeconomic challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining robust. At the end of the year, local banks’ consolidated total capital ratio reached 21.8%, high above the 8% international minimum requirement. In terms of liquidity, it was also robust, with major banks’ liquidity coverage ratio reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, high above the 100% statutory minimum threshold. Affected by policy rates continuing high, the debt issues of some Mainland real estate enterprises have not been completely moderated, and the soft local commercial real estate market, the ratio of classified loans rose to 1.96% at the end of the year. Due to banks adhering to prudent credit risk management and maintaining sufficient allocated reserves, overall risks are manageable.\n\nWhile continuously and closely monitoring credit risks, including risks related to residential mortgage loans, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented two rounds of adjustments to countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures on residential mortgage loans in 2024, in response to changing market conditions and risks within the banking sector. Specifically, the maximum mortgage coverage ratio and loan-to-income ratio limit for all residential properties have returned to the levels in place before the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nIn continuing to strengthen bank credit risk management, we also strive to enhance the resilience of banks’ operations and technology, responding to new challenges brought about by increasing reliance on third-party providers. The CrowdStrike global incidents in July last year, for example, highlighted that operational failures in today’s globally interconnected environment can have cascading and severe consequences. Although the incidents had a limited impact on Hong Kong’s banking sector, they reflect our need to ensure banks establish a robust framework that can maintain critical operations even in severe situations. Encouragingly, all banks in Hong Kong have established operational resilience frameworks and have already entered the important phase of mapping and scenario testing, ensuring the operations of critical services through identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.\n\nAt the same time, to respond to more cyber threats, last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority focused on strengthening the banking sector’s cyber resilience, including issuing new guidelines, conducting dedicated due diligence. We and local other financial supervisory institutions are to collaborate to push forward the cross-sectoral “Cyber Mapping” project, assess and respond to the systemic cyber risks arising from linkages among corporate institutions, markets infrastructure and technology-related services providing. Following complete trial in 2024, the project will be fully launched this year.\n\nTechnology development brings another significant challenge: financial scams threats are constantly upgrading and methods are increasingly complex, requiring banks, supervisory institutions, law enforcement agencies, and the public to work together to combat. We have already requested banks to further strengthen online banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Anti-Money Laundering and Scams Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group) also expanded its scope to cover all major retail banks and six Stored Value Facility Payment tool licensed institutions, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of intelligence sharing, and confiscation of criminal proceeds increased thereby. At the same time, consultation on legislative changes to promote information sharing between banks has received broad support, which will help further enhance banks’ ability to detect and prevent financial crime.\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並 launched 《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入 more 參與機構，以擴大約章的 protection scope，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供 additional protection.\n\nBesides the various measures to prevent scams for customers, we also addressed the possibility of customers impulsively over-borrowing. Last year, we required retail banks to provide at least a seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully consider and assess their financial responsibility and repayment ability after signing a loan agreement. Meanwhile, the “Credit Information Sharing” personal data infrastructure project was successfully launched last year, achieving important progress in enhancing consumer credit reference services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, a key work priority for 2024 is to ensure credit supplies to support the real economy, which is particularly important for SMEs, an anchor of Hong Kong’s economy. Last year, we jointly launched the “9+5” support measures with the banking sector to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing to deal with working capital needs and to support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have already committed not to require early repayment from mortgage customers who are making timely payments, and not to lower credit limits solely based on a decline in collateral value. As at now, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loans, involving a total credit amount of approximately 950 billion Hong Kong dollars. Banks have also earmarked about 3900 billion Hong Kong dollars of dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support the continued development of SMEs in a changing market environment. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks jointly established a Taskforce for SME Financing, providing support to SMEs from specific cases and the overall industry level. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic prospects, we introduced three further support measures targeting specific industries in April 2025, further strengthening support for SMEs in various sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall economic development of Hong Kong.\n\nIn maintaining banking sector stability and enhancing its operations, we continue to promote the application of technology in the banking sector and actively accelerate the adoption of financial technology by banks. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have already applied financial technology to day-to-day operations. Furthermore, given the potential of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening risk management for the banking sector, preventing scam, and enhancing customer experience, the HKMA and Cyberport collaborated last year to launch the “GenAI Sandbox,” encouraging banks to apply GenAI under responsible premises. We have also issued guidance to banks, clearly requiring that if they adopt GenAI in customer-facing services, they must ensure customers receive adequate protection. In addition, we are actively utilizing Artificial Intelligence technology internally to enhance analysis and supervisory efficiency. Beyond GenAI, we are also promoting innovation and development of the financial technology ecosystem through the launch of a new Fintech series of activities, the establishment of a matching platform “FintechConnect,” and the organization of a series of cross-sectoral engagement activities.\n\n# Consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.\n\nDespite 2024 being full of challenge(s) and uncertainty, Hong Kong still maintains its leading status as an international financial centre, further enhancing and expanding in various areas and international influence.\n\nHong Kong, as an important bridge connecting Mainland China and international markets, plays a unique role. Through launched various measures and strengthening collaboration with all parties, Hong Kong continuously enhances its status as a regional fintech and sustainable finance hub. For further details on our work in green and sustainable finance, see the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# RMB business grew rapidly, deepen collaboration with Mainland financial cooperation.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s Renminbi business continued to maintain robust growth momentum, recording significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly offshore bank loans. The Renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement clearing system achieved a historical new high in daily transaction amount, reaching 3.1 billion Renminbi, reflecting a more prominent role for Hong Kong as a hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nAt the same time, we are continuously deepening financial connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland China. The “three linkages, three facilitations” policy launched in 2024, together with the six new measures announced earlier this year, have achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among them, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a RMB trade finance liquidity facility of HK$ billion, providing banks with stable and cost-effective funding sources to expand Renminbi trade finance services, thereby supporting the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through the Northbound Bond Connect as eligible collateral for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s RMB liquidity facility, Hong Kong’s offshore clearing houses, and offshore Renminbi repurchase businesses. This innovative measure enhances the attractiveness of onshore bonds to offshore investors and helps promote greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. Last year, we also launched “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect 2.0,” achieving multifaceted upgrades and enhancements, including providing a more diversified range of investment products, more agile sales and promotion arrangements, and expanding individual investment quotas. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a global hub for offshore renminbi business but also further strengthen our role as an important gateway connecting Mainland and international markets.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

environment\n\nHong Kong’s economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a turnaround in merchandise exports benefiting from improved external demand and the rebound of the global technology cycle. The labour market remained resilient, and inflation maintained a moderate level amid further decline in external price pressures. The Hong Kong stock market rebounded significantly, while the property market was largely soft due to pressures in a continued high interest rates environment. Given the ongoing escalation of trade tensions, it is expected that Hong Kong’s economy will face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, proactive economic stimulus measures launched by mainland China, together with multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, are expected to consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international cooperation and collaboration, and deepen regional cooperation.\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient, and both capital and liquidity are robust. Overall asset quality remains manageable.\n\n# Currency stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and currency market continue to remain smooth and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, and then strengthened for the rest of the year. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated resilience in withstanding external shocks.\n\n# banking sector stability\n\nThe Monetary Authority swiftly launched measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based supervisory regulation and contingency planning, protect the banking sector’s stability. It also provides regulatory guidance and support for the industry to respond to new risks, in order to enhance the robustness and resilience of banking operations and cyber defenses. To encourage the application of financial technology, the Monetary Authority has rolled out a series of bank-to-bank projects, including a “Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox”.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has launched the \"Protection of Consumers from Scams Charter 2.0,\" \"WiseSave,\" and a cooling-off period related to unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks, to enhance consumer protection. Furthermore, the Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence in customer-facing services, and offers multiple payment arrangements and closely collaborates with the industry regarding secondary property transactions. The Monetary Authority has also issued guidelines related to digital asset activities, optimised the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme, and relaxes several restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit reference services to \"Credit Bureau Connect.\"\n\nThe HKMA plays an important role in Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and combating the financing of terrorism system. Through strengthening the public-private partnership platform’s intelligence exchange and collaboration, the volume of suspicious transaction reporting has significantly increased, thereby enabling more effective confiscation of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legislative changes to promote banks’ sharing of information has received broad support and increases further assistance in detecting and preventing financial crime. Furthermore, the HKMA provides guidance to banks on applying Artificial Intelligence for monitoring suspicious activity and prevent and disrupt authorised payment scams, and enhances the “suspicious account alert” mechanism.\n\nThe HKMA has made good progress in Hong Kong’s implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure etc. Furthermore, various areas of the Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe Monetary Authority continues to push forward work to ensure a credible resolution mechanism with counterparties, implement resolution standards, require banks to update their financial contracts, and reduce disorderly risk of early termination during resolution. Furthermore, the Monetary Authority has made significant progress in determining banks’ preferred resolution strategies, dealing with resolvability barriers, and enhancing execution capabilities.\n\n# Hong Kong’s international financial centre status\n\nThe HKMA, in co-operation with Mainland and Hong Kong authorities, has launched a range of measures to jointly deepen and expand the connectivity between Hong Kong’s and Mainland financial markets, including enhancements to “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect”; expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Bond Connect transactions; and optimising Northbound Bond Connect. These measures will underpin Hong Kong’s gateway role and reinforce the city’s status as a hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in bolstering Hong Kong’s financial platform’s competitiveness, covering bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres, etc. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach work to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders, so that everyone can fully recognise the soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third Investment Summit and various other successful events have not only helped enhance Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also created a positive ripple effect. Furthermore, the HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and supervisory organisations, continuing to contribute to the global work of maintaining financial stability and promote financial market development.\n\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in all areas of the \"Financial Technology 2025\" strategy, including central banks' digital currency and data infrastructure. Meanwhile, the HKMA is working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the implementation of Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System and Mainland online payment bank-to-bank clearing system linkage, to achieve cross-border payments.\n\n# Reserves management\n\n2024 global financial markets generally performed well, with major economies recording stable growth, and major central banks also lowered policy rates successively as inflation gradually moderated. In this background, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\nThe Monetary Authority continues strives to promote diversification and responsible investment. At the same time, the long-term growth Portfolio has an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception.\n\n# corporate functions\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close linkages with the public and markets through various channels, enhancing understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the Monetary Authority strives to build a workforce that is agile, responsive, and professional, while maintaining strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities, to respond to changing circumstances and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

{"zh":"# 2025 年工作重點及前瞻\n\n2025年環球經濟前景仍然不明朗，美國的經濟與貿易政策存在顯著的不確定性，加上美國通脹面對上行風險，以致市場憂慮美國政策利率的未來走向。與此同時，在中國內地公布及陸續推出經濟刺激措施後，內地與香港的市場氣氛改善，而政府推出的各項相關支持措施應可令訪港旅遊業進一步改善。香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局將繼續致力促進香港金融體系及基建的穩定與健全。面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，我們會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，我們會積極把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港的國際金融中心地位。我們會繼續謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 金融體系穩定健全\n\n在新一屆美國政府下，政策走向難以預料，並引致地緣經濟碎片化，因此預期全球經濟不明朗的情況應會在2025年持續。金管局肩負促進香港金融體系穩定健全的重任，將繼續提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，確保能掌握最新發展，並作好準備隨時為香港經濟提供支援。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n展望2025年，鑑於宏觀經濟環境不明朗，環球金融市場或會出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。我們亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，並評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n宏觀經濟環境的不確定性很可能會對銀行體系帶來挑戰。與此同時，數碼化的持續發展及生成式人工智能(GenAI)等創新科技的應用，既帶來眾多好處，亦不免為銀行增添新的業務操作與科技風險。面對上述環境，金管局將致力於透過提供政策與實務指引，以及與個別銀行以至整體業界的持續監管聯繫與溝通，進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會因應科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準與最佳做法，繼續加強及改進銀行規管架構與監管模式。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在信貸環境面臨壓力下，金管局將繼續重點監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估它們的信用風險管理手法的成效，特別是涉及貸款分類與撥備，以及問題貸款管理等範疇。同時，我們會與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，並鼓勵認可機構在維持審慎信用風險管理的首要原則下，繼續支持實體經濟。\n\n主要先進經濟體利率前景不明朗及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫，致使環球金融市場更趨波動，有見及此，金管局會繼續採取主動，監管認可機構的市場風險管理。因應宏觀經濟環境不明朗，以及銀行服務日益數碼化，我們亦會審視認可機構如何管理流動性風險，以加強它們應付突發性資金流的能力。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n金管局會繼續其提升銀行體系整體運作穩健性的工作，審視銀行在識別維持關鍵運作的潛在風險並作出補救方面的進度，以作為其實施運作穩健性架構的其中一部分。\n\n鑑於銀行業日益倚賴第三方服務供應商，金管局會進一步加強銀行對第三方風險的管理，制定新指引以實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所制定的相關國際標準。\n\n在網絡防衛韌性方面，金管局會透過跨界別的「網絡地圖」項目評估系統性網絡風險。該項目正由金管局聯同其他本地金融監管機構按照國際貨幣基金組織的建議共同推進。此外，我們將審視銀行實施「穩固三重數據備份」安排的情況及推出網絡防衛韌性測試框架，以推動銀行加強在遇到嚴峻網絡事故時恢復關鍵運作的能力。\n\n儘管我們留意到銀行業更廣泛採用GenAI等高端技術所帶來的好處，但亦會保持警覺，留意新生風險，並按需要就相關技術的運用提供指引。\n\n我們亦會與業界及其他相關持份者合作，保持機動應對，防患未然，以提升銀行打擊數碼詐騙及防範千變萬化的詐騙手法的能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2025年，金管局將推出制度改革、創新及其他措施，以提升香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈的整體能力、減低來自非法資金流的威脅，以及與最新的國際標準及最佳做法看齊。\n\n作為政府跨部門合作的一部分，我們將協助進行第三次香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的全面評估，以加深對科技發展所帶來的潛在弱點的了解，並根據評估結果制定有效且適度的指引，以配合新的穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。\n\n我們將會繼續在能帶來公眾價值的領域帶領及推廣負責任地應用科技，包括人工智能。相關工作包括加強可疑活動監察，讓銀行能識別及制止更多詐騙及傀儡戶口，從而進一步增加向執法機構提交的優質及有助作出跟進的情報。\n\n為加強打擊詐騙和其他金融罪行的力度，我們將提出所需的法例修訂建議，為銀行間分享個人戶口的訊息創造必要的途徑與保障。為加強偵測非法資金流的速度與數量，金管局將展開有關支付數據分析平台的工作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n在2025年，金管局會就認可機構在證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的操守進行現場及非現場審查。我們會重點留意高收益複雜產品、數碼資產及相關投資產品、「跨境理財通」業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，按需要就銷售證券、投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。為促進數碼資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，我們會繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為數碼資產行業制定穩健、周全和平衡的監管架構。\n\n此外，金管局會促進及監察業界實施「跨境理財通」優化措施的情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局聯繫，以進一步優化該計劃及其他銀行相關的跨境項目。\n\n我們亦會按需要整合及釐清有關財富管理及強積金相關業務的現行指引，讓業界更容易掌握金管局的監管規定，便利遵守。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案於2025年1月1日在香港生效。金管局將就最終改革方案在詮釋方面的常見問題持續向認可機構提供指引並加以釐清，以確保業界一致地採納該方案。\n\n巴塞爾委員會在2022年12月發出銀行審慎處理加密資產風險承擔的新標準，再於2024年7月發出具針對性修訂，進一步釐清穩定幣得到優惠監管待遇的準則。同時，巴塞爾委員會亦發表題為「加密資產風險承擔的披露」的文件，列載更新的加密資產風險承擔披露規定。為於香港實施相關標準，金管局會研究可能需要對《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）規則》、《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（《風險承擔限度規則》）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》等各套規則作出的法例修訂。金管局亦會因應實施經驗及業界回饋，對《風險承擔限度規則》提出若干優化建議。金管局將於2025年上半年就修訂進行法定諮詢，以能按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2026年1月1日實施新標準。金管局亦會制定相關銀行業申報表及輔助指引，以便利認可機構實施新標準。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為緊貼最新國際標準、監管方法及銀行業的發展，金管局計劃更新多個《監管政策手冊》單元，包括CA-G-5「監管審查程序」、CA-B-2「具系統重要性銀行」、IC-5「壓力測試」、IR-1「銀行帳內的利率風險」及IC-3「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」。《監管政策手冊》單元CR-G-13「對手方信用風險管理」會作出修訂，以反映巴塞爾委員會在2024年12月發出的「對手方信用風險管理指引」提出的穩健做法。\n\n# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\n\n巴塞爾委員會於2024年4月發出經修訂的《有效監管銀行業的主要原則》（《主要原則》）。經修訂《主要原則》反映自對上一次在2012年進行修訂以來監管與規管方面的發展，以及最近的結構性趨勢對銀行與銀行體系的影響。金管局將於2025年進行詳盡的自我評估，以確保其監管及規管架構符合經修訂《主要原則》。\n\n# 會計準則\n\n國際會計準則理事會計劃在2025年就動態風險管理(Dynamic Risk Management)發出徵求意見稿。金管局將與其他有關當局合作，就建議的動態風險管理會計模型對現行審慎監管規定的影響作出研究。\n\n# 執法\n\n金管局在2024年就擴大金融管理專員的調查及執法權力的建議諮詢銀行業，以確保他仍具備必要權力有效履行在《銀行業條例》下的職能。經考慮在諮詢中收到的意見後，金管局將調整有關建議，並制定必要的法例修訂，以進一步諮詢各持份者。\n\n# 處置機制\n\n金管局正繼續推行為期多年的項目，以建立運作暢順的認可機構處置機制。在2025年，金管局優先進行以下範疇的工作（表1）：\n\n表1

economic prospects for 2025 remain unclear, and the US economy and trade policy present significant uncertainties. Together with US inflation facing upward risks, markets are concerned about the future direction of US policy rates. At the same time, following the announcement and subsequent rollout of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, the market atmosphere in Mainland and Hong Kong has improved, and the various related support measures launched by the Government should promote further improvement in Hong Kong tourism. Hong Kong’s financial system, backed by the resilient resilience and buffers established over the years, has adequate capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strives to promote Hong Kong’s financial system(s) and infrastructure stability and integrity. Facing the uncertain macro economic environment, we will remain vigilant, seek to rapidly identify risks emerging, and respond to them agilely. At the same time, we will actively capture opportunities and create policy space, further enhance Hong Kong’s Financial Centre status. We will continue to manage foreign exchange fund(s) prudently and agilely. We will provide appropriate defensive arrangements and maintain high liquidity, also continue to diversify investment, strives to enhance the long-term investment return of the foreign exchange fund, ensure that the fund can continue effectively maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Financial system stability and soundness.\n\nUnder the new United States Government, policy direction is difficult to predict, and this leads to geopolitical economic fragmentation. Therefore, it is expected that the situation of global economic uncertainty will continue in 2025. The HKMA bears the important responsibility to promote the integrity and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system, will continue to raise vigilance, prevent various potential risks, ensure it can grasp the latest developments, and prepare to provide support for Hong Kong’s economy.\n\n# Be vigilant about potential risks.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global markets will likely experience volatility. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, with the resilience and buffers developed over the years, has adequate ability to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the ability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely assess local and external environment risks and destabilizing factors, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and financial system. We will also study matters that have an impact on Hong Kong’s economy and evaluate the potential risks related to these matters.\n\n# Maintain stability in the banking sector.\n\nMacroeconomic environment uncertainty will likely bring challenges to the banking sector. At the same time, the continued development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) not only bring numerous benefits but also inevitably add new business operations and technology risks for banks. Facing the above environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strive to enhance the resilience of banks to withstand various shocks through providing policy and expertise guidance, and through continued supervisory linkages and communications with individual banks as well as the industry as a whole. Simultaneously, we will continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory framework and regulatory model in response to technological developments, changing customer expectations, and international standards and practices.\n\n# Risk-based supervisory regulation.\n\n# Credit, liquidity, and market risks\n\nUnder pressure in the credit environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to prioritize monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions, and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management methods, particularly involving loan classification and provisions, as well as the management of problem loans. At the same time, we will maintain closely communications with the banking sector and business, and encourage authorized institutions to continue support the real economy under the core principles of maintaining prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe prospects for policy rates in major advanced economies are uncertain and geopolitical tensions heat up, leading to more volatility in global financial markets. In response to this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to take the initiative, managing the market risks of authorized institutions. Following the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitalization of banking services, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risks, to strengthen their ability to handle sudden capital.\n\n# Business operations and technology risks\n\nThe Monetary Authority will continue its work to enhance the resilience of the banking sector’s overall operations, reviewing banks’ progress in identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations and provide remedies, as part of implementing its framework for financial stability risks.\n\nGiven that the banking sector is increasingly reliant on third-party service providers, the supervisory authority are to further strengthen banks’ risk management of third parties, and develop new guidelines to implement the related international standards set out by the Basel Committee (Basel Committee).\n\nIn terms of cyber resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will assess systemic cyber risks of systems through a cross-sectoral “Cyber Mapping” project. The project is being driven by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority together with other local financial supervisory institutions in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. Furthermore, we will evaluate the situation regarding banks implementing “stable triple data backup” arrangements and roll out a cyber resilience testing framework to promote banks' ability to recover critical operations when facing severe security incidents.\n\nAlthough we keep itself informed of the benefits brought by the banking sector’s further adoption of GenAI and other high technologies, we will also remain vigilant, closely monitor new risks, and provide guidelines on the use of related technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other related stakeholders, respond to challenges, prevent problems, in order to enhance banks' capabilities to combat digital scams and deal with the resilience of 10,000 ever-changing scam methods.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-terrorism financing.\n\nIn 2025, Hong Kong’s monetary authority will launched a system reform, innovation and other measures to enhance the overall resilience of Hong Kong’s ecosystem for Anti-Money Laundering and terrorism Financing, reduce threats from illegal funds flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of Government co-operation across departments, we will support implementing the third assessment of Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and terrorist Financing risks, to enhance understanding of the potential weaknesses brought about by technology development, and to set out effective and proportionate guidelines based on the assessment results, in order to adapt to the implementation of the new Currency regulatory regime for issuers.\n\nWe will continue in areas that bring public value to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including Artificial Intelligence. Related work includes strengthening monitoring of suspicious activity, so that banks can identify and disrupt more scams and fraud and Account, thereby further increase submission of high-quality intelligence that help provide follow-up.\n\nTo strengthen Anti-scams and other financial crime efforts, we will propose necessary legislative changes recommendations to create a necessary path and protection for banks to share Account information in between. To strengthen the speed and volume of detecting illegal capital, the Financial regulator will launch work on a related Payment data analysis platform.\n\n# Wealth management and business related to Mandatory provident funds.\n\nIn 2025, the Monetary Authority will conduct on-site and non-site due diligence of authorized institutions’ conduct in relation to Securities, investment products, depository, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related business. We will closely monitor high gains complex products, digital asset(s) and related products, “Wealth Management Connect” business, digital distribution and consultation platform(s), long-term insurance products and premium financing business, and will taking into account market latest developments and international standards’ legislative changes.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also closely link with other supervisory institutions and the banking sector, providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investments, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital asset industry, We will continue to collaborate with Government and other regulatory institutions to ensure a robust, comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.\n\nFurthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will promote and monitor the implementation of enhancements to \"Wealth Management Connect\" measures, and will continue to engage with the industry and relevant supervisory authorities to further enhance the Scheme and other cross-border projects related to banks.\n\nWe will also, as needed, harmonise and clarify the current guidelines related to wealth management and occupational retirement scheme related business, so that industry practitioners can easily understand the supervisory regulations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and maintain compliance.\n\n# formulate policy\n\n# Implementing Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe Basel III reform package will take effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The HKMA will continue to provide guidance and harmonise common questions regarding the interpretation of the reform package to authorized institutions, ensuring consistent adoption of the solution by the industry.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards for prudential treatment of crypto asset risk exposures in December 2022, and further issued targeted amendments in July 2024 to clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. Simultaneously, the Basel Committee also published a document titled \"Disclosure of Crypto Asset Risk Exposures,\" setting out updated regulations for disclosure of crypto asset risk exposures. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, HKMA will study the legislative amendments that may need to be made to various sets of rules, including the Banking (Capital) Rules, the Banking (Disclosure) Rules, the Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules (\"Risk Exposure Limits Rules\"), and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules. HKMA will also propose several optimisation recommendations for the \"Risk Exposure Limits Rules\" based on implementation experience and industry feedback. HKMA will conduct statutory consultation on the amendments in the first half of 2025, to enable implementation of the new standards by January 1, 2026, in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timeline. HKMA will also develop relevant banking sector reporting forms and supportive guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the new standards by authorized institutions.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo align with the latest international standards, supervisory methods, and development of the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plans to update several modules of the “Regulatory Policy Manual”, including CA-G-5 “Supervisory Review Procedures”, CA-B-2 “Systemically Important Banks”, IC-5 “Stress Testing”, IR-1 “Interest Rate Risk in Banks’ Books” and IC-3 “Submission of Reports by External Auditors of Authorized Institutions under the Banking Ordinance”. The module CR-G-13 “Counterparty Credit Risk Management” of the “Regulatory Policy Manual” will be revised to reflect the robust practices proposed in the “Guidance on Counterparty Credit Risk Management” issued by the Basel Committee in December 2024.\n\n# The key supervisory principles for the Basel Committee’s banking sector\n\nBasel Committee provides the revised 《Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision》（《Core Principles》）in April 2024. The revised 《Core Principles》reflects developments in supervisory regulation since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and banking sector. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a detailed self assessment in 2025 to ensure its supervisory regulation framework meets the revised 《Core Principles》。\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nInternational Accounting Standards Board Plan will in 2025 provide issuing a consultation draft on Dynamic Risk Management.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有四項：\n\n- 在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；\n- 協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持及發展香港的金融基建；及\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授予金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全（惟同時須顧及外匯基金的主要目的），藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》訂明金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。金融管理專員獲賦予一系列權力，對不可持續經營的銀行界實體進行有秩序處置（有關實體倒閉可能構成系統性風險），以維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n保險業監管局根據《保險業條例》就銀行的保險相關業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》授權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例下有關客戶盡職審查及備存紀錄的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付的持牌銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察某些重要的結算及交收系統，以及在香港營運的零售支付系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理用作儲存金錢價值並符合該條例指明準則的電子及實物「工具」的發牌制度。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n\n- 建立了一套清晰的機構管治架構；\n- 維持高問責性及透明度，並與各持份者保持緊密聯繫；及\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準。\n\n金管局的管治架構涵蓋幾個主要部分，包括給予意見和指導的各法定諮詢委員會、問責性與透明度，以及內部監控與外部審計。\n\n# 金管局與特區政府\n\n金管局是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及管理層\n\n# 諮詢委員會\n\n諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》成立，就與財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權相關的事宜向其提供意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員各以本身的專業知識及經驗獲得委任，使外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下設有五個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定範疇的工作和給予意見，並透過諮詢委員會向財政政司長報告及提出建議。有關外匯基金諮詢委員會及其轄下五個專責委員會的詳情，請參閱第53至63頁。\n\n銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會就有關《銀行業條例》，特別是有關銀行、接受存款公司及有限制牌照銀行經營銀行業務或接受存款業務（視屬何情況而定）的事宜，向香港特別行政區行政長官提供意見。兩個委員會均由財政司司長擔任主席，成員包括金融管理專員及財政司司長根據行政長官的授權而委任的人士。有關銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會的詳情，請參閱第64至65頁。\n\n# 管理層\n\n總裁委員會由金管局總裁、副總裁及其他高層人員組成，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。總裁委員會定期開會，向總裁匯報金管局各部門主要工作的進度，並就與金管局運作有關的政策事項向總裁提供意見。有關總裁委員會成員名單，請參閱第66至67頁。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n# 與公眾溝通\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局亦盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項，尤其透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n此外，金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放六日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能一章（第185至191頁）。\n\n# 立法會\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年三次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。金管局總裁定期在財經事務委員會作出的簡報載於金管局網站。\n\n此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 資訊披露\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演講辭及簡報會資料文件。\n\n金管局不時檢討外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的披露是否足夠。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n# 內部監控與外部審計\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和匯報各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

Authority, as Hong Kong’s central bank institutions, fully understands the importance of good governance for maintaining and upholding public confidence in the HKMA fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, and therefore continues its efforts to uphold high standards of corporate governance.\n\nTo facilitate the commitment to good corporate governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\nDeveloped a well-defined corporate governance framework;\nMaintaining high accountability and transparency, and in co-operation with stakeholders, maintaining closely linked relations; and\nImplementing robust controls measures to manage risk(s), and ensure all staff at all levels’ behaviours and their day-to-day operations meet specified standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s governance framework covers several key measures, including Advisory Committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audit.\n\n# The HKMA and SAR government\n\nThe Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (SAR Government) framework, but can hire staff with different employment terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority and its staff are all People’s staff. The day-to-day operations of the Monetary Authority are highly autonomous within the scope of powers vested or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objective and monetary structure: in letters from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority on June 25, 2003, it provides that stability shall be maintained through the currency issuance system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate around 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible on his own to achieve the monetary policy objective, including deciding related strategy, tools, and method, and has responsibility for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau Director, has responsibility for maintaining Hong Kong’s financial system's stability and integrity, as well as maintaining Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority’s mandate includes:\n\n- Promote the overall stability and effective operations of the banking sector;\n- Collaborate with other related institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;\n- Handle matters related to the issuance and circulation of statutory banknotes and coins;\n- Through development of Payment, clearing and settlement systems, and being responsible for operating related systems where appropriate, promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure; and\n- Collaborate with other related institutions and organisations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, and implement appropriate market development measures to assist in strengthening Hong Kong’s international competitiveness.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority shall, according to the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary, be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Advisory Committees and management.\n\n# Advisory Committee\n\nAdvisory Committees provide advice and guidance on the Financial Services and Markets Authority’s main areas of work.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Bill, to provide advice to the Financial Secretary on matters related to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex-officio Chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary on authority from the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in a personal capacity. The members are appointed based on their professional knowledge and experience, to effect broad benefits for the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, there are five specialist committees responsible for monitoring the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in sector-specific areas and providing advice, and for reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Advisory Committee. For further details on the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five specialist committees, see pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Banking Business Advisory Committees and Deposit-taking Companies Advisory Committee provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region regarding the Banking Ordinance, particularly matters related to banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted license banks operating banking business or taking deposits (depending on the situation). Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, and members include the Monetary Authority and individuals appointed by the Chief Executive’s empowering authorization. For further details on the Banking Business Advisory Committee and Deposit-taking Companies Advisory Committee, see pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management\n\nThe Chief Executive Committee is composed of the Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Deputy Chief Executive, and other high-level staff, and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority serves as Chairman. The Chief Executive Committee will regularly launch meetings, report to the Chief Executive on the progress of the main work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s departments, and provide advice to the Chief Executive on related policy issues concerning the operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. See pages 66 to 67 for the list of Chief Executive Committee members.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nRegarding the methods adopted for day-to-day operations and implementing Government objectives, the Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy, and is complemented by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has responsibility to the public through the Financial Secretary; and because the powers of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are determined by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has responsibility to the public through the Legislative Council. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also recognises itself as bearing a more extensive responsibility, to promote public understanding of the Monetary Authority’s role and objectives, and to closely monitor issues of concern to personnel. In its execution of day-to-day work and maintaining broad linkages with society, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority steadfastly strives to enhance transparency and maintain open policies. This policy has two objectives:\n\n- In ensuring the financial community and the public have a full understanding of the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while taking into consideration the statutory limits on disclosure of commercial confidentiality and confidential data; and\n- ensure that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains in touch with the pulse of society and provide an appropriate response to public opinion.\n\n# Communicate with the Public\n\nThe HKMA strives to promote monetary and banking sector stability, effectively manage official Reserves, develop and monitor resilient and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s international financial centre status and promote Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nThe Monetary Authority shall effectively fulfill its responsibilities by gaining the trust of personnel. Therefore, the Monetary Authority, with a rigorous attitude, fulfills its responsibility to communicate its policies and work to the public. The Monetary Authority maintains extensive contacts with media and leverage social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital era. The Monetary Authority also strives to handle issues involving the Monetary Authority’s scope of responsibilities that are of significant public concern, particularly through traditional and social media to clarify inaccurate information and rumors related to Monetary Authority policies.\n\n此外，金管局辦事處 equipped with an Information Centre, is divided into a library and an exhibition area, open to the public six days a week for visiting and use. See chapter \"Functions of corporate institutions\" (pages 185 to 191) for more details related to the work of communications and linkages between the 金管局 and the public.\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the Monetary Authority and the Legislative Council is very important for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority has promised to provide reports presented to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year, briefing on various work and policies of the Monetary Authority, and answering related questions. Briefings provided by the Chief Executive to the Financial Affairs Committee are published on the Monetary Authority website.\n\nBesides, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly attend Legislative Council Committee and sub-committee meetings to explain and discuss Special matters, and assist Members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information disclosure\n\nhkma strives to achieve international highest standards in transparency, publishing various bilingual journals and special publications. The hkma’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a dedicated session shown economic research, data, supervisory resources, consumer information and other topics, and also carries a large amount of documents from hkma published publications, press releases, speeches and briefing session reports.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority periodically reviews whether the disclosure of the Exchange Fund and Currency Board’s data is adequate. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority participated in the International Monetary Fund’s “Special Data Dissemination Standard” initiative for central bank’s starting in 1999. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also publishes the record of meetings under the Advisory Committees on Currency Board, and the report on the operation of the Currency Board’s system. Since 1996, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website carries banking sector regulatory policy and guidance.\n\n# Internal controls and external audit\n\nThe Monetary Authority adopts resilient and effective controls, ensuring staff conduct with high standards, prudent risk management, and adequate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct offers guidance to staff on ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring the behaviours of all staff at all levels meet specified standards.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operations controls\n\nAs the first line of risk management, all departments and divisions have a responsibility to identify and assess the risks of their work processes, and develop proper controls to ensure the day-to-day operations of the Financial Supervisory Agency are stable.\n\n# Corporate risk management\n\nRisk management also takes place at the corporate level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, serves as one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on the potential and new risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related controls and mitigating strategies are sufficient, and determines appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe HKMA’s internal audit department independently assess the governance procedures, risk management, and control measures of different departments to determine their adequacy and effectiveness, and to issue recommendations for improvement.\n\n# external audit\n\nAccording to section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Hong Kong SAR Government Audit Commission. The Audit Commission does not charge costs for this service. The audited Exchange Fund financial statements are published in the HKMA annual report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的資產質素\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2024年第4季為178.4%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為67.0%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2024年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為143.4%及186.7%（圖14）。以上所有四個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖 13

economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a turnaround in merchandise exports benefiting from improved external demand and the rebound of the global technology cycle. The labour market remained resilient, and inflation maintained a moderate level amid further decline in external price pressures. Hong Kong’s stock market rebounded significantly, while the property market was largely soft due to pressures in a sustained high interest rates environment. Given the continued escalation of trade tensions, it is expected that Hong Kong’s economy will face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, proactive economic stimulus measures launched by mainland China, together with multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, should consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international cooperation and collaboration, and deepen regional cooperation.\n\n# Economic review\n\n# Real-world economic activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy grew moderately in 2024. Real gross domestic product, following a 3.2% increase recorded in 2023, rose year on year by 2.5% in 2024 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Externally, merchandise exports recovered and registered positive growth, supported by providing the impetus of improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle, becoming a major driving force for overall economic growth. Exports of services also continued to grow further, along with the continued recovery of Hong Kong tourism, and cross-boundary financial and fundraising activity significantly increasing in the second half of the year. However, as service imports rose significantly amid continued growth in outbound tourism, they offset the positive effect of service exports on overall economic growth. Locally, private consumption expenditure softened under the changing consumption model of Hong Kong residents. Conversely, increased property transactions and an improvement in the business climate under a gradual relax of monetary conditions drove a slight increase in overall investment expenditure.\n\nMapping 1 shows the contribution of various factors to the growth of real local aggregate.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real Local Gross Value Added Growth (Compared to the Previous Period)\nNote: The aggregate issue size of local fixed capital formation, seasonally adjusted, has unspecified increases or decreases quarter to quarter.\nSources: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and labour markets\n\nAlthough newly signed private residential rental income gradually increases, local cost pressures remain generally manageable, together with outer price pressures gradually decreasing, local inflation in 2024 remains moderate (Chart 2). For the whole year as a whole in 2024, the basic and overall inflation rate were 1.1% and 1.7% respectively.\n\nThe labour market performed resiliently in 2024, with the unemployment rate hovering between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Chart 3). Since the first quarter, the total number of employed people (Chart 3) has steadily increased, and the labour population has also seen an increase, reflecting that labour demand and supply have generally remained stable. At the same time, with the economy continued growth, nominal wages and labour income have both recorded robust growth. Furthermore, the Government announced further enhancements to Hong Kong’s Scheme to attract talent in the 2024 Policy Report, in order to alleviate manpower shortages in different industries and to inject new impetus into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nFigure 2 Basic consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nHong Kong's stock market significantly shifted in 2024, following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, with the US Federal Reserve reducing interest rates and the Mainland launching proactive economic stimulus measures, market sentiment significantly improved, driving the Hang Seng Index to its year-high on October 7th, closing at 23,100 points (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November triggered concerns about global economic prospects and the pace of monetary policy relaxations by the Federal Reserve, causing a slight pullback in Hong Kong's stock market. Nevertheless, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points at the end of the year, a substantial increase of 17.7% compared to the end of 2023, ending a streak of annual declines for four years.\n\n# Property Market\n\nResidential property market was largely soft in the first three months of 2024, but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. Supported by the relaxation of related policy measures in late February and mid-October, and the easing cycle that began in September, whole year residential transactions surged by 23.5% from the record-low of 43,002 transactions in 2023 to 53,099 in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage interest rates and accumulated inventory in the primary market continue to put downward pressure on property prices. Therefore, property prices fell year on year by 7.1%, and affordability also slightly improved, although it remains relatively tight. The non-residential property market remains soft. Among them, the vacancy rate of office buildings remains high in the situation of robust supplies, while retail shops face challenges brought about by the changing consumption model of visitors and local residents.\n\nMapping 4 asset prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong transactions and settlement Limited\n\n# economic prospects\n\n# economic environment\n\nGiven the ongoing trade tensions and the likelihood of disruptions to international trade and capital, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, related authorities and the banking sector continue to provide multifaceted support, which should enhance the resilience of local corporations. Mainland proactively launches economic stimulus measures and achieves significant breakthroughs in emerging technology areas, also bolstering business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and speed up linkages with emerging markets. Simultaneously, with Mainland authorities’ supportive tourism policy for Hong Kong, and the Government’s continued efforts to support Hong Kong’s tourism industry, the tourism sector is expected to grow further.\n\n# Inflation and labour markets\n\nWe expect local inflation to remain moderate in 2025. As rental income increases gradually transmit to consumer prices, local costs may face mild pressure. However, despite the increased uncertainty of global prospects, external price pressures should be moderate. On the other hand, the labour market may face challenges due to heightened trade tensions. However, various talent attraction schemes should help continue to establish a quality talent pool, providing support for long-term economic development.\n\n# banking sector performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient in 2024, with banks’ capital and liquidity both robust. Amid a macroeconomic environment full of (context: challenging... environment), the banking sector faced increasing credit risks during the year, but the overall asset quality remains manageable. Driven by gains from investments held for trading and increasing fee and commission income, retail bank profitability grew further compared to 2023.\n\n# asset quality\n\nThe banking sector’s classified loan ratio increased from 1.57% as at the end of 2023 to 1.96% as at the end of 2024, and the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to lowered ratings of loans to some Mainland real estate developers, as well as local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the sector-specific classified loan ratio of related loans in Mainland China decreased from 2.58% as at the end of 2023 to 2.38% as at the end of 2024. Bank provisions remain sufficient. As at the end of 2024, the bank’s credit loan provisioning coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit loan provisions and classified loans) was about 65%. If the realizable value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the adjusted bank credit loan provisioning coverage ratio is approximately 145%. At the same time, the delinquency ratio of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans as at the end of 2024 remained at a low level, at 0.11% and 0.35% respectively (Figure 6).\n\nMapping 5 banking sector asset quality\nSource: 金管局\n\nFigure 6 Residential mortgage loans and credit card loans delinquency ratio.\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n# Profitability\n\nRetail banking’s overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4%, while the average asset return on equity during the same period rose from 0.88% to 0.93% (Chart 7). Profit growth was primarily due to gains from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and increases in fee and commission income (+15.4%), but part of the increase was offset by a decrease in net interest income (–5.2%). The retail bank’s net interest margin narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Chart 8). At the same time, the retail bank’s cost-to-income ratio edged up from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Chart 9).\n\nCyber Mapping 7 retail banks’ performance\nSource: 金管局\n\nCyber Mapping 8 retail bank’s net interest margin.\nSource: 金管局\n\nCyber Mapping 9 retail bank costs and income ratio.\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector balance sheet expanded 4.3% in 2024, primarily due to increasing tradable instruments (+13.4%). Due to still-high borrowing costs, loan demand was under pressure, and the total loan amount decreased 2.8% in 2024. Among these, loans used in Hong Kong and loans used outside Hong Kong decreased by 2.1% and 5.7%, respectively, while trade finance increased 4.6%. Related loans to Mainland China decreased 8.7% in 2024.\n\nIn terms of asset and liability balance sheet liabilities, the total deposit increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to an increase of 5.1% in 2023. Due to the decrease in the total loan and the increase in the total deposit, the overall loan-deposit ratio decreased from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital sufficient level\n\nThe banking sector’s capital remained robust in 2024. At the end of the year, the consolidated total capital ratio of local incorporated authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% the previous year; the primary capital ratio was 19.9% (Chart 11). Both were well above related international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 of the banking sector’s loans and deposits\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 11: Coverage ratio of consolidated capital of local incorporated authorized institutions.\nSource: Monetary Authority\n\nMapping 12 Local incorporated authorized institutions’ consolidated leverage ratio.\nSource: 金管局\n\n# Liquidity狀況\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity condition maintains stability. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio of category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the liquidity ratio of category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Mapping 13). The core source of funds for the banking sector remains customers’ deposits. At the end of 2024, the net amount of stable funds for category 1 institutions and the core funds ratio for 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7% respectively (Mapping 14).

{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2024年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港銀行業對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔，以及主要先進經濟體的最新貨幣政策實施框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n圖 5

香港鈔票\n\n年內金管局舉辦14場有關香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的講座，吸引超過2,600人參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖收銀員及學生，有助提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 美元流動資金安排\n\n金管局推出美元流動資金安排的優化措施，包括將交收周期由T+1縮短至T+0，於5月24日生效。此項恆常流動資金安排可在持牌銀行有需要時為其提供備用流動性，尤其是在5月28日美國開始實施交收周期縮短至T+1的情況下。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。截至2024年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為13,068億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n在2024年，金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）發表15份對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題的研究論文，並透過五期開放取用電子期刊與全球讀者分享研究成果。研究中心亦出版兩份《Insights from MonetaryResearch》，就其近期發表的研究論文為公眾提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究工作外，研究中心舉辦一系列知識交流活動，促進與不同參與者的聯繫。年內舉辦31場以本地參與者為對象的研討會或網上研討會，探討重要貨幣及金融研究議題。在國際層面，金融學院與研究中心聯同學術機構、各國央行及國際金融機構舉辦四次國際會議及五次研討會或圓桌會議，促進就廣泛經濟及金融事務的對話與交流。\n\n這些國際活動包括：\n\n4月11日\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\n\n6月6至7日 「NBER東亞經濟研討會2024」\n\n與美國全國經濟研究所、國際結算銀行及香港科技大學商學院合辦\n\n7月15至16日\n\n與基金組織、國際結算銀行及東盟與中日韓宏觀經濟研究辦公室合辦\n\n10月14至15日\n\n第14屆年度中國經濟國際研討會—「中國及全球貿易結構的演變：挑戰與機遇」\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

regarding the US monetary policy direction, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and currency market continued to remain smooth and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, and then strengthened for the rest of the year. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong bank interbank rates generally followed the trend of US dollar policy rates, while also being affected by local supply and demand situation. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience to withstand external shocks.\n\n# objective\n\nHong Kong’s monetary policy’s main objective is to maintain currency stability, ensuring the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar is stable, to enable the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market to remain within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. This monetary structure mainly adopts the Exchange Fund system, requiring the US dollar Reserves held by the Exchange Fund to provide support for the monetary foundation of at least 100 percent; if the monetary foundation undergoes change, the US dollar Reserves must also make corresponding increases or decreases, in order to adapt to the changes in the monetary foundation by 100 percent.\n\nCurrency (Table 1) including:\n\n- Certificate(s) of Indebtedness (fully support the bank banknotes issued by three banks);\n- Government issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- Aggregate Balance of the clearing Account established in the Financial Services and Markets Authority; and\n- Bills and Notes of the Exchange Fund issued on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1 Currency foundation\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automated interest rate mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange assurance. When the strong-side (or weak-side) exchange assurance is triggered, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will, at the request of banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and purchase US dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar (or purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at a rate of HK$7.85), to increase (or decrease) the Aggregate Balance, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to drop (or rise), thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange scope of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2024 return\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar weakened slightly as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened, primarily supported by demand related to dividends and active stock market transactions. In early August, concerns about a potential US economic slowdown and expectations of a faster and more substantial interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve triggered unwindings of covered interest arbitrage and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar, driving the Hong Kong dollar to the strong-side of the Convertibility Arrangement. The Hong Kong dollar subsequently strengthened further in late September, benefiting from a surge in stock market transactions in Hong Kong after Mainland China announced a range of economic stimulus measures. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar softened slightly in early November, partly due to a moderation in the gains in the Hong Kong stock market and partly due to the strong performance of the US economy at the time, providing the Federal Open Market Committee space to cautiously lower the Federal fund rate. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded amid year-end seasonal funding demand. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Chart 1).\n\nFigure 1 2024 exchange rate market\n\nDue to does not exchange Convertibility guarantee triggered within the year, Aggregate Balance change was not large, maintaining around 447 billion Hong Kong dollar. At the same time, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds increased slightly from 12,455 billion Hong Kong dollar to 13,839 billion Hong Kong dollar. Therefore, the Aggregate Balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds increased from 12,904 billion Hong Kong dollar at the end of 2023 to 14,287 billion Hong Kong dollar at the end of 2024 (2). Overall monetary foundation still provides fully support from Exchange Fund Reserves.\n\nChart 2 2024 Aggregate Balance (prior to Discount Window activity) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds.\n\n# Currency market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (a linked exchange rate regime), Hong Kong’s interbank offered rate generally follows the US dollar interest rate, with short-dated rates also affected by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations of US policy rates being lowered heat up, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rate broadly softened (Figure 3) during the first eight months of 2024. Driven by seasonal end-of-quarter funding demand and vibrant market activity, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rate tightened in late September, with overnight rates rising above 6 percent at the end of the quarter. Subsequently, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rate largely stabilized, and rose before year-end due to relatively decreased liquidity. For the whole year, overnight, one month, and three month Hong Kong interbank offered rates decreased by 45, 69, and 78 basis points to 5.65 percent, 4.58 percent, and 4.37 percent at year-end, respectively.\n\nFollowing a decrease in the target range of the US Federal Fund rate, policy rates were lowered three times, totalling a one percent (or 100 basis points), from 5.75% to 4.75% (Chart 3). In the retail market, as the US lowered policy rates, multiple banks lowered their best lending rate by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further by 25 basis points and 12.5 basis points in early November and late December respectively. In this situation, the average interest rate on new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, Hong Kong’s currency market continues to operate normally. Borrowing through the Discount Window increased from HK$388 billion in 2023 to HK$500 billion in 2024; the usage of the Discount Window has not shown any abnormality.\n\nFigure 3 2024 Hong Kong interbank offered rate\n\n# linkages exchange rate system\n\nSince 1983, the Linked exchange rate system has been an important anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating strong resilience to challenge(s). Despite the uncertainty surrounding US policy rates and geopolitical economic fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and currency markets have maintained orderly operations, reflecting the Linked exchange rate system’s robust effectiveness. Government also resolutely maintains the Linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund (Fund) repeatedly reiterates in its reporting on external affairs that Hong Kong has a credible set of rules, ample fiscal and external Reserves, prudent financial regulation and supervision, an agile economy, and a prudent financial framework, ensuring the Linked exchange rate system has credible.\n\nA resilient banking sector plays a critical role in the smooth operations of the linked exchange system. Hong Kong’s banking sector continues to operate smoothly, and liquidity and capital conditions are robust according to international standards. To ensure the banking sector’s resilience to withstand shocks, the HKMA has continuously closely monitored banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as testing results, and maintain regulatory regulation of bank loans.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to support the monetary foundation. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary foundation) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the trigger limit of 112.5% (Figure 4), primarily due to interest from investments and revaluation of investments at market prices. Following arrangements approved by the Advisory Committees, assets were allocated from the support portfolio to the investment portfolio, bringing the support ratio down to approximately 110.08% on September 11. Subsequently, the support ratio remained largely stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s ample financial resources, together with Hong Kong’s resilient banking sector, provide a strong and robust backing for protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nCyber Mapping 4 2024 support ratio daily change\n\n# Currency issuing committee\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Currency Board is responsible for monitoring and reviewing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2024, the topics reviewed by the Currency Board included the banking sector’s exposure to risks from non-bank financial institutions, as well as the latest implementation framework of monetary policy in major advanced economies. Meeting records of the Currency Board and the Currency Board operational reports submitted to it by the HKMA are included on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nFigure 5 shows the amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2024, analyzed by issuing bank(s).\n\nFigure 6 2024 year-end circulation of bank banknotes distribution situation\n\nFigure 7 2024 year-end bank banknotes in circulation amount\n\nFigure 8 2024 year-end government issuance of banknotes and coins in circulation amount\n\nChart 9 2024 year-end analysis of government banknotes and coins in circulation.\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA held 14 conclusion related to Hong Kong banknotes design and anti-counterfeiting features, attracted more than 2,600 participants, including bank tellers, retail establishments cashiers and students, help enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coins collection plan\n\nCoins collecting plan continues to be popular with the public. Details related to the plan are included in the \"Sustainable Development of the Monetary Authority\" chapter of the \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\".\n\n# US dollar liquidity arrangements\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched enhancements to the US dollar liquidity facility arrangements, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing liquidity facility can provide banks with backup liquidity when needed, particularly in the situation where the US begins implementing a settlement cycle shortened to T+1 on May 28.\n\n# Foreign exchange fund Bills and Notes and bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds Scheme continues to operate smoothly. As at the end of 2024, the outstanding nominal total of the Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds was about 13,068 billion Hong Kong dollars (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds\n\n# Currency research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Research Centre (Research Centre) under the Academy, responsible for research work, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and within the region, and through five periods of open accessibility, share research achievements with global readers via electronic journals. The Research Centre also published two issues of 《Insights from MonetaryResearch》, providing the public with a high-level, non-technical overview of its recently published research papers.\n\nBesides research work, the Research Centre organised a range of knowledge engagement activities to promote linkages with different participants. During the year, 31 events were held targeting local participants, exploring important monetary and financial research topics. On an international level, the Finance Academy, together with the Research Centre, organised four International Conference events and five workshops or roundtable meetings with academic institutions, central banks, and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on a range of economic and financial affairs.\n\nThese International activities include:\n\nApr 11\n\nco-organise with the HKMA and Hong Kong university\n\nJune 6-7 “NBER East Asian Economic Workshop 2024”\n\nco-host with the US National Institute of Economic Research, International banks, and the Business School of Hong Kong University.\n\nJuly 15 to 16\n\nWith fund organisations, international clearing banks, and the ASEAN and Japan and macroeconomic research office.\n\nOctober 14 to 15\n\nThe 14th Annual International Chinese Economic Conference—\"The Evolution of China and Global Trade Structures: Challenges and Opportunities\"\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表

支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong’s banking sector maintained stability in 2024. The HKMA swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based supervision and contingency planning, provided protection for the banking sector’s stability. It also provided supervisory guidelines and support for the industry to respond to new risks, to enhance the robustness and network defense resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sectoral projects, including a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the \"Protection of Consumers from Scams Charter 2.0\" to enhance consumer protection in banks. We have also launched \"SmartSafe Deposit\" to assist depositors in effectively protecting their deposits, and guidance related to banks’ unsecured consumer credit products’ cooling-off period to mitigate impulsive and excessive borrowing risks. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides banks with guidance on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence in customer-facing services, and offers more payment arrangements for secondary property transactions, working closely with the industry. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also provides guidance on cross-boundary digital asset activities, optimizes the Pilot Scheme for Wealth Management Connect, and streamlines procedures for selling investment and insurance products, enhancing customer experience and ensuring investor protection. Personal credit reference services have been fully transitioned to “Credit Reference Connect” within the year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and combating the financing of terrorism regime. Through increasing the volume and speed of information exchanged via the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, suspicious transaction reporting led by intelligence has increased by 303% compared to 2023, prompting an increase of 34% in criminal proceeds frozen or confiscated. The consultation on legislative changes to promote banks’ sharing of information to assist in detecting and preventing financial crime has received broad support. In April, the HKMA provided guidance based on the thematic review of the transaction monitoring system, and in September launched a Scheme to promote the industry’s application of Artificial Intelligence to monitor suspicious activity. The HKMA also collaborates with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimise the “suspicious account alert” mechanism and strengthen promotional work, and provides guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and disrupting authorised payment scams.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards including capital adequacy and disclosure etc. Hong Kong’s Deposit Protection Committee has enhanced various areas of the Deposit Protection Scheme to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure a credible resolution mechanism with credibility, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implements resolution standards, require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties, and reduce early termination risks during resolution. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in determining banks’ preferred resolution strategies, combatting barriers to resolution resolvability to ensure adequate financial resources and continued operational continuity during resolution, and enhancing execution capabilities.\n\n# objective\n\nThe HKMA’s objective is to promote the stability and maintain the soundness of the banking sector. To achieve this objective, it relies on establishing and maintaining a financial system with a high degree of resilience that can respond to demand and provide critical financial services for Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may be impacted by their operational methods, or even in extreme situations due to disorderly failure, affecting the stability of the financial system. As the supervisory authority, Monetary Authority plays an important role in ensuring financial stability, ensuring banks have the resilience to withstand shocks and respond to crises, to ultimately help prevent failure. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, and authorization of licensed banks, banks with a limit on their license, and Deposit taking companies (collectively named “authorized institutions”).\n\nHong Kong’s prudential supervisory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk”. In fact, as a resolution mechanism authority, the Monetary Authority seeks to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer viable, its failure can be handled in an orderly resolution. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution mechanism authority for authorized institutions. To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to develop a set of rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate barriers to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the operational capacity of the Monetary Authority to dispose of authorized institutions nearing failure. To effectively carry out the above work, the Monetary Authority adopts methods that are consistent with and coordinate international supervisory efforts.\n\nThe Monetary Authority also has responsibility for specified and monitoring certain financial market infrastructure. The primary purpose of HKMA’s monitoring of financial market infrastructure is to promote the overall safety and efficiency of related infrastructure, reduce systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Enhancing the resilience of financial market infrastructure to financial crises can protect Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and avoid impacting its stability due to disruptions in the operations of market infrastructure.\n\n# 2024 return\n\n# Licensing matters\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted bank licenses to a bank established as a corporation in Hong Kong and a bank established outside of Hong Kong as a corporation. The HKMA also approved an external transaction broker to become a monetary broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, a bank with a limit license, and a Deposit taking company.\n\nFor further information is contained related to Hong Kong’s authorized institutions and local offices, see Table D to F, which are included on pages 311 to 314 and pages 320 to 323.\n\n# Reviews of the banking sector’s three-level system\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed the public consultation related to streamlining the banking three-tier system to a two-tier system, and respondents generally support the recommendations. After considering the advice received, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued several new key issues to streamline the transition process and reduce the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# “Virtual bank” rebrands.\n\n此外，金管局 complete related “Virtual Bank” to “Digital Bank” Public consultation. The proposal support was widespread, and the 金管局 subsequently revised the statutory guidance 《認可數字銀行》 in October. The recommendations are officially effective.\n\n# Digital banking reviews\n\nIn another work completed in 2024, a comprehensive review of digital banks was conducted, and the review report was published in August. The review shows that the development of digital banks has already achieved the three policy objectives for introducing digital banks in Hong Kong, namely promote innovation and financial technology, provide new customer experience, and promote widespread finance. Under the diversified development of digital banks and traditional banks, the HKMA believes that the current volume of digital bank licenses is appropriate and that it is not necessary at this stage to introduce more new digital bank participants into the market. Amendments to the guidelines \"Authorization of Digital Banks\" issued in October relax several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking business beyond retail banking, and establishing physical branches where the situation is reasonable from the perspective of customer experience and business strategy, provided that digital banks continue to primarily provide banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of bank license fees.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission completed a review of licensing costs within the year and raised the fee level in June.\n\n# Hong Kong’s company migration system\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides support to the Government regarding the introduction of company migration arrangements in Hong Kong, including assisting with legislative changes to the banking sector’s legislation and related legislation, as well as the legislative procedures related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Supervisory Overview\n\nWithin the year, the Monetary Authority conducted 174 off-site due diligence reviews, covering a wide scope, including assessment of authorized institutions’ CAMEL, corporate governance, and risk management. To continue to promote the risk governance level of authorized institutions, the Monetary Authority, together with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors or committees under the boards, co-chaired 36 meetings. Furthermore, the Monetary Authority, in co-operation with authorized institutions and their external auditors, held 38 three-party co-chaired meetings. In addition, the Monetary Authority conducted on-site examination of various business tasks of authorized institutions, including governance and practices in credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the increasing prevalence of technology applications by authorized institutions, risk management of business operations and technology risks is another key regulatory focus. The HKMA has also further strengthened its supervision of climate risk management by authorized institutions to enhance their resilience to climate changing. The HKMA’s work in maintaining financial stability and promote robust growth in the global economic environment has been commended, and it was selected by The AsianBanker as “Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific”.\n\nAssistant Chief Executive (Banking Supervision) Ms. Chloe Chu, on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the “Asia Pacific Region Best Macroeconomic Supervision Institution” award presented by The Asian Banker.\n\nIn supervisory regulation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts on-site examination of securities, investment products, trusts, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related business of authorized institutions, as well as consumer protection matters, and uses thematic assessment as a means to ensure, to review new projects or areas assessed as high risk.\n\nTable 1 are included gold supervisory regulation work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2024.\n\nTable 1 supervisory work overview\n\na. The additional supervisory work focusing on the resilience of operations includes a Financial Supervisory Commission investigation and authorization for corporate institutions to conduct self-assessment to assess progress and identify areas needing strengthening, as well as extensive outreach activities with the industry on the framework and practices at bilateral and industry levels.\nb. Furthermore, supervisory efforts concentrate on assessing authorized institutions’ strategy and methods for approval and continued risk management of specific loan portfolios, such as loans for commercial property and small and medium-sized enterprises.\nc. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the Financial Supervisory Commission’s “Climate Risk Management” module GS-1 in the regulatory regulation handbook.\n\n# credit risks\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe loan total decreased by 2.8% in 2024, and the decrease in 2023 was 3.6%. Table 2 set out the growth situation of various loans and advances. The total related loans to Mainland decreased by 8.7% to 38,590 billion Hong Kong dollars (Table 3).\n\nGiven that policy rates remain high, some Mainland real estate development companies’ debt issues have not fully moderated, and the local commercial real estate market is soft, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices. Throughout the year, the asset quality of the banking sector continued to face pressure, but the risk situation remained manageable. The sector-specific classified loan ratio for the banking sector at the end of 2024 was 1.96%, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023, while during the same period, the sector-specific classified loan ratio for related loans in Mainland decreased from 2.58% to 2.38%.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA conducted an assessment, evaluating the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with a key focus including exposure to industries more easily affected, loans with and without collateral to private banking and wealth management customers, monitoring of credit risk related to Hong Kong offshore business, and exposure to risks of non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2 loans and advances growth\n\nTable 3 Mainland related growth\n\n# Alleviating the funding pressure on bank customers.\n\n# Support local SMEs\n\nSMEs are a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s economic system, and the HKMA has continuously monitored their ability to obtain bank financing. Since the HKMA and the banking sector established the “Banking Sector SMEs Loan Coordination Mechanism” (SMEs coordination mechanism) in 2019, multiple rounds of SMEs support measures have been launched, including the “pre-approved principal repayment deferral” Scheme, to assist SMEs through the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector launched additional measures to support SMEs whose operating conditions still face challenges due to economic transformation, and to assist SMEs in continued development and transformation.\n\n# New support measures for SMEs.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched nine initiatives in March through the SMEs coordination mechanism to support SMEs in obtaining bank financing and support their continued development.\n\nThe nine support initiatives for SMEs announced in March.\n\nNo early repayment is required for mortgage customers who do not provide payments on time.\nAdjustments to the credit amount provide customers with a minimum of six months’ transition period.\n"}

概覽\n\n在2024年，金管局繼續致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n金管局擴展及優化香港與內地間的互聯互通機制，有助鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場間的橋樑角色。年內，多項有關「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）的優化措施出台，便利粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）個人投資者進行跨境投資。於2月，金管局將中華人民共和國財政部（國家財政部）發行的在岸國債和內地政策性銀行發行的政策性金融債納入人民幣流動資金安排的合資格抵押品名單。於7月，兩地相關部門公布進一步支持境外投資者使用通過「債券通」持有的在岸債券作為「北向互換通」交易的履約抵押品，並於2025年1月實施。此外，「北向互換通」於年內進行優化，增加投資者在對沖策略和管理投資組合方面的靈活性及效率。\n\n在2024年，香港的離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。金管局推出一級流動性提供行安排的優化措施，包括增加提供行數目及擴大安排規模。於年底前，香港人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力提升，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要。\n\n金管局推出大灣區金融合作下的多項利民便商措施，包括促進企業跨境融資的跨境徵信互通業務試點，以及便利香港居民在大灣區置業的跨境匯款支付安排。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港整體金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增強香港作為首選基金管理中心及家族辦公室業務樞紐的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，金管局透過Evergreen項目發行第二批代幣化債券，並推出「EvergreenHub」一站式數碼債券知識庫和「數碼債券資助計劃」，繼續推動香港債券市場創新。於10月，金管局公布「可持續金融行動計劃」，訂明進一步鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的具體目標。\n\n另一方面，金管局繼續加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。金管局在11月舉辦第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期三日，主題為「在變局中前航」，雲集全球各地金融業界翹楚分享各自獨到的觀點。峰會先由國務院副總理何立峰先生作開幕主題演講，接着是三間內地金融監管機構的分享環節，以及由國際金融領袖參與的專題討論。峰會共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的領袖參與，充分體現國際金融界對香港的支持和信心。\n\n年內金管局亦舉辦各項其他研討會及會議，包括：\n\n- 於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    -

status\n\nThe HKMA has made important progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a global competitive Financial Centre.\n\nThe HKMA is collaborating with Mainland and Hong Kong authorities to launch a range of measures, together deepening and expanding the linkage and connectivity of Hong Kong’s and Mainland’s financial markets, including enhancements to the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect”; expanding the eligible collateral scope of the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Bond Connect; optimising Northbound Bond Connect; and optimising the Primary liquidity providing arrangement. These measures help reinforce Hong Kong’s gateway role and underpin its status as a hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in bolstering Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened market outreach efforts targeted at stakeholders and the Mainland, allowing everyone to fully understand the soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third Investment Summit and various other successful events have not only helped enhance Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also created a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and supervisory organisations, continuing to contribute to the global work of maintaining financial stability and promote development of the financial markets.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in all areas of the \"Fintech 25\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe Faster Payment System “FPS” registration numbers and turnover continue to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations at the end of 2024. The whole year average daily processing of Hong Kong dollar real-time transactions increased to 1.65 million items. HKMA is working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the implementation of linkage between Hong Kong’s “FPS” and Mainland online payment bank-to-bank clearing system, realizing cross-border payment.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA continues strives to enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has expanded and optimised the mutual connectivity mechanism between Hong Kong and the Mainland, which supports Hong Kong’s role as a bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. Several enhancements related to the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect” (“WMC”) were implemented this year, facilitating cross-border investment by individual investors in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). In February, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority added onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China (National Treasury) and policy financial bonds issued by Mainland policy banks to the list of eligible collateral for the RMB Liquidity Facility. In July, relevant departments in the two jurisdictions announced further support for offshore investors to use onshore bonds held through the “Bond Connect” as collateral for “Northbound Bond Connect” transactions, to be implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, the “Northbound Bond Connect” underwent optimisation this year, increasing the agility and efficiency of investors in hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business grew robustly. The HKMA launched enhancements to the Primary liquidity providing arrangement, including increase in the number of providing banks and expanding the arrangement scale. By the end of the year, the night-time cross-border Real-Time Gross Settlement services capability of Hong Kong’s Renminbi Payment system will enhance to better payable global demand for cross-border renminbi payments.\n\nThe HKMA launched a number of facilitative measures under financial co-operation in the Greater Bay Area, including a pilot scheme to promote cross-border financing through cross-boundary credit information sharing business, and arrangements to facilitate payments for Hong Kong residents’ cross-boundary property purchases.\n\nThe HKMA continues strives to enhance Hong Kong’s overall financial platform’s competitiveness. Specifically, to promote Hong Kong as a preferred Management Centre and a hub for family business, the HKMA collaborates closely with the Government and the financial sector to create a more facilitated tax and supervisory environment. Furthermore, through the Evergreen project, the HKMA issued the second batch of tokenized bonds and launched the “EvergreenHub” one-stop digital bond knowledge repository and the “Digital Bond Grant Scheme”, continuing to promote innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market. In October, the HKMA announced the “Sustainable Finance Action Plan”, provides specific objectives to further consolidate Hong Kong as a regional green and sustainable finance hub.\n\nOn the other hand, Hong Kong’s supervisory work continues to expand market拓展工作, to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders. The HKMA held the third Investment Summit in November. The summit lasts three days, with the theme \"Navigating Change,\" bringing together industry leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives. The summit began with an opening keynote speech by Deputy Premier He Lifeng, followed by a sharing session from three Mainland financial regulatory institutions, and a special discussion participated in by international financial leaders. The summit共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的participants, fully demonstrated the financial community’s support and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Commission also hold various other workshops and meetings, including:\n\n- Co-host a joint climate finance meeting with the Dubai Financial Services Authority in September;\n- Co-organise the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Asia professional risk management personnel association in October;\n- Also in October, co-host an international financial seminar with the Bank for International Clearing; and\n- Hold a meeting of the Financial Stability Board in December, which will be the first event of its kind in Asia since 2016, bringing together leaders and senior officials from more than 50 countries’ financial institutions and 12 international standards organisations.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA also actively strengthened bilateral linkages with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE Central Bank) and the Central Bank of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Central Bank), promoteing linkages between the Middle East and Asia regions' investment and financial markets. The HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UAE Central Bank to establish cross-border debt capital market infrastructure linkage and promote cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to strengthen cooperation in the areas of financial services.\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次Hong Kong與瑞士金融合作dialogue，討論content涵蓋within the region及local的prospects與challenges，以及sustainable金融、fintech與market linkage領域的latest development及潛在co-operation room。\n\nThe HKMA interviewed Thailand and Malaysia in January and May, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and corporate entities, promoting Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, and further strengthening bilateral financial linkages and co-operation. A key focus is promoting the use of Renminbi and local currency as cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as Hong Kong’s competitive advantages.\n\nIn the international domain, the Monetary Authority actively participates in affairs within the central banking sector and continues to play a leadership role in various regional and international committees. The Monetary Authority currently serves as co-chairs of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) Policy and Standards Groups and the Asia region consultation group under the Financial Stability Board. It also serves as co-chair of the Financial Innovation Network co-chairs under the Financial Stability Board (until July 2024). The Monetary Authority is also Chairman of the key emerging market economies central bank meeting under the Bank for International Settlements and the crypto-asset framework peer review group under the Financial Stability Board. Between 2018 and 2024, the Monetary Authority has continuously served as Chairman of the Financial Market Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Regional Financial Stability Assessment Process (EMEAP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office and various bank departments continue implementing the “Fintech 2025” strategy, promote the widespread adoption of fintech within the industry, and enhance Hong Kong’s status as an Asian fintech hub. Key measures implementing within the year include:\n\nFurther promote the application of financial technology in banks across five key areas, including wealth technology, insurance technology, green technology, Artificial Intelligence, and distributed ledger technology;\nPromote work on central bank digital currency to understand its benefits and potential application scenarios, including:\n    - Push forward the “multiple central bank digital currency cross-border network” (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments;\n    - Further study the resolvability of issuing “digital Hong Kong dollar” (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; and\n    - Begin to explore the development of a tokenized market in Hong Kong supported by central bank digital currency;\n- Facilitate borrowing for SMEs through “Commercial Data Interchange”;\n- Strengthen cross-border financial technology co-operation; and\n- Promote more widespread use of the Faster Payment System “FPS”.\n\nThe use of Faster Payment System continues to increase in 2024, with the number of registrations and turnover steadily rising over the past six years. As at the end of 2024, the number of Faster Payment System registrations increased to 10,000,000, with the whole year’s daily average number of transactions increasing by 33% compared to the previous year. Besides person-to-person payments and commercial payments steadily growing, top-up of government bills, payments to merchants and value for Stored Value Facility electronic wallets or bank accounts through Faster Payment System continue to increase, is providing the impetus for Faster Payment System turnover to continue to grow.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of local retail payment business, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority monitors six specified retail payment systems and supervises 15 licensed Stored Value Facility (SVF), four of which are issued by licensed banks. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued closely co-operation with the industry, following the rise in fraud risks, to strengthen control measures and protect consumers.\n\nThe Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s legislative proposal for a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong, following the completion of a two-month public consultation in February, jointly published a consultation summary in July and will submit the draft Stablecoin Ordinance to the Legislative Council for deliberation in December. To further understand the business model of stablecoin issuers and formulate an appropriate regulatory regime, the HKMA also launched a Sandbox for stablecoin issuers and announced three participating institutions entering the Sandbox in July. At the same time, the HKMA continues to actively participate in the work of international organisations on topics related to digital assets (including stablecoins and tokenisation), ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework meets international standards and best practices.\n\n# The HKMA in 2024 outlined measures to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a financial centre.\n\nDeepen Hong Kong’s linkage with Mainland markets, consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a hub for offshore renminbi business, and strengthen links within the Greater Bay Area.\n\n- Enhance Wealth Management Connect and Northbound Bond Connect.\n- Expand the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facility and the scope of eligible collateral for Northbound Bond Connect to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and Mainland policy banks.\n- Enhance the primary liquidity providing arrangement.\n- Enhance Hong Kong’s Real-Time Gross Settlement system’s nighttime cross-border service capabilities to better support the demand for cross-border RMB payments worldwide.\n- Provide support for Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government issuing Dim Sum bonds in Hong Kong.\n- Facilitate cross-border financing for corporate entities through cross-boundary credit information sharing cooperation.\n- Implement measures to facilitate cross-border remittances for Greater Bay Area property purchases.\n- Deepen engagement and communication between Mainland institutions and Hong Kong’s financial sector to capture business opportunities.\n\n# Strengthen links with worldwide contacts.\n\nHold a series of international events: the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the Financial Stability Board meeting, and a workshop co-organised with the Bank for International Settlements.\nStrengthen market expansion work, promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders, and lay a solid foundation for co-operation with countries in the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.\nActively participate in international and regional central banks and supervisory organisations.\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness.\n\nThrough the Evergreen project, promote innovation in the bond market, including support for the Government to launched the world’s first multi-Currency digital bond kick-off a one-stop digital bond knowledge repository “EvergreenHub”, and launched a “Digital Bond Grant Scheme”.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1

markets performed broadly well. Major economies recorded stable growth, and inflation also retreated to a level more close to policy objectives. Several central banks successively lowered policy rates, which is beneficial to the investment environment. For the whole year of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly impact the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar, and may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system(s), thereby maintaining Hong Kong’s status as a financial centre. The HKMA, responsible to the Financial Secretary under the delegations of powers and delegated powers provisions, manages the Exchange Fund’s investment and management and is responsible to the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund management\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is to formulate the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund.\n\n(i) Protect capital;\n(ii) Ensure the overall monetary foundation is fully supported by US dollar assets with high liquidity;\n(iii) Ensure liquidity capital is sufficient for maintaining currency and financial stability; and\n(iv) Under the premise of meeting items (i) to (iii) above, strive for investment return as much as possible to protect the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe above objectives fully consider the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the Exchange Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Mapping 1).\n\nChart 1 illustrates the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio categories.\n\nThe Exchange Fund broadly consists of two main portfolios: support portfolios and investment portfolios. Support portfolios held highly liquid US dollar asset(s), providing fully support for the monetary basis as required by the currency issuing system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in bond markets and stock markets of economies of economic cooperation and development organisations members, to protect the value of asset(s) and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risk and enhance long-term return, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in a prudent and incremental manner, has allocated a portion of the Exchange Fund's asset mix to a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging markets and the Mainland bond and stock markets, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and stocks are held by the investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation of the long-term growth Portfolio, together with the allocation of other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a diversified asset mix strategy.\n\nA strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007, and has consistently held shares of Hong Kong Exchange Clearing Limited, purchased for Exchange Fund accounts with a strategic objective. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance does not include it.\n\n# At the Exchange Fund deposit\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accept deposits from fiscal Reserves, Government fund(s) and statutory organisations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment Portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major individual example, and its deposit policy rates are linked to the return of the investment Portfolio and long-term growth asset mix. The rate of interest depends on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the investment Portfolio and long-term growth Portfolio in the Future Fund was about 35:65.\n\n# Investment procedures\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment procedures are based on strategic asset allocation and strategic asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation reflects an investment basis, that is, the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objective. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as guidance, and through strategic asset allocation, seeks to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocation will often deviate from the benchmark allocation (that is, strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocation is known as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consultation with the Advisory Committees, determines the investment benchmark and sets the tracking error quota, and the Monetary Authority is authorized to decide on strategic asset allocation and set the allowable scope of strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the allowable scope of strategic deviation, and profit from changing short-dated markets.\n\n# investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for the investment and related risk management Functions of the Exchange Fund. Office staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support Portfolio and part of the investment portfolios. This internally managed Portfolio includes global fixed-income market investments, and through various derivative tools executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy.\n\n# External investment manager\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，to effect sustainable return, and let the Exchange Fund benefit from diversification and complementary investment means, as well as to acquire external investment managers’ market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nEmploying external investment managers’ related expenses include fund management, depository fees, transaction fees, withholding tax and other taxes. These expenses are mainly impacted by market factors and vary year by year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is increasingly complex, and robust risk management is more important. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established rigorous controls and investment guidelines for all investment portfolios managed by internal and external managers, and established rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has three lines of defense to implement effective risk management and governance. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly monitors major risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity, and business operations risks) and sets up risk management procedures, providing a resilient framework for strategic planning and diversified work.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that moderately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investment can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks involving investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has integrated ESG factors into the Exchange Fund’s investment management process, with its guiding principles being: when ESG investment has a risk-adjusted long-term return comparable to other investment projects, ESG investment will generally be prioritised. See chapter \"Responsible Investment\" in the \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\" for further information related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work in responsible investment.\n\n# Exchange Fund performance\n\n# 2024 financial market\n\nIn 2024, global financial markets generally performed well.\n\nMajor stock markets saw significant growth in 2024, with the US market in particular exhibiting exceptional growth in the first three quarters amid generally positive economic and inflation trends and the Artificial Intelligence trend. However, market conditions in the fourth quarter became volatile and retreated from high levels as concerns over increasing inflation and rising bond yields emerged, and investors also grew more prudent. Mainland and Hong Kong markets benefited from a range of economic and stock market policy measures implemented by the Central in the third quarter, leading to improved investor confidence. However, given the situation where growth in the real economy remains uncertain, both regions’ stock markets softened in the fourth quarter.\n\nGlobal bond markets have also experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although central banks generally established the general policy direction of interest rate cuts, the pace and magnitude of the cuts changed multiple times during the year. By the 4th quarter, markets began to watch the US fiscal policy for 2025, and US bond yields surged by 23.5% within the quarter, putting downward pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn terms of monetary markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, as interest rate trends and the US economy’s performance were relatively strong.\n\nTable 1 set out the performance of major currency, bond markets, and stock markets in 2024.\n\n# Exchange Fund performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$2,188 billion in 2024, including:\n\nGains from bond investments totaled HK$135.9 billion;\nGains from stock investments totaled HK$90.9 billion (of which HK$21.8 billion came from stock investments in Hong Kong, and HK$69.1 billion came from investments in other stocks);\na decrease in the value of foreign assets in exchange rates of HK$35.6 billion; and\ngains from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund investment holding company totaled HK$27.6 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategic Portfolio records gains of 28 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the Exchange Fund’s total asset value reached 40,810 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total value of the long-term growth Portfolio investments was 5,412 billion Hong Kong dollars, of which private control was 4,348 billion Hong Kong dollars and real estate was 1,064 billion Hong Kong dollars. The outstanding amount already exposure but not yet drawdown for investment within the long-term growth Portfolio was 2,886 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset portfolios) had a rate of return on investment of 5.2% in 2024, with the portfolio’s rate of return at 7.2% and support portfolio at 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 is 11.2%.\n\nChart 1 shows the rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 shows the investment rate of return of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment rate of return for different periods. The average rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 2022 to 2024 was 2.0%, from 2020 to 2024 was 31 (date)%, from 2015 to 2024 was 31 (date)%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.5%. Table 3 set out the currency proportions of the Exchange Fund assets as of December 31, 2024. See pages 203 to 309 of the Exchange Fund’s audited financial report for the annual year 2024 for further details.\n\nChart 1: Exchange Fund investment rate of return (1994 to 2024).\n"}

意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2024年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及37.1。\n\n於2024年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共 39,151.17 億港元，金融負債共 13,862.99 億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除特別註明外，所有金額均以港幣百萬元位列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

Exchange Fund financial Table\n\n# Audit Office Report\n\n# Hong Kong’s Special Administrative Region Government audit and assessment office.\n\n# Independent auditor’s report to the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advice\n\nThis certifies that I have audited the financial statements set out on pages 209 to 309 of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the Group), which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the group as at December 31, 2024, and the income and expenditure account, comprehensive gains table, equity movements table, and cash flow table for the year then ended, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including major accounting policy data.\n\nI believe that the financial reports have already fairly and accurately reflected the financial condition of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, and the financial performance and cash flows for the year to that date, in accordance with the Hong Kong Association’s Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66) by the Chief Executive.\n\n# The basis of advice.\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit Standards of the Audit Commission. The responsibility that I shall bear according to those Standards is detailed in the section of this report, \"Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Report.\" According to those Standards, I am independent of the group, and have already fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those Standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriately provides the basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit issues\n\nKey audit issues are, based on my professional judgment, the most critical matters regarding the audit of the annual financial statements as at December 31, 2024. I have addressed these issues when auditing the overall financial statements and forming an opinion, and I will not provide separate advice on these issues.\n\n# Financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value.\n\nSee financial table 2, 2.6, and 3.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, the Group's financial assets valued at fair value totaled 39,151.17 billion Hong Kong dollars, and financial liabilities totaled 13,862.99 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\n86% of the financial assets and liabilities’ fair value is the same as the quoted price of those assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using a valuation method, with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 14% of these financial assets’ fair value is estimated, and the inputs used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets total HK$5,522.51 billion, primarily including non-listed investment fund(s).\n\nGiven the large amount and involving estimation, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a critical audit matter.\n\nRegarding the valuation of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures of different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related controls.\n\nAssessment and testing of controls, including measures for monitoring related applications within the system.\n\nRegarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities, obtain confirmation.\n\nIf using Market prices, verify the prices according to independent sources.\n\nIf the inputs of the valuation method are based on observable market data, the assessment of whether the valuation method is suitable and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the inputs based on independent sources; and\n\nIf the inputs of the valuation method are not based on observable market data, is the assessment of the valuation method suitable, and are the related assumptions and inputs reasonable?\n\n# Valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value.\n\nSee financial table note 2.11, 17 and 18.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are stated at fair value, with a total value of HK$211.32 billion on December 31, 2024. The Group also has interests in associated companies and joint ventures, the main business of which is to have overseas investment properties. Whether held directly by the Group or by associated companies or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined by independent professional estimation, harmonise. These estimations involve significant judgment and estimation, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value includes audit procedures.\n\nTo effect reporting and review of the valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by linked companies or joint ventures, and to verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the related valuation reports.\n\nAssess the independent value and qualifications of valuers; and\n\nAssessment of valuation methods, related assumptions, and inputs is necessary to determine their suitability.\n\n# Other data\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other data. Other data includes all data within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2024 annual report, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy advice on the financial table does not cover other data, and I will not publish any form of verification conclusions regarding other data.\n\nRegarding financial audit, I have a responsibility to read other data, to consider whether that data is materially inconsistent with the financial report or the situation I ascertained during the audit, or appears to have material misstatements. Based on the work I have executed, if I believe that other data have material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no reporting.\n\n# The Monetary Authority and Advisory Committees under the Exchange Fund Fund’s audits committee shall bear responsibility for the financial table.\n\nThe Monetary Authority shall be responsible for preparing true and fair financial reports in accordance with the Hong Kong Association’s Standards issued by the Hong Kong certified public accountant(s) Association and instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it considers necessary, to enable the financial reports to not exist having material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority shall be responsible for assessing the group's viable operating capacity, and disclose issues related to continued operating conditions as applicable, and use continued operating as the accounting basis.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s audits committee is responsible for supervision of the Group’s financial reporting.\n\n# Auditors shall bear responsibilities for the financial audit.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the overall financial reporting does not exist any material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and provides an audit report including my advice. Reasonable assurance is a high standard of assurance, but cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing Standards can detect all existing material misstatements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and will be considered material if they are reasonably likely to influence economic decisions made by users of the financial reports.\n\nIn the process of conducting an audit according to the audit Standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess risks of material misstatements in financial statements due to fraud or error; design and execution of audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, as the foundation for my advice. Due to the possibility of fraud involving collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false representations, or overriding internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements caused by fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those caused by error.\n\nTo understand and audit internal controls, in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not aims to publish opinion on the Group’s internal control effectiveness;\n\nAssessment of whether the Monetary Authority adopts appropriate accounting policies, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n\nTo determine whether the Monetary Authority’s practices, using viability as the accounting foundation, are appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, to determine whether there exists a significant uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast substantial doubt on the group’s resilience. If I believe that a significant uncertainty exists, it is necessary to advise users to closely monitor the related data disclosure in the audit report. If the disclosed related data is insufficient, I shall issue an audit report that is not unqualified. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained as at the audit report date. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to be unable to continue operating.\n\nAssessment of the overall presentation, structure, and content of financial statements, including disclosure data, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect transactions and issues; and\n\nPlan and execute group audit, in order to effect sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for financial data of the Group's entities or business units, as the foundation for advice on the financial statements. I am responsible for guidance, supervision, and review of the audit work carried out for the group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the audit committee under the Advisory Committees of the Exchange Fund regarding the scope and time of the audit plan, as well as significant audit findings etc., including any material internal control deficiencies identified during the year.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Advisory Committee under the audits Committee of the Exchange Fund, explain that I have already met the related ethical requirements of independent, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that would reasonably affect my independence, and, where applicable, related measures to prevent.\n\nFrom issues communicated with the Advisory Committee under the Advisory Committees of the Exchange Fund, I will decide which issues are most critical for the audits of the current financial report, thus constituting key audit issues. I will disclose these issues in the auditor's report, unless legal legislation does not allow provide disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare cases, because there is a reasonable expectation that communicating a matter in my report will create negative consequences exceeding the public interest, and I decide are to not disclose that matter in the report.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Financial Table Note\n\n(Except as specially noted, all amounts are listed in Hong Kong-based currency in units of ten thousand.)\n\n# 1 business\n\nThe Monetary Authority, in its capacity as the manager of the Exchange Fund, grants powers according to the Financial Secretary, and manages the fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).
