{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","en":"# Chairman's Report\n\n2018 was the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, international political and economic situations have undergone significant changes, including many scenes that even the best screenwriters could not have imagined. In my annual report last year, I pointed out that the 2017 financial market performance was \"unexpectedly positive,\" while also mentioning \"hidden concerns\" about the outlook. Looking back at 2018, it might be described as \"first good then bad.\" Global stock indices hit historical highs in January, but the fervent investment sentiment quickly encountered the cold front of U.S.-China trade tensions, along with ongoing Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical tensions, and the Federal Reserve's four interest rate hikes. The optimistic market sentiment abruptly reversed, leading to significant asset price declines throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with a cumulative decline of about 10% for the year, marking the worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its peak, declining 13.6% for the year, recording the largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# Steady Union Exchange, Confidence Relies On\n\nDespite the unpredictable external environment, the Hong Kong financial system has remained resilient, with the money market operating smoothly and unimpeded. The Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented for 35 years, has successfully withstood the test of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HK$1 trillion in capital inflows into the Hong Kong dollar has accumulated. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to an increase in carry trades of selling Hong Kong dollars and buying U.S. dollars. The Hong Kong dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar in early 2023, and the \"Weak Side Exchange Guarantee,\" established in 2005, was triggered for the first time in April and again 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) orderly and transparently absorbed HKD 103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders under the \"buy Hong Kong dollars, sell U.S. dollars\" mechanism of the Weak Side Exchange Guarantee. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points during 2018, and banks raised their prime rates following the U.S. rate hike in September of last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operation mechanism of the Weak Side Exchange Guarantee through various channels to the public, helping people understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable part of the normalization of Hong Kong's interest rates and the normal operation of the exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Hong Kong Linked Exchange Rate System at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government also emphasized that the exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary stability. This has helped to maintain the confidence of Hong Kong residents in the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Banking System Stable with Progress\n\nThe 2008 Global Financial Crisis exposed various hidden flaws and vulnerabilities in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in banking regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) banking supervision focuses on two aspects: one is prudent regulation of banks' asset-liability risks, and the other is banks' conduct standards, neither of which should be neglected. As a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA has the responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards, ensuring that the banking sector in Hong Kong operates prudently and soundly. By the end of last year, the capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong banks reached 20.3%, which is significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8% and also a marked increase from the 14.7% level during the Global Financial Crisis. Large banks had an average liquidity coverage ratio of 167.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistake of using public funds to rescue \"too big to fail\" financial institutions during the Global Financial Crisis, the Financial Stability Board has established international standards for financial institution resolution mechanisms. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented mechanisms meeting the requirements. The Resolution Mechanism Office under the HKMA is implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the \"Capital Adequacy Rules\" were also introduced, and more related rules will be introduced in the future.\n\nGiven the continuous rise in housing prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority took proactive measures, introducing eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the Hong Kong banking system would have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks if the property market were to reverse. These measures proved highly effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. Bank credit recorded a mild growth of 4.4% during the year, overall asset quality remained good, and the non-performing loan ratio for retail banking further dropped to 0.5%, well below international and local historical averages. Banking sector profits continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity (ROE) rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups achieved strong performance in their operations in Hong Kong, becoming a key pillar of their group's profitability.\n\n# Stable and Virtuous Culture: Above Sets the Example, Below Follows\n\nIn 2010, the HKMA established the Banking Conduct Department to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes, in addition to setting various regulatory requirements targeting fundamental banking conduct, we have recently vigorously promoted reforms in banking culture, encouraging banks to foster a sound culture through governance, reward systems, and evaluation and feedback mechanisms. This aims to ensure that banks achieve top-down alignment internally, fundamentally restoring and enhancing customers' trust and respect in banks. Following the HKMA's provision of specific guidelines to all banks in Hong Kong in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on banking culture by the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and implementation, ensuring the effective execution of the three pillars of a sound banking culture.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to promote financial inclusion last year, catering to communities unable to utilize new technologies. For example, we, together with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, encouraged convenience stores to offer the Elderly EasyPay cash withdrawal service without the need to shop; the network of such convenience stores has expanded to over 300 locations. We also contacted Hong Kong Post to introduce the Elderly Easy Withdrawal Service at seven post offices mainly located in outlying islands and the New Territories. In response to the HKMA's recommendations, the banking industry actively increased accessible facilities and provided inclusive banking services throughout the year. One example is the number of ATMs with voice navigation, which increased more than tenfold to over 700 units within a year. Additionally, with the HKMA's proactive promotion, we expect that more banks will gradually establish additional physical branches and introduce mobile banking services in remote areas, providing convenience for citizens.\n\n# Smart Bank: Fresh Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with banks and the technology sector to launch the \"Smart Banking New Era\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of fintech in Hong Kong and offering citizens a new experience in payment and banking services. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) in September. As the world's first retail fast payment system, it broke down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, enabling citizens to enjoy 24\/7 instant transfers of Hong Kong dollars and Chinese yuan. The HKMA also simultaneously introduced the world's first \"shared QR code\" standard and application, allowing merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems using a single QR code. Since its launch, the FPS has been widely welcomed by the public. Within half a year, the number of registrations exceeded 2.58 million, with an average of 60,000 transactions per day, and the average transaction value reached HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 respectively.\n\nIn May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the recognition of virtual banks, followed by 33 institutions submitting applications for virtual bank licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have already been issued, and it is expected that they will officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will help promote the development and innovation of Hong Kong's financial technology, provide individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises with new services and experiences, and promote financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA released an OpenAPI framework in July. Banks will open product and service interfaces in four stages, pioneering a more flexible and open fintech environment that allows bank customers to more conveniently integrate account data, access information, and select services that align with their needs. This year, a total of 42 new technology products have used the HKMA's fintech regulatory sandbox for testing, with 28 completing trials and the related products and services successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe \"TradeLink\" trade financing platform, developed in collaboration with multiple banks by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, was officially launched in October last year. This platform, which utilizes distributed ledger technology, aims to enhance the efficiency of banks' approval processes for trade financing. TradeLink is currently testing connections with relevant platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFintech is not only widely applied in daily life but has also entered the compliance and regulatory fields in recent years. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages banks to use Regtech (Regulatory Technology) to assist in handling daily operations such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the HKMA is studying the use of Suptech (Supervisory Technology) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Consolidate and Enhance Financial Strength\n\nThe competition among international financial centers revolves around soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in economic, social, and technological development, seize opportunities, and continuously expand new development spaces for Hong Kong's financial industry. Green finance represents a major opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project financing markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and collaborates with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government in promoting green finance. Apart from supporting the government's preparation for the issuance plan of HKD 10 billion in government green bonds, we also held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two large-scale international conferences, to enhance market understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the government's green bond subsidy program launched last year and Hong Kong's green finance certification services. The scale of green bond issuance in Hong Kong last year exceeded USD 11 billion, which is more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown increasing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016. Its partners have more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority co-hosted a high-level roundtable meeting with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) for the first time.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","en":"# Introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the central banking institution of Hong Kong, with four main functions: maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the linked exchange rate system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; as well as managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Statutory Authority of the Financial Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly known as the Legislative Council) passed the amended provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly Financial Secretary) to appoint the Financial Management Commissioner. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was then established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management and Supervision Agency (FMA) Commissioner are explicitly stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, Banking Ordinance, Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the FMA Commissioner dated June 25, 2003, outlines the allocation of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters and also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the FMA Commissioner. The relevant letter is a public document and can be accessed on the FMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, with control vested in the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner, appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, assists the Financial Secretary in executing the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as other ordinances and duties assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Management Commissioner is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Financial Management Commissioner is the Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau exercises regulatory and supervisory functions over banking business and deposit-taking business under the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is responsible for handling the eligibility matters of licensed banks, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Financial Services Secretary as the resolution authority for banking entities. The Ordinance grants the Financial Services Secretary a range of powers to orderly resolve the relevant entities, thereby reducing the risks to the stability and effective operation of Hong Kong's financial system arising from the unsustainable operations of the relevant entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Financial Services Authority certain powers related to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund schemes.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance provides for the delegation of powers of inspection and investigation with respect to a bank's insurance business to the Financial Services and Markets Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Financial Services Authority to supervise banks in complying with the ordinance's provisions.\n\nThe Depositor Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Financial Services and Markets Authority the responsibility to provide assistance in the operation of the depositor protection scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation from the depositor protection scheme fund to depositors of insolvent banks.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facility Instruments Ordinance, the Financial Secretary may designate and supervise settlement and clearing systems that are important for the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system, as well as for Hong Kong's role as an international financial center. The Ordinance also empowers the Financial Secretary to manage the licensing system for stored value payment instruments, designate retail payment systems, and supervise whether the operation of such systems is safe and efficient.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government's structure, but can hire employees under terms different from those for civil servants to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. The chairman and employees of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are public officials. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's daily operations are highly autonomous within the scope of legal powers granted or delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and the monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Financial Management Commissioner, the Financial Secretary stipulated that currency stability should be maintained through the Monetary Authority system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Director of the Financial Secretary's Department, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Management Department include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Developing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and in appropriate circumstances, operating the relevant systems to promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in the Hong Kong currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nIn terms of the methods used in daily operations and the implementation of government policy objectives, the HKMA has always maintained high autonomy, while also ensuring high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center and promoting the development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority must effectively fulfill its responsibilities by gaining the public's confidence. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a diligent approach to fulfill its responsibility of explaining its policies and work to the public, and strives to address issues that are of public concern and fall within its scope of responsibilities.\n\nThe Commissioner of Financial Services is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. In addition, the HKMA is aware of its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. While carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive connections with society, the HKMA adheres to policies aimed at enhancing transparency and maintaining an open approach. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, taking into account legal restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data;\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to societal trends and appropriately responds to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it publishes a variety of bilingual (Chinese and English) journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to enhance communication with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's headquarters houses an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, including lectures and guided tours of the information center, to explain the HKMA's functions to the public, particularly students, and to enhance citizens' financial knowledge. For detailed information on the HKMA's media engagement, publications, and public education activities, please refer to the \"Institutional Functions\" chapter.\n\nThe frequency with which the HKMA has published account data from the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuance Department has been gradually increasing, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA began participating in the IMF's Central Bank \"Data Disclosure Special Standards\" program in 1999. The HKMA also publishes meeting records of the Monetary Policy Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Council, as well as the Currency Issuance Department's operational reports. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also included banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has committed to briefing the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council on the Authority's各项工作 and policies three times a year and answering relevant inquiries. In addition, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will occasionally attend meetings of the Financial Affairs Committee and the Bills Committee of the Legislative Council to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft bills.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Other Committees\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund, he will consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under Section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Financial Management Officer) are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their personal capacity with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed due to their respective professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The professional expertise and experience of the members cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established five specialized committees to oversee specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work and to report and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been previously discussed by the relevant specialized committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and makes recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters such as the Monetary Authority's remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budgets, and administrative and governance matters. In 2018, the committee held five meetings, covering topics including the Monetary Authority's expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual salary review, and strategic planning. The committee also reviews the Monetary Authority's regular work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's financial reporting process, evaluates the sufficiency and effectiveness of its internal control systems, and submits reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's financial statements, preparing the components and accounting principles of the financial statements, and in conjunction with external and internal auditors, reviewing the audit scope and results. Members of the Audit Committee do not hold any administrative functions within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The Committee held two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee monitors the operation of the Monetary Issuance Bureau mechanism and reports on its role as a cornerstone of Hong Kong's Linked Exchange Rate System. The Committee is responsible for ensuring the mechanism operates in accordance with established policies, proposing improvements to the mechanism, and ensuring the operation maintains high transparency. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly publishes the Monetary Policy Committee's meeting minutes and reports on the operation of the Monetary Issuance Bureau mechanism submitted to the Committee. The Committee held four meetings in 2018.\n"}

With the global economic growth slowing down, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will also slow down in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong economy continued to expand in 2018, but the annual growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the annual growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in domestic demand growth and continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Locally, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but then lost momentum, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth-eroding effects of local asset price adjustments. Overall investment spending also slowed due to weak business confidence. Externally, goods exports remained broadly stable in the first three quarters but significantly declined in the fourth quarter as US-China trade tensions intensified. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, services exports recorded faster annual growth, partly due to the strong performance of the Hong Kong tourism sector, while services imports were largely maintained due to growth in transport, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarterly changes in total fixed capital formation, adjusted for seasonal factors, are not available. Data source: Government Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local GDP. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency Condition\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar weakened throughout 2018, mainly due to carry trade activities driven by the negative interest rate differential between the HKD and USD. Particularly, the weak side guarantee was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to purchase HKD and sell USD at a fixed rate of 7.85 HKD to 1 USD under the linked exchange rate system (HKMA's system). According to the design of the linked exchange rate system, the monetary base consequently contracted, indicating a reduction in interbank liquidity. Combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, this led to an overall rise in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR). As the cost of funds in the banking system increased, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September following the Federal Reserve's adjustment of the federal funds rate target range. Regarding credit growth, the slowdown in local economic expansion and weaker external trade performance caused the annual growth rate of total bank loans to significantly decline from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflation pressure slightly increased in 2018. After excluding the impact of the government's one-time relief measures, the core inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, although it remained at a moderate level. The housing rental component increased more rapidly, reflecting the impact of earlier rises in private residential rents (Figure 2). Broader analysis showed that the growth of nominal labor costs and commercial property rents slightly accelerated, making local cost pressures more pronounced. As the inflation of some major import sources in Hong Kong rose, import price inflation also rose accordingly.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nLabor market conditions remained stable in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. The unemployment rates in most major service sectors declined, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector. With the further increase in total employment and private sector job vacancies, overall labor demand continued to rise, and the labor force participation rate also slightly increased. Under the tightening labor market conditions, real wages and income further increased.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Situation. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. The Hang Seng Index, driven by robust upward momentum in 2017, rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, the market's optimism rapidly reversed as major central banks tightened monetary policy, US-China trade tensions escalated, and slowing local economic growth caused investor concerns. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed at 25,846 points by year-end, a 13.6% decline from the previous year. Meanwhile, the average daily turnover increased from 88.2 billion HKD in 2017 to 107.4 billion HKD, and the total amount raised from initial public offerings in Hong Kong also rose significantly due to several companies in emerging and technology industries going public.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices. Source: Valuation and Rating Department, Inland Revenue Department, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018, but cooled down in the second half due to intensified U.S.-China trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and the rise in the most favorable interest rates in Hong Kong. Overall property prices fell by 9% from their peak between July and December, yet still recorded a 2% increase for the year (Figure 4). Due to a significant decline in transaction activities in the primary and secondary markets during the second half, the property transaction volume in 2018 fell by 7% to 57,247 units compared to the previous year. Additionally, housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both significantly higher than long-term averages. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but slightly retreated towards the end of the year. For the year as a whole, prices and rents continued to rise, while the rental yield remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to the slowing global economic growth, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will slow down in 2019. Particularly, the external environment is full of challenges, and Hong Kong's export performance is expected to remain under pressure. Locally, although the low unemployment rate and increased household income will continue to support private consumption, private consumption growth is expected to slow down partly due to the impact of weakened consumer confidence and the wealth erosion effect from earlier asset price adjustments. In terms of fixed capital formation, although with increased housing supply, construction and building activities are expected to grow steadily, businesses may become more cautious about capital investment facing increased economic uncertainties. The government predicts that the real GDP growth rate for 2019 will be between 2 and 3 percent, while the latest forecasts from private sector analysts average 2.3 percent.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nDue to the slowdown in global growth, including Hong Kong, external prices and local cost pressures are expected to ease, thus maintaining moderate inflation pressure in 2019. The recent decline in newly signed residential rental prices will also exert downward pressure on inflation. The market consensus forecasts the overall inflation rate for 2019 at 2.2%, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.5%. With sustained economic growth and the Hong Kong tourism sector remaining robust, labor market conditions are expected to remain tight. Private sector analysts anticipate the unemployment rate to stay around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Unclear Factors and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is influenced by uncertain factors and risks such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, mainland China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical situations. Additionally, if these uncertain factors intensify and persist for an extended period, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be significantly affected, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activities.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, and its outlook remains uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic outlook, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the Hong Kong property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment and income growth remain largely stable, which could support demand for residential properties. The trajectory of interest rates in Hong Kong to some extent depends on future changes in the US policy rate, but the latter's direction remains unclear. In the long term, due to increased residential completions in recent years and the government's efforts to increase land and housing supply, the housing supply-demand gap is expected to narrow.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite the increased external adverse factors, such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and interest rate normalization, which intensified financial market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained stable in 2018. The banking system's capital and liquidity positions remained sound, and asset quality remained good. Rising interest rates widened interest margins, stimulating a significant increase in bank profits.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trend\n\nThe banking system continued steady growth in 2018, with the balance sheet expanding by 5.9%. Facing continued economic uncertainties, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, businesses became more conservative in obtaining new loans. The total loan growth rate slowed to 4.4% during the year, down from 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing declined by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. The growth in related loans in mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Since most of these debt securities are investment-grade debt securities issued by the government and banks, the credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase than the 8.7% in 2017. Due to expectations of continued U.S. interest rate hikes, some banks raised their fixed deposit rates to attract depositors to convert their demand and savings deposits into fixed deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of demand and savings deposits in total deposits decreased from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to an increase in funding costs. As deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% by the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking system has ample capital, indicating it has strong buffers to withstand potential shocks. The capital ratio has reached a historical high since the implementation of Basel III; the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered and Authorized Institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation in the banking system. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, much higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system remains sound, reflecting their strong capacity to effectively withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. Regarding short-term liquidity (covering one-month-period funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","en":"#MonetaryStability\n\nIn 2018, interest rates for the Hong Kong dollar generally rose, while the HKD spot exchange rate weakened and approached the level of the weak-side exchange rate. Despite this, the foreign exchange and money markets in Hong Kong continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand significant shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, ensuring the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar remains stable, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts the currency issuance bureau mechanism, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, maintaining 100% alignment with changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Liability certificates (which fully back the banknotes issued by three issuing banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held by banks at the Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)\n- Foreign exchange fund instruments and bonds issued by the Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to the exchange guarantee. If the demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds its supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back down from the strong-side exchange guarantee rate to within the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back up from the weak-side exchange guarantee rate to within the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2018 in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an expanding negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which spurred carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the weak exchange rate guarantee mechanism, which had been set at the 7.85 level since 2005, was first triggered. In total, the weak exchange rate guarantee was triggered 27 times in 2018, with 13 triggers in April, 6 in May, and 8 in August. Despite this, the Hong Kong dollar market continued to operate smoothly and orderly, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering around the weak exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the proximity of holidays, quarter-end, and year-end, which tightened interbank liquidity and led to the liquidation of some carry trades. To some extent, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported by improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nDue to the activation of the weak-side exchange guarantee, the total balance and outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds decreased from 12,268 billion HKD at the end of 2017 to 11,362 billion HKD at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA, in accordance with the design of the linked exchange rate system (the Linked Exchange Rate System), purchased a total of 103.5 billion HKD at the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 upon banks' requests. As a result, the total balance decreased from 1,798 billion HKD at the end of 2017 to 764 billion HKD at the end of 2018. The total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds remained largely unchanged during the year. The monetary base continues to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds was 11,362 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of 2018 Balances and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nDue to reduced interbank liquidity following the activation of the weak currency exchange guarantee, as well as market expectations of US interest rate hikes, the Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally rose throughout 2018. Driven by increased funding demand related to new share issuance activities and seasonal liquidity demand, short-term interbank offered rates exhibited greater volatility (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank offered rates remained largely below the basic interest rate level throughout 2018. Given the rising funding costs in the banking system, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the adjustment of the Federal Reserve's target range for the federal funds rate in late September.\n\nIn response to the four increases totaling 100 basis points in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range during the year, the basic interest rate was raised by 100 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50% to 2.25% to 2.50%. The basic interest rate was adjusted on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, increasing from 1.75% to 2.75%. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Lending Rate\n\nThe discount in the forward exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar expanded during the first four months, roughly following the trend of the interest rate differential between the HKD and USD. The 12-month forward rate points for the HKD reached -620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Thereafter, as the negative interest rate differential between the HKD and USD narrowed, the discount in the HKD forward exchange rate slightly decreased, then expanded again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: 2018 USD\/HKD Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented in 1983, has always been a crucial cornerstone for maintaining monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong; it has demonstrated its ability to withstand strong shocks during multiple local and global financial crises. The weak-side exchange rate guarantee, an integral part of the system, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar. The outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar is an inevitable process in the normalization of interest rates and a normal operation under the Linked Exchange Rate System. To enhance public understanding of the operational mechanisms and technical details of the system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been actively explaining the intricacies of the Linked Exchange Rate System to the public and showcasing the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system in responding to shocks. The government remains resolute in maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces public confidence in the government's commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value. During the 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System, emphasizing that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong and a pillar of stability, which helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the substantial financial services sector.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal operation of the currency board system, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintains oversight of banks' corporate, property-related, and mainland-related loans to ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks. Banks hold a substantial amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds, which can be used through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The HKMA is also prepared to provide additional liquidity by adjusting the issuance volume of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds in response to the possibility of sudden capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. The HKMA also reminds the public to manage market and interest rate risks prudently and to be prepared for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018 without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the HKD exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources serve as a strong backstop to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2018\n\n# Monetary Issuance Committee\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee examined topics including the potential impact of coordinated exits from unconventional monetary policies by multiple central banks on the supply of U.S. dollar loans to offshore banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of the demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical framework of the exchange rate regime since the implementation of three optimization measures. The meeting records of the Monetary Policy Committee and the reports submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on the operation of the Monetary Authority system are both available on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Financial Research (HKIFR) continues to support research work in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. Over the past four years, the HKIFR has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, as evidenced by the seminars and visiting scholar programs it has organized. On one hand, the HKIFR collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to jointly host more policy-related seminars. On the other hand, in 2016, the HKIFR launched a special research scholar program to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the research center invited a total of 16 scholars for visits and published 25 research papers. Throughout the year, the center also hosted four international seminars:\n- The \"9th Annual International Conference on China's Economy,\" held in January, with the theme \"China's Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" The conference was co-organized by the research center, the Market Economy Research Institute of the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China, focusing on topics and risks related to the mainland's real estate market.\n- The \"Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework\" seminar, co-organized by the Monetary Authority and the International Settlement Bank, held in October. The seminar was one of the anniversary events marking the 20th anniversary of the bank's Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within the monetary policy framework.\n- The \"Annual Seminar on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure in 2018,\" held in November. The seminar discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and policy implications related to recent developments in financial market microstructure.\n- The \"China's New Era in Economic Development: China Experts Network Seminar,\" held in November, co-organized by the Monetary Authority, the European Central Bank, and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","en":"# Banking system stable\n\nDespite increased uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems of authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) throughout the year. Given the continued rise in cyber threats and the broader adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened regulatory oversight on technology risk management and business continuity capabilities of authorized institutions. In May, the HKMA issued the revised guidelines on the authorization of virtual banks and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to enhance regulatory oversight of sales practices for investment and insurance products by authorized institutions, promote accessible banking services for disabled individuals, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become more complex and globalized, the HKMA continues to leverage new technologies and risk-based approaches to enhance Hong Kong's capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA has made commendable progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large risk exposure limits. In addition, the HKMA has strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism for authorized institutions, which includes introducing rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle in the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it relies on establishing and maintaining a financial system with high resilience that can provide the essential financial services required by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their operational practices, or even in extreme cases, due to an unorderly collapse. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau plays a crucial role in ensuring financial stability by ensuring banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent collapses. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is responsible for prudentially supervising banks and licensing authorized institutions in Hong Kong, including licensed banks, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies. It also oversees the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely risk-free, and Hong Kong's prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution mechanism authorities, the Financial Secretary aims to ensure that, once an authorized institution is no longer viable, its orderly resolution can be carried out. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Financial Secretary serves as the resolution authority for a number of financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish an efficient Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the operational capacity of the HKMA to resolve non-viable authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the HKMA needs to adopt approaches that are consistent with and coordinated internationally.\n\n# 2018 in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted 187 off-site inspections in 2018, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, risk management, and the business strategies of authorized institutions in responding to the development of fintech. To further enhance the risk governance level of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of authorized institutions or committees under the boards, and followed up on the progress of authorized institutions in implementing corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 three-way meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site inspections and complement them with thematic assessments to examine areas assessed as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA conducted a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management in its reviews and assessments. Other key areas included technology risk and business operation risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel Capital Adequacy Framework. Special review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with the total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth in Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans in the mainland increased by 1.4% to 42,490 billion HK dollars at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Domestic Loan Growth\n\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions remained stable in 2018. The specific classified loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, far below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector decreased from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding mainland-related loans, the specific classified loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the relevant ratio for the overall banking sector also decreased from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA will strengthen its supervision to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the HKMA will proactively understand the background and structure of large enterprises, thereby enhancing the corporate credit risk monitoring system. In addition, the HKMA will conduct specialized assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as approval criteria and risk management for large enterprise loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for property developers' loans, and secured loans and policy collateral loans.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) since October 2009 have enhanced the Hong Kong banking system's ability to withstand potential reversals in the local property market. The average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages dropped from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt service-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the relevant ratio cap was first introduced, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Mortgage Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for Newly Issued Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nThe technology risks faced by the banking industry remain relatively high. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework.\" Phase One implementation plan covered 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed three stages of assessment: self-risk assessment, maturity assessment, and (if applicable) risk information-led cyber attack and defense simulation tests. These assessments have helped authorized institutions identify areas requiring improvement and take remedial measures to strengthen their cyber defense. Meanwhile, the HKMA has developed a timeline for Phases Two and Three implementation plans, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA conducted on-site inspections, focusing on reviewing the cybersecurity control measures, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Wisdom Bank\n\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with the banking industry on the seven measures introduced in September 2017 to promote smart banking, aiming to foster the development of fintech in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued revised guidelines on the recognition of virtual banks in May. Additionally, under the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has simplified regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online loans, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide better online banking user experiences. In September, the scope of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative was expanded to promote the adoption of financial compliance technology (Regtech) by banks. The three new focuses include monitoring technology for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, Regtech for prudential risk management and compliance, and machine-readable regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Man Kuet Hung, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018\" hosted by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n\n# Regulation of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs the US monetary policy continues to normalize, the HKMA has strengthened supervision of liquidity risks to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. This year, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic assessments to evaluate the preparedness of authorized institutions for the possible tightening of dollar liquidity and their ability to conduct internal liquidity stress tests. In addition, the HKMA monitored compliance by authorized institutions with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirement that took effect in January.\n\nThe HKMA, in addition to reviewing market risk management of authorized institutions' bond portfolios, conducted a special on-site review of the Global Foreign Exchange Code and margin and risk mitigation standards for non-central clearing OTC derivatives to examine the extent to which authorized institutions adhere to new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Fundraising\n\nThe Risk Assessment Report on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Hong Kong, published in April, points out that Hong Kong's banking system faces high money laundering threats, similar to other international financial centers, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats facing Hong Kong not only originate from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illegal proceeds from corruption abroad, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal organizations, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions due to Hong Kong's status as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the government has formulated a Policy Statement on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, which outlines responses to these threats. The objective is to enhance the capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing while also attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe 2018 Amendment to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance took effect on March 1, introducing revisions that grant flexibility in verifying customer identities to align with the development of recognized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account openings. The new legislation also expanded the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to take responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. These revisions, together with amendments to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, assist recognized institutions in carrying out their work against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTo strengthen and further enhance communication with authorized institutions on the regulatory approaches and policies of combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued in October a new section titled \"Regulatory Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\" under the Regulatory Policy Manual, as well as the revised \"Guidelines on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Applicable to Authorized Institutions)\" in conjunction with relevant legal amendments. This aims to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe role of information exchange in combating money laundering and terrorist financing systems is becoming increasingly important. Under the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association), the banking sector actively participates in the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group) and has already achieved substantive results. The review of the pilot program related to the Intelligence Working Group was initiated at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nStrengthening Hong Kong's position as an international financial center is one of the Monetary Authority's main responsibilities. Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries have made good progress this year, with the successful launch of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Quick Pay) serving as the best example.\n\nThe optimization measures introduced for the Stock Connect program between mainland China and Hong Kong, along with the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, have further strengthened Hong Kong's unique position as a primary gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong's status as an offshore RMB business hub has also become more solidified, with robust RMB financial activities in the territory.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is committed to pursuing new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA has also intensified its market promotion campaigns highlighting Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On the international stage, the HKMA plays leadership roles in numerous regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in related international endeavors.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub in Asia, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been committed to implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment industries. The main progress achieved during the year in implementing the seven measures to promote smart banking includes:\n\nSuccessfully launched the fast payment system \"Zhuanshu Kuai\", comprehensively connecting different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as \"electronic wallets\");  \nReleased the framework for the banking industry's open application programming interface (open API) and promoted the industry to implement open APIs;  \nEnhanced financial technology research and talent training;  \nStrengthened cross-border financial technology cooperation;  \nRevised the \"Approval of Virtual Banks\" guidelines and processed virtual bank license applications;  \nThe upgraded version of the \"Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) operates smoothly; and  \nExpanded \"Banking Easy\" to promote banks' adoption of financial compliance technology.\n\nThe Office for Fintech Promotion under the HKMA (FFO) plays an important role in promoting and implementing the aforementioned measures in collaboration with the HKMA's various banking departments.\n\nAs the optimization measures of the linkage plan between China's mainland and Hong Kong's capital markets are implemented, Hong Kong's unique position as a key gateway to the mainland further strengthens. The full implementation of the real-time gross settlement (DvP) settlement mechanism under the \"Bond Connect\" program, along with the State Council's announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors investing in China's domestic bond market, further enhances the program's efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also closely collaborated with mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial supporting measures, facilitating individuals and enterprises living, working, and conducting business in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). Offshore RMB business in Hong Kong continues to thrive, with the deposit funds pool increasing by 6% year-on-year to 657.7 billion yuan; the average daily transaction volume of the RMB real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system reached a high level of 1.0101 trillion yuan.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong's bond market, the HKMA has implemented the \"Bond Grant Pioneer Scheme\" proposed in the Budget, providing grants to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong. It has also closely collaborated with the government to revise relevant legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the \"Qualifying Debt Instruments Scheme.\" In addition, the HKMA has intensified market promotion activities, highlighting Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing various large-scale and specialized outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centers.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) leads multiple regional and international committees. The HKMA is currently serving as the Chair of the Regulatory Cooperation Standing Committee under the Financial Stability Board, the Chair of the Regulatory and Implementation Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. In 2018, four RTGS systems, the Debt Securities Central Settlement System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Storage Repository) achieved 100% system availability, surpassing the target level of 99.95%. The CMU system continued to assist in settling Bond Connect Northbound transactions through accounts with two central securities custody institutions in mainland China, as well as holding mainland debt securities for relevant CMU system members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the HKMA designated two more retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), subjecting their operations to HKMA supervision. As of now, the number of designated retail payment systems under HKMA supervision has increased to six. The HKMA also regulates 16 licensed stored value payment tool operators. These licensees actively launch new products and services, striving to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. At the same time, the coverage of electronic cheques and electronic bill and payment services has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 in Review\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aiming to help the banking industry reach a higher level and seize the significant opportunities brought by the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem during the year.\n\n# Fast Turnover\n\nThe Fast Transfer Service was successfully launched in September, enabling banks and value-added payment tool users to make instant cross-bank transfers of Hong Kong dollars and Chinese yuan anytime and anywhere. Users only need to input the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 value-added payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\n\"Fast Transfer\" has received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total amount of over 104.9 billion HK dollars and 2.75 billion RMB.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Shared QR Code Standard and the related mobile application \"HKQR\" in the same month. It is the world's first mobile application to integrate multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, making it convenient for merchants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to accept payment solutions from different payment service providers using a single QR code, without needing to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Interface\n\nOpen API refers to the practice of opening up banks' relevant data to third-party service providers, enabling more effective and convenient integration of banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment by using a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released an open API framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based principle and implements various open API functions in four stages. As of the end of January 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 open API interfaces in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Scientific Research and Talent Training\n\nLaunched in October by a consortium of Hong Kong banks, the trade finance platform \"TradeLink\" is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and builds upon the results of the trade finance concept validation led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade financing processes. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined as members of the consortium. In October, \"TradeLink\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a concept validation for connecting both platforms. The HKMA also explored opportunities for \"TradeLink\" to connect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connect Network.\"\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Monetary Authority (left), at the \"Trade Linkage\" launch ceremony.\n\nTo cultivate more fintech specialists, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the upgraded version of the \"Financial Technology Talent Cultivation Program\" (FCAS 2.0) in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January. FCAS 2.0 features four projects suitable for young talents at different career stages. Over 200 students have benefited from the program.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the left), Dr. Lam Ka-lik, Chairman of Digital Harbor (first from the left), Mr. Wang Ming-xin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Applied Sciences (second from the right), and Mr. Huang Ke-qiang, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Company (first from the right) attended the FCAS 2.0 Launch Ceremony.\n\n# Cross-border Cooperation\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continued to strengthen its fintech cooperation with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA's sponsorship of the \"Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program,\" which allows 50 students to intern at several renowned companies in Shenzhen for six weeks, experiencing the local fintech ecosystem; and the second joint organization of the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Award\" with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), is talking to the first batch of Shenzhen financial technology summer interns.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech cooperation agreements with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018 to promote fintech cooperation.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" plan. The network aims to provide innovative companies with more effective ways to interact with regulatory authorities and promote cooperation among regulatory authorities on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Bank\n\nIntroducing virtual banks will provide new momentum to Hong Kong's fintech applications and bring new experiences to digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and SMEs, thereby also helping to promote financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a revised version of the guidelines on \"Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May and received approximately 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nThe usage of the sandbox has been steadily increasing throughout the year. To help establish the financial compliance technology ecosystem, the sandbox was made available to financial compliance technology projects beginning in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 financial technology or technology products had been approved to use the sandbox for testing, of which 28 had completed trials and the related products were subsequently launched into the market. The HKMA also received an additional 220 cases using the \"Financial Technology Regulatory Chatroom,\" seeking regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech project development. Of these cases, approximately 70% came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","en":"# Reserve Management\n\n2018 was a challenging year for investors, as the investment environment was plagued by multiple risk factors, including the tightening of financial conditions caused by the continued normalization of US interest rates, escalating trade tensions between major economies, and rising populism and escalating geopolitical risks in various parts of the world. Global stock markets generally declined, and US Treasury yields also rose following the Federal Reserve's four interest rate hikes. With rising US interest rates, the dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe domestic political and economic pressures, leading to significant currency depreciation. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the sub-delegation.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) Ensure capital preservation;\n(b) Ensure that the overall monetary base is fully supported at all times by highly liquid U.S. assets;\n(c) Ensure that adequate liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Strive to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the Exchange Fund's portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid USD assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in debt and equity markets of OECD member countries to preserve asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo more effectively manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the HKMA is dispersing part of the Reserve Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and stocks are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Reserve Fund's accumulated surplus, plus the total amount of deposits from the Future Fund and the Reserve Fund's affiliated companies that are linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the Exchange Fund's investment performance assessment does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the allocation weights of the portfolios. By the end of 2018, the allocation of the Future Fund to the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, shows the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to perform tactical allocation in pursuit of returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark (i.e., strategic allocation), and the gap between actual and benchmark allocation is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limit. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the allowable strategic deviation range to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office in August to specialize in investment and related risk management functions. Staff of the office are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. These investment portfolios are invested in global fixed-income markets and implement the Foreign Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market to achieve sustainable returns, allowing the Foreign Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain insights from market expertise and professional investment techniques.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses primarily vary each year due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is highlighted. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has strengthened risk assessment to align with the increasingly diversified investments of the Exchange Fund; it also employs risk control tools to evaluate market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed factor analysis of investment performance to identify the causes behind different performance outcomes, thereby assessing how to fully leverage the investment management techniques of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Ordinance. These principles aim to assist investors in determining the best ways to fulfill their ownership responsibilities when investing in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance factors applicable to the selection, appointment, and supervision of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must adhere to the Principles of Responsible Ownership when managing such investments. Overall, the HKMA has incorporated environmental, social, and governance factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA closely monitors the development of relevant standards on environmental, social, and governance factors and evaluates how these standards can be further integrated into investment processes. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term objectives.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets of 2018\n\nIn 2018, multiple risk factors that had been underestimated by the market began to emerge one by one, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the impact of U.S. government trade policies and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks. Global financial markets thus experienced significant fluctuations and adjustments.\n\nThe escalation of the US-China trade dispute has caused investors great concern, with emerging markets and Hong Kong stocks experiencing repeated declines since the end of January, and the Hang Seng Index falling as much as 27% from its peak in that month. Starting from the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets also declined significantly, recording two-digit percentage drops. Overall for 2018, global stock markets generally declined, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market stocks, falling by 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also falling by 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose broadly in 2018 due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy. However, the bond market still experienced fluctuations during the year. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose from approximately 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a 7-year high of 3.2% in November, but by the end of the year, it declined to 2.7% due to investors' concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and a shift towards more conservative investments.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the US dollar strengthened throughout the year in line with US interest rate hikes. The US Dollar Index rose by 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the yuan depreciated against the dollar by about 5%. Additionally, some emerging markets were affected by domestic political instability and economic instability, leading to further declines in their currencies. For example, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira depreciated against the dollar by about 50% and 30% respectively. In contrast, the yen appreciated against the dollar by 2.7% driven by safe-haven investment demand.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, the bond market, and the stock market in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Return\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018, which included bond investment gains of HKD 57.4 billion, losses from Hong Kong stock investments of HKD 20.7 billion, losses from other stock investments of HKD 38.7 billion, a HKD 9 billion valuation decline on non-HKD assets due to foreign exchange valuation adjustments, and other investment gains held by the Foreign Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiary amounting to HKD 21.9 billion. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a HKD 5 billion valuation decline.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the total assets of the Foreign Exchange Fund reached 4,054.9 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was 283.6 billion Hong Kong dollars, with private equity accounting for 191.1 billion Hong Kong dollars and real estate accounting for 92.5 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total amount that has been committed but not yet drawn down for investment was 202.4 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset portfolios) had an investment return rate of 0.3% in 2018, with the investment portfolio returning -2.4% and the support portfolio returning 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has an annualized internal rate of return of 12.9% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the investment returns of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and the average investment returns for different periods.

In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA also launched an official Facebook page in July to further leverage social media to enhance communication with the public.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority (left), and the Environmental Bureau's mascot \"Da La Gui\" collaborated through social media to promote the use of \"Welcome New Year notes\" for giving red envelopes.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Inquiry Service serves as an effective channel for citizens to understand the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main functions and operations. In 2018, it handled 9,950 inquiries, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and banknotes and coins, particularly the coin collection program, banking products and services, guidelines and announcements related to the banking sector, the Fast Payment System \"FPS\", virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong new banknote series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received annually since 2015, while Figure 2 lists the proportion of each type of inquiry in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2018 Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the Authority published two Semi-Annual Reports on the Monetary and Financial Situation and four Quarterly Reports in 2018.

The first batch of 50 open API data sets was successfully launched in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash-in-transit vehicle schedules. The remaining 80 data sets will be rolled out in phases before mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to the HKMA's latest news and information on its website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website's design and content to make it more user-friendly. The newly redesigned website is expected to be launched within 2019.\n\nThe Financial Authority leads by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Phase 2, International Finance Centre, and aims to introduce the work of the Monetary Authority and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two parts: the Exhibition Hall and the Library, and is open to the public for visits six days a week.

The exhibition area underwent a renovation in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating various interactive elements, such as games that combine learning with fun, allowing visitors to gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency while enjoying the experience. Additionally, the Currency Exhibition Area features a new artistic Bauhinia tree, crafted from 2,018 transparent cubic blocks made from shredded banknotes no longer suitable for circulation, complementing another mosaic artwork in the exhibition area constructed from Hong Kong coins. The newly renovated Currency Exhibition Area reopened on August 16.\n\nThe information center provides guided tours for visitors.

As a public institution, the HKMA continuously streamlines work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The HKMA strives to maintain a streamlined and flexible organizational structure and, as much as possible, implements new measures and copes with the increasing workload through the reallocation of existing staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an employer that provides equal employment opportunities and ensures that employees can work in a discrimination-free environment. The Authority's equal opportunity policy applies to recruitment, compensation and benefits, performance appraisal, promotion, transfer\/training opportunities, and general conduct standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hires, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent work team to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly adapt to changes in work requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requires its employees to maintain high standards of integrity and ethics, always adhering to strict personal conduct and integrity norms, and prioritizing the best interests of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data - January 1, 2019\n\n# 2018 Organizational Structure Changes\n\nThe Office of the Fund Investment was established on August 1st, replacing the previous investment and related risk management functions that were managed by the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Supervision Department. The establishment of the Office of the Fund Investment highlights the Authority's investment functions, enhances its institutional image, and enables more flexible responses to market changes, thereby supporting the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Fund's investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing quota and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by department.\n\nTable 1: Position Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organizational structure of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office, but are consolidated under the Risk Management and Supervision Department to facilitate the presentation of their job functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the views of the Governance Committee under his jurisdiction, and references market salary levels and practices to determine the compensation and employment terms for HKMA staff. The compensation package includes cash compensation and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a performance-based annual bonus paid once a year.\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's employees annually, they seek advice from its governing committee through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, taking into account the governing committee's assessment of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a financial sector salary survey conducted by an independent human resources consulting firm, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding work performance may also receive special adjustments to maintain their competitive compensation.\n\nThe HKMA allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed and variable salaries based on individual employees' work performance; the variable salary system for employees responsible for investments aims to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. The adjustment of fixed salaries and the payment of variable salaries for employees at the level of Assistant Deputy Governor and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee, and these employees will abstain from meetings discussing salary-related proposals. For employees at the level of Manager and below, the adjustment of fixed salaries and the payment of variable salaries are decided by the HKMA Governor based on the Financial Secretary's authorization and in accordance with the entire approved amount allocated for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 contains the compensation data for senior management in 2018.\n\n1. The actual salary received by employees with less than one year of service, excluding accumulated annual leave, will be calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual salary for the respective position.\n2.

The number of senior personnel at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, the Officer of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Investment Office.\n3.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nReport by the Director of the Audit Office\nFinancial Statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Audit Office Director's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2018, the income statements, comprehensive income statements, statements of changes in equity, cash flow statements, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, covering the period ended on that date.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have fairly and adequately reflected, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2018, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Foundation of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. The responsibilities I have in relation to the audit of the financial statements are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I have been independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are the most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters during the audit and formation of my opinion on the entire financial statements, and I will not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the footnotes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for the same assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques, with the inputs used being based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of the financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total related financial assets amount to 27.5631 billion HKD, mainly comprising non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount involved and the estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nRegarding the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including relevant monitoring measures;\nEvaluate and test monitoring measures, including related application control measures in computer systems;\nObtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\nIf market quotations are used, verify the prices based on independent sources;\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, as well as verify the parameters based on independent sources; and\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate, as well as the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the footnotes to the financial statements 2.12, 20, and 21.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in 3 joint ventures and 20 associate companies, which primarily engage in holding overseas investment properties, with the total value of these interests amounting to HKD 44.336 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, regardless of whether held directly by the Group or through joint ventures or associate companies, is primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or through joint ventures and joint companies, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \nAssess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \nEvaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the relevant assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner must be responsible for other data. Other data includes all the data in the Financial Management Bureau's 2018 Annual Report, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I also do not provide any form of attestation conclusion on other data.\n\nIn relation to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information contains material inconsistencies with the financial statements or situations I became aware of during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that the other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer and the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants and the instructions given by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and implementing the internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Commissioner must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, as well as disclosing matters related to the going concern when applicable, and using the going concern as the basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any existing material misstatements. Material misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, may influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the process of conducting audits in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, fabrication, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to errors;  \nUnderstand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;  \nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the financial management commissioner are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \nDetermine whether the financial management commissioner's use of the going concern basis for accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that there are significant uncertainties, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I would issue an auditor's report with a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern;  \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present transactions and events; and  \nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I assume full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, major audit findings, and any significant internal control deficiencies identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee, explaining that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures where applicable.\n\nI will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the current financial statements, thereby forming key audit matters, based on communications with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report unless laws and regulations prohibit the public disclosure of a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where the negative consequences that would result from communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest, in which case I will decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nDirector of the Audit Office Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
