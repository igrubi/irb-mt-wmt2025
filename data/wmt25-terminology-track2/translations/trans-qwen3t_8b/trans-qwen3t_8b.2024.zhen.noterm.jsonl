{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","en":"# Stay Alert, Face the Storms\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority faced challenges head-on amid a complex external environment. Throughout the year, ongoing regional military conflicts, important elections in multiple countries, and an unclear global economic outlook kept the world situation volatile. However, policymakers around the world sought an appropriate balance between curbing inflation and supporting economic growth, driving major economies toward steady growth. Additionally, as the U.S. initiated its first rate cut in four years and a series of supportive economic policies were introduced domestically, market sentiment turned more optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains highly volatile.\n\nFaced with complex circumstances, our response strategy is to continue fully leveraging Hong Kong's hub role and unique advantages in offshore RMB business, fintech, and green and sustainable finance, thereby sustaining and consolidating Hong Kong's leading position as an international financial center. In 2024, the HKMA achieved significant progress in these key areas. Annual events such as the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit and various initiatives received enthusiastic responses, fully demonstrating the international community's firm confidence in Hong Kong's prospects as an international financial center.\n\nIn response to the periodic adjustments and structural transformation of the Hong Kong economy, we have closely collaborated with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviate their repayment burdens in a high-interest environment, and help them sustain development. In addition to the various policy measures introduced by the central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Hong Kong's economy has steadily recovered. In 2024, the Hong Kong economy recorded a mild growth of 2.5%.\n\nEntering 2025, the global economy continues to face numerous uncertainties amidst increasingly complex geopolitical situations. Rising trade protectionism and increased tariff barriers will lead to supply chain disruptions, intensified economic fragmentation, and add more variables to the global economic outlook. If geopolitical tensions further escalate, it could potentially cause a dual impact on the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFacing the complex and severe economic and financial environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will remain vigilant, sincerely fulfill our responsibilities, make every effort to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems, and continue to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. We will deepen our connections with various market stakeholders, actively promote the development of emerging fields, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains its leading advantage in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: Sound Foundation\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked Exchange Rate System) has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability for over 40 years, successfully withstanding the challenges of multiple economic and interest rate cycles, demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. interest rate policy in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar money market continued to operate smoothly under the mechanism of the HKD-USD system. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD. It slightly weakened during the first four months of the year due to liquidity tightening, but gradually strengthened afterward, approaching the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level by the end of the year. The stable exchange rate fully reflected market confidence in the HKD-USD system. At the same time, the HKD-USD system continued to receive high recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the exchange rate regime is based on our continuous and proactive efforts to explain the operational mechanisms and advantages of the exchange rate regime to the public, as well as rigorous market surveillance. By collecting detailed data and combining it with advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies, we conduct more timely and comprehensive market surveillance and financial stability assessments.\n\n# Banking System: Maintaining Stability Amid Multiple Challenges\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong banking system demonstrated strong resilience amid multiple macroeconomic challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining ample. By the end of 2024, the comprehensive total capital ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also sufficiently ample, with the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, surpassing the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. The specific classification loan ratio rose to 1.96% by year-end, influenced by factors including sustained high interest rates, unresolved debt issues of some mainland property developers, and a weak local commercial real estate market. However, due to banks' adherence to prudent credit risk management and maintenance of sufficient provisions, the related risks remained overall manageable.\n\nWhile closely monitoring banking credit risks, including those related to property mortgage loans, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented two rounds of adjustments to the countercyclical macro-prudential measures for property mortgage loans in 2024 in response to changes in property market conditions and related risks in the banking system. Specifically, the maximum mortgage-to-value ratio and the debt-service-to-income ratio cap for all residential properties were restored to their levels prior to the introduction of the countercyclical macro-prudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile continuously strengthening bank credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological resilience of banks to address the new challenges arising from increasing reliance on third-party service providers. Taking the CrowdStrike global incident in July last year as an example, this incident highlighted the potentially severe cascading consequences of operational failures in today's highly interconnected global environment. Although the incident had limited impact on the Hong Kong banking sector, it underscored the necessity for banks to ensure the establishment of robust frameworks, enabling critical business operations to continue even in the event of severe disruptions. Encouragingly, all banks in Hong Kong have now established operational resilience frameworks and are currently in the crucial phase of pairing work and scenario testing, identifying and remedying vulnerabilities to guarantee the continuity of critical business operations.\n\nAt the same time, to address the ever-evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority last year focused on enhancing the banking system's cybersecurity capabilities, including issuing new guidelines and conducting specialized reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulatory authorities to advance the cross-industry \"cyber map\" project, aiming to assess and address systemic cyber risks arising from the interconnectedness among financial institutions, financial market infrastructure, and technology service providers. Following the completion of the pilot phase in 2024, the project will be fully implemented this year.\n\nAnother major challenge brought about by technological development is the escalating threat of financial fraud, which is becoming increasingly sophisticated. This requires banks, regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the public to collaborate in addressing it. We have already requested banks to further enhance their online banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group) also expanded its coverage to include all major retail banks and six licensed payment institution operators, significantly improving the efficiency and scale of information exchange, resulting in an increase in seized criminal proceeds. Meanwhile, the legal amendment consultation on promoting inter-bank information sharing has received widespread support. This legislation will further enhance banks' ability to detect and prevent financial crimes.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures, enhancing public awareness of suspicious transactions and self-protection consciousness is equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and launched the \"Consumer Fraud Prevention Charter 2.0,\" introducing more participating institutions to expand the protection network and further safeguard the public. At the same time, we also launched the \"Smart Safe Deposit Service,\" allowing bank depositors to choose to separate part of their deposits for additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures to assist customers in preventing fraud, we also addressed the issue of individual customers who might borrow excessively due to impulse. Last year, we required retail banks to provide a minimum seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully reconsider and evaluate their financial responsibilities and repayment capacity after entering into a loan agreement. Meanwhile, the \"Credit Information Infrastructure Project\" (Xinzi Tong) was successfully launched last year, achieving significant progress in enhancing personal credit data services.\n\nIn addition to regulatory work, another key focus for 2024 is ensuring credit supply to support the real economy, which is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a vital pillar of Hong Kong's economy. Last year, we jointly launched the \"9+5\" support measures with the banking sector to help SMEs obtain bank financing to meet working capital needs and support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have committed not to require mortgage customers to repay loans on time or to reduce credit limits solely based on a decline in collateral value. As of now, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loan approvals, involving a total credit amount of 95 billion HKD. Banks have also set aside approximately 390 billion HKD in their loan portfolios specifically to support SMEs in sustaining development amid changing market conditions. Furthermore, the HKMA, together with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, established the \"SME Financing Task Force\" to provide support to SMEs from both individual cases and industry-wide perspectives. Given the current trade disputes and the uncertainty of the external economic outlook, we introduced three additional targeted support measures for specific industries in April 2025 to further strengthen support for SMEs across multiple sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall economic development of Hong Kong.\n\nIn maintaining banking system stability and enhancing operational efficiency, we have continuously promoted the application of technology in the banking sector and actively accelerated the adoption of fintech by banks. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have integrated fintech into their daily operations. Furthermore, recognizing the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening risk management in the banking sector, preventing fraud, and improving customer experience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation jointly launched the \"GenAI Sandbox\" last year to encourage banks to apply GenAI responsibly. We have also issued guidelines to banks, clearly stipulating that banks must ensure adequate customer protection if they use GenAI in customer-facing services. In addition, the HKMA has actively adopted GenAI technology internally to enhance analytical and regulatory efficiency. Apart from GenAI, we have also promoted closer ties between financial services and the tech sector by launching the new FiNETech series of events, establishing a matching platform called \"FintechConnect,\" and organizing a series of cross-industry exchange activities, thereby fostering collaboration and innovation within the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# Consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial center\n\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties of 2024, Hong Kong has maintained its leading position as an international financial center, and has continuously expanded and enhanced its influence in multiple areas and international influence.\n\nHong Kong plays an irreplaceable and unique role as a bridge connecting mainland China with international markets. By introducing various favorable measures and strengthening collaboration with all parties, Hong Kong continuously consolidates and enhances its position as a regional hub for fintech and sustainable finance. For specific work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Rapid Growth in RMB Business, Deepening Financial Cooperation with the Mainland\n\nIn 2024, the RMB business in Hong Kong continued to maintain a strong momentum, with significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, especially in offshore bank loans. The RMB real-time gross settlement system set a record for daily transaction volume, reaching 3.1 trillion yuan, reflecting the more prominent role of Hong Kong as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nAt the same time, we have continued to deepen financial connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland. The \"three-way connectivity, three conveniences\" policy introduced in 2024, along with six new measures announced early this year, have achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a 100 billion RMB trade financing liquidity facility, providing banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funds to expand RMB trade financing services and support the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough allows investors to use bonds held under the Bond Connect \"Northbound\" mechanism as eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB liquidity facility, the Hong Kong Clearing House's offshore RMB bond repurchase program, and other related initiatives. This innovative measure has enhanced the appeal of onshore bonds to offshore investors, facilitating greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. We also launched the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect 2.0\" last year, achieving comprehensive upgrades and optimizations, including a wider range of investment products, more flexible sales and marketing arrangements, and an expanded individual investment quota. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub but also further strengthen its role as a key gateway connecting the mainland with international markets.\n"}

The labor market remained robust, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. Hong Kong's stock market saw a significant rebound, while the property market remained largely weak due to subdued market sentiment under the prolonged high-interest rate environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the proactive implementation of economic stimulus measures by Mainland China, coupled with multi-faceted support for local enterprises, should help bolster business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international engagement and cooperation, as well as deepen regional collaboration.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remains stable, with capital and liquidity sufficiently ample, and overall asset quality remains under control.\n\n#CurrencyStability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical situations, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate depreciated in the first four months of 2024 and then strengthened for the rest of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently shown strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n#BankingSystemStable\n\nThe HKMA swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensured the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided regulatory guidance and supported the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational soundness and cybersecurity resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of fintech, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including the \"generative artificial intelligence sandbox.\"\n\nThe HKMA has introduced the \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Code of Practice 2.0,\" \"Smart Secure Storage,\" and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks, to enhance consumer protection in the banking sector. Additionally, the HKMA has provided guidelines for banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services, and introduced an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions, working closely with the industry. The HKMA has also issued guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimized the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" business pilot program, relaxed multiple restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit data services to \"Credit Information Express.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in the system for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. By strengthening the exchange and cooperation of information through the public-private partnership platform, the number of suspicious transaction reports has significantly increased, thereby enabling more effective confiscation of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legal revisions to promote information sharing among banks has received widespread support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes.

At the same time, after China's mainland announced and continued to implement economic stimulus measures, market sentiment in the mainland and Hong Kong has improved, and the government's various related support measures should further enhance the tourism industry in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong financial system, with its robust resilience and ample buffers built over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strive to promote the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and infrastructure. Facing the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, strive to quickly identify emerging risks, and flexibly respond. At the same time, we will actively seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund with caution and flexibility. We will make appropriate defensive arrangements and maintain high liquidity. We will also continuously diversify our investments, strive to enhance the long-term investment returns of the Exchange Fund, and ensure that the Exchange Fund can continue to effectively maintain the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\n# Stable and Sound Financial System\n\nUnder the new U.S. administration, policy directions are difficult to predict, leading to geopolitical economic fragmentation, and thus global economic uncertainty is expected to persist in 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bears the responsibility of promoting the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system, and will continue to remain vigilant, prevent various potential risks, ensure it stays informed about the latest developments, and be prepared to provide support to Hong Kong's economy at any time.\n\n# Stay Vigilant Against Potential Risks\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with the resilience and buffers established over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and instability factors in the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems. We will also study matters that affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintain the Stability of the Banking System\n\nThe uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the ongoing development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits but also introduce new operational and technological risks for banks. In response to the aforementioned environment, the HKMA will strive to enhance the banking sector's ability to withstand various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as maintaining continuous regulatory communication with individual banks and the broader industry. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory framework and supervisory approach in response to technological developments, changes in customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risks\n\nUnder pressure in the credit environment, the HKMA will continue to focus on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly in areas such as loan classification and provisioning, as well as problem loan management. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, and encourage authorized institutions to continue supporting the real economy while maintaining the principle of prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe uncertain outlook for interest rates in major advanced economies and the intensifying geopolitical tensions have led to greater volatility in global financial markets. In light of this, the HKMA will continue to take proactive measures to supervise market risk management by authorized institutions. In response to the unclear macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitalization of banking services, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risks to enhance their ability to handle sudden cash flow fluctuations.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue its work to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking system by reviewing the progress of banks in identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations and taking corrective actions, as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking industry on third-party service providers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will further strengthen banks' management of third-party risks and develop new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nIn terms of network defense resilience, the HKMA will assess systemic network risks through a cross-sectoral \"network map\" initiative. This project is being jointly advanced by the HKMA and other local financial regulators in accordance with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, we will review the implementation of banks' \"robust triple data backup\" arrangements and introduce a framework for network defense resilience testing, aiming to enhance banks' capacity to restore critical operations during severe cyber incidents.\n\nAlthough we have noted the benefits brought by the widespread adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI in the banking industry, we will remain vigilant, monitor emerging risks, and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other relevant stakeholders to maintain agility in our response, take proactive measures to prevent issues before they arise, thereby enhancing the bank's ability to combat digital fraud and guard against evolving fraudulent tactics.\n\n# Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Fundraising\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will introduce reforms, innovations, and other measures to enhance Hong Kong's overall capability to combat money laundering and terrorist financing ecosystems, reduce the threat from illegal capital flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the government's cross-departmental collaboration, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong, to deepen the understanding of potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments, and to develop effective and appropriately proportionate guidelines based on the assessment results, in alignment with the implementation of the new stablecoin issuer regulatory framework.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that bring public value. The related work includes strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activities, enabling banks to identify and prevent more fraud and shell companies, thereby further increasing the submission of high-quality and actionable information to law enforcement agencies.\n\nTo enhance the crackdown on fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendment recommendations to create the required pathways and safeguards for banks to share personal account information. To improve the speed and volume of detecting illegal capital flows, the HKMA will initiate work on a payment data analysis platform.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Related Services\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will conduct on-site and off-site reviews of authorized institutions in securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF). We will focus on monitoring high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, the Cross-border Wealth Management Connect program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long-term insurance products, and premium financing services, and will refer to the latest market developments and revised international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will closely coordinate with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector to provide guidance on the regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investment, insurance, and MPF products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital assets industry, we will continue to collaborate with the government and other regulatory bodies to ensure the establishment of a robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework for the digital assets industry.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA will promote and monitor the implementation of the optimization measures for the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" by the industry, and continue to communicate with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to further optimize the plan and other cross-border initiatives related to banks.\n\nWe will also integrate and clarify the current guidelines related to wealth management and MPF, to help the industry better understand the HKMA's regulatory requirements and facilitate compliance.\n\n# Formulate Policy\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe final reform package of Basel III will take effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to provide guidance and clarification to authorized institutions regarding common issues in the interpretation of the final reform package, ensuring consistent adoption by the industry.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards on prudently managing risks associated with crypto assets in December 2022, followed by targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. Meanwhile, the Basel Committee also published a document titled \"Disclosure of Crypto Asset Risk Exposure,\" which outlines updated disclosure requirements for crypto asset risk exposure. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, the HKMA will study the necessary legal amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules (Risk Exposure Limits Rules), and Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose several optimization suggestions for the Risk Exposure Limits Rules based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will conduct a formal consultation on the amendments in the first half of 2025 to align with the Basel Committee's timeline and implement the new standards on January 1, 2026. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking reporting forms and supplementary guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the new standards by authorized institutions.\n\n# Other Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches, and developments in the banking industry, the HKMA plans to update multiple sections of the Regulatory Policy Manual, including CA-G-5 \"Regulatory Review Procedures,\" CA-B-2 \"Systemically Important Banks,\" IC-5 \"Stress Testing,\" IR-1 \"Interest Rate Risk within a Bank's Balance Sheet,\" and IC-3 \"Requirements for Approved Institutions to Submit Reports on External Auditors in Accordance with the Banking Ordinance.\" The section CR-G-13 \"Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" of the Regulatory Policy Manual will be revised to reflect the sound practices outlined in the Basel Committee's \"Guidelines on Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" issued in December 2024.\n\n# The Basel Committee's Main Principles for the Effective Regulation of the Banking Sector\n\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised \"Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" (the Principles) in April 2024. The revised Principles reflect developments in regulation and supervision since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a detailed self-assessment in 2025 to ensure its regulatory and supervisory framework complies with the revised Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue a consultation draft on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will collaborate with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed dynamic risk management accounting model on existing prudential regulatory requirements.\n\n# Law Enforcement\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority consulted the banking industry in 2024 on proposals to expand the investigative and enforcement powers of the Financial Management Officer to ensure that they still possess the necessary authority to effectively perform their duties under the Banking Ordinance. After considering the opinions received during the consultation, the HKMA will adjust the proposal and draft the necessary legal amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Disposal Mechanism\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority is continuing a multi-year project to establish a smoothly operating resolution mechanism for authorized institutions. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritize the following areas of work (Table 1):\n\nTable 1: Key Work Focus of the 2025 Disposal Mechanism\n\n# Handling Policy and Standards\n\nConduct consultations on the practical guidelines regarding the approach taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for valuations in disposal cases, as well as the pre-existing capabilities and arrangements that recognized institutions must have to support timely and prudent disposal valuations, and complete the relevant development work. Advance the work on developing policy standards for disposal restructuring.\n\n# International and Cross-border Cooperation\n\nParticipate in work related to the development and effective implementation of international resolution policies, particularly the Financial Stability Board's 12 resolution mechanism reform measures planned for 2025 through its Resolution Mechanism Oversight Group and various working groups.\n"}

The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Commissioner dated June 25, 2003, outlines the allocation of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also reveals that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Financial Management Commissioner. This letter is a public document and can be accessed on the website of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system (while at the same time taking into account the Exchange Fund's main purpose), thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner, appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, assists the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the ordinance, as well as functions under other ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Management Commissioner is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Financial Management Commissioner is the Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, exercising its duties and powers under the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking business and deposit-taking business. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is responsible for handling the licensing of Hong Kong-licensed banks, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies.\n\nThe Regulation on the Resolution Mechanism for Financial Institutions stipulates that the Financial Secretary is the authority responsible for the resolution mechanism of financial institution entities.

Therefore, it has always been committed to upholding high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill the commitment to good corporate governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\nEstablished a clear organizational governance framework;\nMaintained high accountability and transparency, and maintained close communication with all stakeholders; and\nImplemented robust and comprehensive monitoring measures to manage risks and ensured that the behavior of all employees at all levels and their daily operations comply with the specified standards.\n\nThe governance structure of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority covers several main components, including various statutory advisory committees that provide opinions and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audits.\n\n# Monetary Authority and the Government of the Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government), but it may hire staff under employment terms different from those of civil servants to attract qualified personnel with appropriate experience and expertise. The Governor and staff of the HKMA are public officials. The HKMA's daily operations enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the legal powers conferred or delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting the monetary policy objectives and the monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Financial Management Commissioner, the Financial Secretary stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through the Monetary Authority system, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Financial Secretary for Economic and Fiscal Affairs and Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Management Commissioner include:\n\nPromote the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\nCollaborate with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\nHandle matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\nThrough the development of payment, settlement, and clearing systems, as well as being responsible for operating the relevant systems under appropriate circumstances, promote the security and efficiency of financial infrastructure; and\nCollaborate with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in the Hong Kong currency and financial system, and implement appropriate market development measures to assist in enhancing the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary regarding the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Management\n\n# Advisory Committee\n\nThe Consultation Committee provides opinions and guidance on the main areas of work of the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and provides advice to the Financial Secretary on matters related to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Financial Management Officer) are appointed by the Financial Secretary with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience, which benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees under its jurisdiction, responsible for overseeing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in specific areas and providing opinions, and reporting and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the advisory committee. For details on the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five specialized committees, please refer to pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Banking Advisory Committee and the Deposit-Taking Companies Advisory Committee provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on matters concerning the Banking Ordinance, particularly regarding the operation of banking business or deposit-taking business (as the case may be) by banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted license banks. Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, with members including the Financial Secretary and other persons appointed by the Financial Secretary under the Chief Executive's authorization. For details on the Banking Advisory Committee and the Deposit-Taking Companies Advisory Committee, please refer to pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management Layer\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Monetary Authority consists of the Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive, and other senior officials, with the Chief Executive serving as Chairman. The Board holds regular meetings to report to the Chief Executive on the progress of key work across all departments of the Monetary Authority and to provide opinions on policy matters related to its operations. For the list of Board members, please refer to pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nIn terms of the methods used in daily operations and the implementation of government policy objectives, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has always maintained a high degree of autonomy, and at the same time been supported by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is appointed by the Financial Secretary, hence the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the HKMA's authority is established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibilities, promoting public awareness of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. While carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive contact with society, the HKMA strives to enhance transparency and uphold an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n\nStrive to ensure the financial sector and the public have a thorough understanding of the HKMA's work, taking into account legal restrictions related to market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and the disclosure of confidential information; and ensure the HKMA understands societal trends and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center and promoting the development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nThe HKMA must gain public trust to effectively fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, the HKMA rigorously fulfills its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive contact with the media and utilizes social media platforms to more effectively communicate with the public in the digital age. The HKMA also strives to address issues that are widely concerned by society and fall within its scope of responsibilities, particularly through traditional and social media to promptly clarify false information and rumors related to its policies.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's office has an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, open six days a week to the public for visits and use. Details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work related to communication and contact with the public can be found in the \"Institutional Functions Chapter\" (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on the Authority's各项工作 and policies, and to answer relevant inquiries. The briefings given by the Governor to the Financial Affairs Committee are published on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\nIn addition, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority occasionally attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Standing Committee and Sub-Committees to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft bills.\n\n# Information Disclosure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency and publishes a variety of Chinese and English journals and special publications. The bilingual website of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (www.hkma.gov.hk) not only features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, but also hosts numerous publications, press releases, speeches, and presentation documents issued by the HKMA.\n\nThe HKMA periodically reviews whether the disclosure of the Exchange Fund and Currency Issuance Department's financial statements is sufficient. The HKMA began participating in the IMF's Central Bank \"Data Publication Standards\" program in 1999. The HKMA also publishes meeting minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as operational reports on the Currency Issuance Department's system. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has contained banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\n# Internal Control and External Audit\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective monitoring mechanisms to ensure adherence to high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments on whether the monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the behavior of all employees at all levels complies with the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\n\n# Operation Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches have the responsibility to identify and assess risks in their workflows, and to develop appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the stability of the Monetary Authority's daily operations.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Governor of the Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as the adequacy of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority independently assesses the sufficiency and effectiveness of the governance processes, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments and provides improvement recommendations.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Foreign Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Audit Department does not charge fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund are published in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n"}

The labor market remained stable, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures further eased. The local stock market significantly rebounded, while the property market remained largely weak due to market sentiment being pressured under a sustained high-interest environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, it is expected that Hong Kong's economy will face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the proactive economic stimulus measures introduced by mainland China, along with comprehensive support provided to local businesses, should help reinforce business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international engagement and cooperation, as well as deepen regional collaboration.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong economy grew moderately in 2024. Real local GDP increased by 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, following a 3.2% rise in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Externally, goods exports rebounded to positive growth, driven by improved external demand and the recovery of the global tech cycle, becoming the main driver of overall economic growth. Service exports also further increased, driven by the continued recovery of the Hong Kong tourism industry and a significant rise in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half. However, service imports significantly increased due to the sustained growth in outbound tourism, offsetting the positive impact of service exports on overall economic growth. Locally, private consumption expenditure softened due to changes in consumption patterns among local residents. In contrast, increased property transactions and an improved business climate, driven by the gradual easing of monetary conditions, led to a slight increase in overall investment expenditure.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of components to the growth of real local GDP\nData source: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\nNote: The local fixed capital formation total adjusted for seasonality does not specify the quarterly increase or decrease.\nData Source: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nDespite the gradual increase in newly signed private residential rental prices, local cost pressures remained largely under control, and external price pressures gradually eased, keeping local inflation moderate in 2024 (Figure 2). For the full year of 2024, the core and overall inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe labor market showed resilience in 2024, with the unemployment rate hovering between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Figure 3). Since the first quarter, total employment numbers (Figure 3) gradually increased, and the labor force also saw growth, reflecting that labor demand and supply remained largely stable. At the same time, as the economy continued to grow, nominal wages and labor income both saw steady growth. In addition, the government announced in the 2024 Policy Address the further optimization of Hong Kong's talent attraction program to alleviate manpower shortages in various industries and to inject new vitality into the local population by incorporating more young people.\n\nFigure 2 Core Consumer Price Inflation Data Source: Government Statistics Department\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Situation. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market significantly turned around in 2024 following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, as the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates and mainland China implemented proactive economic stimulus measures, market sentiment improved significantly, driving the Hang Seng Index to its annual high of 23,100 points on October 7 (Figure 4). However, concerns about the global economic outlook and the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy easing, triggered by the U.S. presidential election held in early November, led to a slight retreat in Hong Kong's stock market. Despite this, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points by year-end, representing a significant 17.7% increase from the end of 2023, ending four consecutive years of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained largely sluggish during the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. Supported by the relaxation of related policies in late February and mid-October, as well as the interest rate reduction cycle starting in September, the annual residential transaction volume rose significantly by 23.5% from the historical low of 43,002 units in 2023 to 53,099 units in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage rates and accumulated inventory in the new property market continued to exert downward pressure on property prices. As a result, property prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, leading to a slight improvement in purchasing affordability, although it remained relatively tight. The non-residential property market remained weak. Among them, office building vacancy rates remained high despite ample supply, while retail shops faced challenges due to changes in consumer patterns among both tourists and local residents.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices. Source: Valuation and Rating Department, Inland Revenue Department, Hong Kong and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nGiven the escalating trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and capital flows, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the comprehensive support provided by relevant authorities and the banking sector should enhance the resilience of local enterprises. The mainland's active implementation of economic stimulus measures and significant breakthroughs in frontier technology sectors are also expected to boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and accelerate integration with emerging markets. Meanwhile, under the mainland's favorable tourism policies for Hong Kong and the government's efforts to boost the Hong Kong tourism industry, the tourism sector is expected to experience further growth.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. Due to the gradual transmission of rising housing rents to consumer prices, local costs may face mild upward pressure. However, although global economic outlook uncertainty has increased, external price pressures are expected to remain moderate. On the other hand, the labor market may face challenges due to the escalation of trade tensions. However, various talent attraction programs should help continue building a high-quality talent pool to support long-term economic development.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2024, with banks' capital and liquidity being very ample. Amid a macroeconomic environment full of challenges, credit risks faced by the banking system increased during the year, but the overall asset quality of banks remained under control. Retail banking profits increased compared to 2023, benefiting from higher investment gains from trading holdings and increased fee and commission income.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe specific classified loan ratio of the banking system rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio increased from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). The increase in the specific classified loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loan ratings for some mainland real estate developers and local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the specific classified loan ratio for related loans in mainland China decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024. Bank provisions remained adequate. As of the end of 2024, the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., credit provisions and specific classified loan ratio) was approximately 65%. After deducting the realizable value of collateral from the non-performing loan balance, the adjusted credit provision coverage ratio was approximately 145%. At the same time, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans at the end of 2024 remained at low levels, at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6: Default rate of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\nData source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nRetail banking's overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the post-tax average return on assets rose from 0.88% to 0.93% during the same period (Figure 7). The profit growth was mainly driven by investment gains from trading securities (+97.0%) and increased fee and commission income (+15.4%), although part of the increase was offset by a decline in net interest income (-5.2%). The net interest margin for retail banking narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). Meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banking slightly increased from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking. Data Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking. Data Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 9: Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banking – Data Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Trend\n\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, mainly due to an increase in transferable debt instruments (+13.4%). Due to high lending costs, loan demand was suppressed, resulting in a 2.8% decrease in total loans in 2024. Loans used in Hong Kong decreased by 2.1%, while those used outside Hong Kong decreased by 5.7%. Trade financing, however, increased by 4.6%. Loans related to mainland China decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nIn terms of liabilities on the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to a 5.1% increase in 2023. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking system sustained ample capital in 2024. As of the end of 2024, the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered and authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio at the end of 2024 was 8.0% (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System.

Data Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions. Data Source: HKMA.\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system remains robust. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Figure 13). The primary source of funds for the banking system remains customer deposits. By the end of 2024, the net stable funds ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funds ratio for Category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four of the aforementioned ratios significantly exceeded the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 14: Capital Ratio of Designated Approved Institutions.

The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened during the first four months of 2024 but strengthened for the rest of the year. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate generally follows the trend of U.S. interest rates while also being influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, ensuring the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar remains stable, keeping the exchange rate against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts the currency issuance bureau mechanism, stipulating that the foreign exchange reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base. Any changes in the monetary base must be fully matched by corresponding adjustments in the foreign exchange reserves.\n\nMonetary base (Table 1) includes:\n\nLetter of Credit (fully backing the banknotes issued by three issuing banks);  \nGovernment-issued circulating banknotes and coins;  \nTotal balance of settlement accounts maintained at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance); and  \nForeign exchange fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to the exchange guarantee. When the strong side (or weak side) exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon banks' requests, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars at 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) total reserves, leading to a decrease (or increase) in the Hong Kong interest rate, and thus prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange band of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n#2024 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar slightly weakened as liquidity weakened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate strengthened, mainly supported by dividend-related funding demand and active stock market trading. In early August, due to market concerns about a potential U.S. economic recession and expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting rates more aggressively and significantly, this triggered unwinding of carry trade positions and covering of Hong Kong dollar short positions, causing the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen to the strong side of the exchange guarantee range. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from the surge in local stock market trading activity following the announcement of a series of economic stimulus measures by mainland China. The Hong Kong dollar then slightly weakened in early November, partly due to the receding rise in local stock prices, and partly because the strong U.S. economic performance at the time gave the Federal Open Market Committee space to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded due to seasonal funding demand at the end of the year. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rate\n\nSince there was no trigger for the exchange guarantee during the year, total reserves remained largely unchanged, staying around 44.7 billion HKD. At the same time, the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds increased slightly from 12,455 billion HKD to 13,839 billion HKD. Therefore, the total reserves plus the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds rose from 12,904 billion HKD at the end of 2023 to 14,287 billion HKD at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base continues to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2 Summary Balance for 2024 (before discount window operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS), Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of US interest rates, with short-term rates also influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations for a reduction in US policy rates have gradually increased, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) generally softened during the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3). Driven by seasonal funding demand at the end of the quarter and active stock market trading, HIBOR tightened in late September, with overnight HIBOR reaching above 6% at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, HIBOR remained largely stable, but rose towards the end of the year due to relatively reduced liquidity. On an annual basis, overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) each fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points, respectively, to 5.65%, 4.58%, and 4.37% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the reduction in the U.S. federal funds rate target range, the basic interest rate was cut three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), falling from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). In the retail sector, as the U.S. lowered its policy interest rates, many banks reduced their prime loan rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further reduced them by 25 basis points in early November and 12.5 basis points in late December. In this context, the average rate for new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from 38.8 billion HKD in 2023 to 50 billion HKD in 2024; the usage of the discount window showed no abnormalities.\n\nFigure 3: 2024 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a key pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in facing challenges. Despite uncertainties in the trajectory of US policy interest rates and geopolitical fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets have remained orderly, reflecting the robust and effective nature of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government remains resolute in maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated in its 2024 Article IV Report that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions that are exceptionally ample according to international standards. To ensure the banking system has the resilience to withstand shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintaining oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Issuance Office's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the trigger threshold of 112.5% (Figure 4). This increase was mainly due to interest income from investments and the revaluation of investments at market value. According to the arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, assets were transferred from the support portfolio to the investment portfolio, reducing the support ratio to around 110.08% on September 11. The support ratio remained largely stable afterward, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the support portfolio, all assets of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial fiscal resources, combined with Hong Kong's sound banking system, provide a strong backing for the maintenance of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2024\n\n# Monetary Issuance Committee\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2024, the Monetary Policy Committee examined topics including the risk exposure of Hong Kong's banking sector towards non-bank financial institutions, as well as the latest monetary policy implementation frameworks of major advanced economies. Meeting records of the Monetary Policy Committee and the operational report on the Monetary Authority system submitted by the HKMA to the committee are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\nFigure 5: Circulation Amount of Banknotes Classified by Issuing Banks as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 6: Distribution Status of Circulating Banknotes as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 7: Circulation Amount of Bank Paper Money as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 8: Circulating Amount of Government-Issued Paper Money and Coins as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Paper Money and Coins by the End of 2024\n\n# Hong Kong Notes\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 14 lectures on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank counter staff, retail store cashiers, and students, helping to enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coin Collection Plan\n\nThe Coin Collection Program continues to be popular among citizens. Details of the program are included in the \"Sustainability of the Monetary Authority\" chapter of the 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\n# US Dollar Working Capital Arrangement\n\nThe HKMA has introduced optimized measures for the USD liquidity arrangement, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This regular liquidity arrangement provides backup liquidity to licensed banks when needed, particularly in the context of the US implementing a settlement cycle shortened to T+1 starting on May 28.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the nominal total value of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds was approximately HKD 1.3068 trillion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Currency Study\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMFR), under the School of Finance, published 15 research papers on strategic monetary and financial issues relevant to Hong Kong and the region, and shared their research findings with a global audience through five open-access e-journals.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","en":"#BankingSystemStable\n\nDespite facing macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, the Hong Kong banking system maintained stability in 2024. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, ensured banking system stability through risk-based supervision and contingency planning, and provided regulatory guidance and support to the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of fintech, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including a generative artificial intelligence \"sandbox.\"\n\nThe HKMA has introduced the \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Charter 2.0\" to enhance consumer protection in the banking sector. We have also launched \"SmartSafe Deposit\" to help depositors effectively protect their funds, as well as introduced a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA has provided guidelines to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and introduced an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions, working closely with the industry. The HKMA has also enhanced customer experience and ensured investor protection by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program, and streamlining procedures for the sale of investment and insurance products. This year, the HKMA has completed the full transition of personal credit data services to \"Credit Information Express.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in Hong Kong's system for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. By increasing the speed and volume of information exchanged through the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the number of intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports rose by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% increase in frozen or confiscated proceeds from criminal activities. The consultation on legal revisions to promote information sharing among banks to assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes received widespread support. In April, the HKMA issued guidelines based on the special review of the Transaction Monitoring System, and in September, launched a plan to promote the application of artificial intelligence in monitoring suspicious activities. The HKMA also collaborated with the banking industry and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimize the \"suspicious account alert\" mechanism and enhance publicity efforts, and issued guidelines to banks on preventing, detecting, and stopping authorized payment fraud.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Corporation has optimized various aspects of the deposit protection scheme to enhance safeguards for depositors.\n\nTo ensure the credibility of the resolution mechanism, the HKMA has implemented resolution standards requiring banks to update financial contracts with counterparties, thereby reducing the risk of early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing obstacles to resolution feasibility to ensure sufficient financial resources and operational continuity during resolution, as well as enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the objectives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it relies on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system that can provide the essential financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system due to their operational practices, or even in extreme cases, due to an uncontrolled collapse. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Services Commissioner plays a crucial role in ensuring financial stability by guaranteeing that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and manage crises, ultimately helping to prevent collapses. The Financial Services Commissioner is responsible for prudential supervision of banks and for licensing authorized institutions in Hong Kong, including licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies.\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" In fact, as the resolution mechanism authority, the Financial Secretary strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its collapse can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Financial Secretary serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions. To implement Hong Kong's resolution mechanism, we need to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the operational capacity of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to handle authorized institutions on the brink of collapse. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts a method consistent and coordinated with international standards.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supervises financial market infrastructures with the aim of promoting their overall safety and efficiency, reducing systemic risks, and enhancing transparency. Enhancing the resilience of financial market infrastructure against financial crises can ensure the safety of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems and prevent disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructure from affecting their stability.\n\n#2024 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nThe HKMA granted banking licenses to a bank incorporated as a company in Hong Kong and another bank incorporated as a company outside Hong Kong during the year. The HKMA also approved a merchant broker based outside Hong Kong to become a money broker. In addition, the HKMA revoked the recognized qualifications of three licensed banks, one restricted license bank, and one deposit-taking company during the year.\n\nFor more information about Hong Kong's accredited institutions and local representative offices, please refer to the appendices and tables D to F listed on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323, respectively.\n\n# Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed a public consultation on simplifying the banking three-tier system to a two-tier system, with respondents generally supporting the simplification proposal. After considering the feedback received, the HKMA introduced several new key points to streamline the transition process and minimize the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# Renaming \"Virtual Bank\"\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed a public consultation on renaming \"Virtual Bank\" to \"Digital Bank.\" The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the Authority subsequently revised the statutory guidance \"Recognition of Digital Banks\" in October, with the proposal officially taking effect.\n\n# Review of Digital Banking\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banking, with the review report published in August. The review indicated that digital banking has achieved the three policy objectives for introducing digital banks in Hong Kong: promoting fintech and innovation, providing new customer experiences, and promoting financial inclusion. Under the diversified development of digital and traditional banks, the HKMA believes the current number of digital bank licenses is appropriate, and there is no need to introduce more digital bank participants into the market at this stage. The revised guidelines issued in October, \"Recognition of Digital Banks,\" relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking services beyond retail banking, and permitting the establishment of physical branches under conditions deemed reasonable from the perspectives of customer experience and business strategy, provided that digital banks continue to primarily deliver banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Bank License Fees\n\nThe Monetary Authority completed the review of licensing fees within the year and raised the fee level in June.\n\n# Hong Kong Company Registration Transfer System\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has provided support to the government in introducing a company deregistration system in Hong Kong, including assisting in the revision of the Banking Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, as well as the legislative procedures for other relevant legislation related to the HKMA.\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 174 off-site inspections, covering a wide range of areas, including the CAMEL evaluation, corporate governance, and risk management of authorized institutions. To continue enhancing the risk management standards of authorized institutions, the Authority held 36 meetings with the boards, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. In addition, the Authority carried out on-site inspections of various operations of authorized institutions, including governance and practices related to credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the growing adoption of technology by authorized institutions, operational and technology risk management has become another regulatory focus. The HKMA has also further strengthened its supervision of climate risk management for authorized institutions to enhance their capacity to respond to climate change. The HKMA's efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting steady economic growth amidst an uncertain global economic environment have been recognized, earning it the title of \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" from The Asian Banker.\n\nMs. Zhu Liqiao, Assistant Vice President (Bank Supervision), representing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the \"Asia-Pacific Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Agency Award\" presented by the magazine \"Asia Banker\".\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections on authorized institutions' securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, as well as consumer protection matters, and uses thematic assessments as a complement to review new items or areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Regulatory Work\n\na. Additional regulatory work focusing on operational soundness includes an investigation by the Authority and self-assessments by authorized institutions to review implementation progress and identify areas requiring improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at bilateral and industry levels regarding the framework and practices.  \nb. In addition, regulatory efforts focus on assessing the strategies and approaches of authorized institutions in approving specific credit portfolios and managing ongoing risks, such as commercial property and SME loans.  \nc. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the Authority's 'Regulatory Policy Manual' section GS-1 'Climate Risk Management'.\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe total loan amount in 2024 decreased by 2.8%, while the decline in 2023 was 3.6%. Table 2 shows the growth rates of various loans and advances. The total amount of related loans in mainland China decreased by 8.7% to 38,590 billion HK dollars (Table 3).\n\nGiven that interest rates remain high, some mainland real estate developers' debt issues have not been fully resolved, and the local commercial property market remains weak, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. The banking system's asset quality continued to face pressure during the year, but the risk situation remained controllable. The banking system's specific classification loan ratio was 1.96% at the end of 2024, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the specific classification loan ratio for related loans in mainland China fell from 2.58% to 2.38% during the same period.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a special assessment to review credit risk management of authorized institutions, with a focus on risk exposure in vulnerable industries, risk exposure for secured and unsecured retail loans to private banking and wealth management clients, monitoring of credit risks in offshore businesses, and risk exposure from non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nTable 3: Growth of Mainland-related Loans\n\n# Alleviate Cash Flow Pressure for Bank Customers\n\n# Support Local SMEs\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a vital pillar of Hong Kong's economy, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing.

These include optimizing the \"Cross-border Finance Channel for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,\" expanding the eligible collateral scope for the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangement and the \"Northbound Swap Facility,\" optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Facility,\" and improving the primary liquidity provider arrangements. These measures help strengthen Hong Kong's role as a gateway and reinforce its position as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made solid progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centers. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts targeting overseas and mainland stakeholders, enabling them to fully recognize the stability of Hong Kong's financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and other major events were successfully held, not only helping to enhance Hong Kong's image as a major international financial center but also generating a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory bodies, continuing to contribute to global initiatives aimed at maintaining financial stability and promoting the development of financial markets.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in all areas of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe number of registrations and transaction volume for the Quick Pay system continues to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024, with the average daily processing of HKD instant transactions increasing to 1.65 million. The HKMA is closely cooperating with the People's Bank of China to promote the implementation of the connection between Hong Kong's Quick Pay and the mainland's cross-bank payment system for online transactions, facilitating cross-border payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to strive to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\nExpanding and optimizing the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland helps consolidate Hong Kong's role as a bridge between the mainland and international financial markets. This year, several optimization measures related to the \"Cross-border Financial Services\" (CFS) program were introduced, facilitating cross-border investments for individual investors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). In February, the HKMA included onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China and policy-related financial bonds issued by mainland policy banks in the eligible collateral list under the RMB liquidity arrangement. In July, relevant authorities from both sides announced further support for overseas investors to use onshore bonds held through \"Bond Connect\" as collateral for transactions under the \"Northbound Swap Facility\" (NBSF), which was implemented in January 2025. Additionally, the NBSF was optimized during the year, enhancing investors' flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's offshore RMB business experienced steady growth. The HKMA introduced optimization measures for the Primary Liquidity Provision Arrangement, including increasing the number of participating institutions and expanding the scale of the arrangement. By the end of the year, the Hong Kong RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System's cross-border service capabilities during nighttime hours were enhanced to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple measures benefiting the public and facilitating business under the Greater Bay Area financial cooperation, including a cross-border credit information sharing pilot program to promote corporate cross-border financing, as well as cross-border remittance arrangements to facilitate Hong Kong residents' property purchases in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's overall financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong's appeal as a preferred fund management center and family office business hub, the Authority closely collaborates with the government and financial sector to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In addition, through the Evergreen Project, the Authority issued the second batch of tokenized bonds and launched the \"EvergreenHub\" one-stop digital bond knowledge base and the \"Digital Bond Grant Scheme,\" continuing to drive innovation in Hong Kong's bond market. In October, the Authority announced the \"Sustainable Finance Action Plan,\" outlining specific objectives to further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to strengthen its market expansion efforts, introducing Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. In November, the Authority hosted the third edition of the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit, themed \"Navigating Through Turbulence,\" gathered financial industry leaders from around the world to share their unique insights. The summit began with an opening keynote speech by Mr. He Lifeng, Vice Premier of the State Council, followed by sessions from three mainland financial regulatory authorities and panel discussions featuring international financial leaders. Over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions participated, fully demonstrating the support and confidence of the international financial community in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority also held various other seminars and meetings, including:\n\nCo-hosted a Joint Climate Finance Conference with the Dubai Financial Services Authority in September; co-hosted the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Global Association of Risk Management Professionals in October; also co-hosted an International Financial Seminar with the Bank for International Settlements in October; and hosted a Financial Stability Board plenary meeting in December, which was the first such meeting held in Asia since 2016, gathering leaders and senior officials from over 50 national financial authorities and 12 international standard-setting bodies.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also actively strengthened bilateral ties with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the UAE Central Bank and the Saudi Central Bank to promote investment and financial market links between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed a memorandum of understanding with the UAE Central Bank to establish the interconnection of debt capital market infrastructure between the two regions, promoting cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar in October to strengthen cooperation in the financial services sector between the two regions.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held the seventh Hong Kong-Swiss Financial Cooperation Dialogue in December, with discussions covering regional and local prospects and policy challenges, as well as recent developments and potential areas for cooperation in sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority visited Thailand and Malaysia in January and May respectively, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and enterprises to promote Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and further strengthen bilateral financial ties and cooperation. One of the key areas of focus was promoting the use of the RMB and local currencies for cross-border investments and trade settlements, as well as Hong Kong's competitive advantages.\n\nOn the international level, the HKMA actively participates in central banking affairs and continues to assume leadership roles in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Asia Regional Consultative Group under the Financial Stability Board, and also holds the position of co-chair of the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the Annual Meetings of the Governors of Major Emerging Market Economies under the Bank for International Settlements and the Peer Review Group on the Crypto-Asset Framework under the Financial Stability Board. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA has continuously held the position of chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Bankers' Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for Financial Technology Promotion, together with various banking departments, continues to implement the \"Financial Technology 2025\" strategy to promote widespread adoption of financial technology within the industry and enhance Hong Kong's status as an Asian fintech hub. The main measures implemented during the year include:\n\nFurther promote the application of fintech in five key areas by banks, including wealth technology, insurance technology, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology;\n- Advance the work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) to understand its benefits and potential application scenarios, including:\n    - Proceeding with the \"multi-central bank digital currency cross-border network\" (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments;\n    - Further studying the feasibility of issuing a \"digital Hong Kong dollar\" (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; and\n    - Commencing exploration of using CBDC to support the development of Hong Kong's tokenized market;\n- Facilitate SME lending through the \"Commercial Data Pass\";\n- Strengthen cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promote the widespread use of the fast payment system \"Zhangshu Kuai.\"\n\nThe use of \"Fast Transfer\" continued to increase in 2024, with the number of registrations and transaction volume steadily rising over the past six years. As of the end of 2024, the number of \"Fast Transfer\" registrations increased to 15.8 million, with the annual daily average number of transactions rising by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to the steady growth of personal-to-person payments and business payments, the continuous increase in using \"Fast Transfer\" to pay government bills, pay merchants, and top up electronic wallets or bank accounts for value storage is the main reason driving the sustained growth in \"Fast Transfer\" transaction volume.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority monitors six designated retail payment systems and regulates 15 licensed stored value payment tools (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance). This year, the Authority continued close collaboration with the industry, enhancing control measures and protecting consumers in response to the rising risk of fraud.\n\nFollowing a two-month public consultation completed in February, the Financial Secretary's Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority jointly published a consultation summary in July and submitted the Stablecoin Ordinance Draft to the Legislative Council for review in December. To better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and establish an appropriate regulatory framework, the HKMA also launched a stablecoin issuer \"sandbox\" and announced three participating institutions entering the sandbox in July. Meanwhile, the HKMA continued to actively engage in international organizations' work on digital assets-related issues (including stablecoins and tokenization), ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Overview of Measures to Enhance the Competitiveness of Hong Kong as an International Financial Center in 2024\n\nDeepening the connectivity of financial markets between Hong Kong and the mainland, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an offshore RMB business hub, and strengthening the links within the Greater Bay Area.\n\n- Optimize the 'Cross-border Wealth Management Connect' and 'Northbound Swap Connect'  \n- Expand the eligible collateral scope of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's RMB liquidity arrangements and the 'Northbound Swap Connect' to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks in mainland China  \n- Optimize the arrangements for primary liquidity providers  \n- Enhance the nighttime cross-border service capacity of Hong Kong's RMB real-time gross settlement system to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments  \n- Support the issuance of dim sum bonds by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government in Hong Kong  \n- Facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-border credit information sharing cooperation  \n- Implement facilitation measures for cross-border remittances related to real estate purchases in the Greater Bay Area  \n- Deepen exchanges and communication between mainland-related institutions and Hong Kong's financial sector to explore business opportunities\n\n# Strengthening Connections Across the Globe\n\nHost a series of international events: the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" the Financial Stability Council plenary meeting, and a joint seminar with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nStrengthen market expansion efforts by promoting Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders, and lay a solid foundation for cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Middle East regions\nActively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations\n\n# Enhancing Financial Platform Competitiveness\n\nThrough the Evergreen Project, promoting innovation in the bond market, including assisting the government in issuing the world's first multi-currency digital bonds, launching the one-stop digital bond knowledge database \"EvergreenHub\", and introducing the \"Digital Bond Grant Scheme\"\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2024年）\n","en":"# Reserve Management\n\nThe global financial markets performed largely well in 2024. Major economies recorded stable growth, while inflation also fell to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks gradually lowered policy interest rates, creating a favorable investment environment. For the full year of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of 218.8 billion HKD, with an investment return rate of 5.2%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the delegated authority.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Ensure capital preservation;\n(ii) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. assets;\n(iii) Ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Strive to achieve investment returns, subject to the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the foreign exchange fund.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives fully take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid USD assets to provide full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member economies to ensure the value of assets and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo more effectively manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is allocating part of the Exchange Fund's assets to more diversified asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and stocks are held in investment portfolios, while private equity and real estate investments are held in the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation for the long-term growth portfolio, along with the allocation of other asset classes, is formulated in accordance with prudent risk management principles and asset portfolio diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the Exchange Fund's investment performance assessment does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception, as its deposit rates are linked to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with interest rates determined based on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio within the Future Fund was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through the investment benchmark, which refers to the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic asset allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, actual asset allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocation is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can manage the portfolio within the allowable range of strategic deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. The internally managed portion of the investment portfolio includes global fixed-income market investments and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through various derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special asset categories. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment talents in the market to achieve sustainable returns for the Foreign Exchange Fund, allowing it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, as well as to leverage the market insights and specialized investment knowledge of the external investment managers.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses primarily vary each year due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, sound risk management becomes even more critical. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors the main categories of investment risks (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks) and has established risk management procedures to provide a robust framework for strategic planning and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, while also reducing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund. Its guiding principle is that, when ESG investments have risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to other investment projects, ESG investments will generally be given priority. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in responsible investment, please refer to the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2024 Financial Market\n\nThe global financial markets' performance was generally good in 2024.\n\nMajor stock markets experienced significant gains in 2024, with the U.S. market particularly outstanding in the first three quarters amid a generally positive economic and inflation outlook and the backdrop of the AI trend. However, in the fourth quarter, market conditions became volatile due to concerns over rising inflation and interest rates, leading to a pullback from peak levels, and investors grew more cautious. Regarding mainland China and Hong Kong stock markets, investor confidence improved somewhat as a result of a series of stimulus measures introduced by the central government in the third quarter to boost the economy and stock markets. Nevertheless, under the circumstances of still unclear real economic growth, both markets softened in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe global bond market also experienced significant fluctuations in 2024. Although major central banks generally established the direction of rate cuts, the pace and extent of rate cuts changed multiple times during the year. By the fourth quarter, markets began to focus on the U.S. fiscal policy in 2025, with U.S. Treasury yields rising sharply during the quarter, putting pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to interest rate trends and relatively strong US economic performance.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, the bond market, and the stock market in 2024.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of 218.8 billion HKD in 2024, which includes:\n\n- Bond investment income of 135.9 billion HKD;\n- Stock investment income of 909 billion HKD (of which Hong Kong stock investment income was 218 billion HKD, and investment income from other stocks was 691 billion HKD);\n- Foreign exchange valuation adjustment downward for non-HKD assets amounted to 356 billion HKD; and\n- Other investment income held by the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiary company amounted to 276 billion HKD.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation gains of 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, the total assets of the Foreign Exchange Fund reached 408.1 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of the long-term growth portfolio investments was 541.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, with private equity accounting for 434.8 billion Hong Kong dollars and real estate accounting for 106.4 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment within the long-term growth portfolio was 288.6 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset portfolios) had an investment return rate of 5.2% in 2024, with the investment portfolio returning 7.2% and the support portfolio returning 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has an annualized internal rate of return of 11.2% since the start of investments in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 displays the investment return rates of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment return rates for different time periods. The Exchange Fund's average return rates were 2.0% from 2022 to 2024, 3.1% from 2020 to 2024, 3.1% from 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% since 1994.

關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2024年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及37.1。\n\n於2024年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共 39,151.17 億港元，金融負債共 13,862.99 億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n#

Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nReport by the Audit Office Director\nForeign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Director of the Audit Office Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit and Measurement Bureau\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n#Opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), listed on pages 209 to 309, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2024, the statement of income and expenses, comprehensive income statement, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement for the year ended on that date, and the notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policy disclosures.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have fairly and adequately reflected, as of December 31, 2024, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group, as well as their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. The responsibilities I have in relation to the audit of the financial statements are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I have been independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are based on my professional judgment as the most significant matters in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. I addressed these matters during the audit and formation of my opinion on the entire financial statements, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to footnotes 2.5, 2.6, and 37.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group's financial assets accounted for at fair value totaled 39,151.17 billion HKD, and financial liabilities totaled 13,862.99 billion HKD.\n\n86% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities have fair values based on quotes from active markets (Level 1 parameters) or estimated using valuation methods with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 14% of such financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with the parameters used not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets total 5,522.51 billion HK dollars, primarily comprising non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the need for estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nRegarding the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures.\n\nEvaluation and testing monitoring measures, including monitoring measures for related applications on computer systems;\n\nObtain confirmation on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\nIf market quotations are used, verify the price based on independent sources.\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources.\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the financial statements' notes 2.11, 17, and 18.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 21.132 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also holds interests in joint ventures and jointly controlled entities, whose main business is holding overseas investment properties. Regardless of whether the investment properties are held directly by the Group or through joint ventures or jointly controlled entities, their fair values are primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by joint ventures or co-operative companies, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports.\n\nEvaluate the independence and qualifications of the appraiser; and\n\nEvaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, as well as whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner must be responsible for other data. Other data includes all data in the 2024 Annual Report of the Financial Management Bureau, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I do not provide any form of attestation conclusion on other data.\n\nIn relation to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information contains material inconsistencies with the financial statements or with matters known to me during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report the matter. In this regard, I have made no report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer and the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and implementing the internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Commissioner must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue operations, as well as disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and using the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe audit committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material misstatements if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the process of conducting audits in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, fabrication, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to errors.\n\nUnderstand the internal controls related to auditing in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;\n\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, as well as whether the accounting estimates and related information disclosure are reasonable.\n\nDetermine whether the financial management commissioner's use of the going concern basis is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are significant uncertainties related to the event or situation that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that significant uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation format, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosure information, as well as whether the financial statements fairly present transactions and events; and\n\nPlan and perform group audits to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business units within the group, forming the basis for the opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and reviewing the audit work performed to carry out the group audit. I assume full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, major audit findings, and any significant internal control deficiencies identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee, explaining that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures where applicable.\n\nI will determine which matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee are most significant for the audit of the current financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws or regulations prohibit the disclosure of certain matters, or in extremely rare circumstances, where I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public interest generated by such disclosure, and thus decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to Financial Statements\n\n(All amounts are stated in Hong Kong dollars in millions, except where otherwise stated.)\n\n# 1 Main Business\n\nThe Financial Management Officer exercises powers conferred upon him by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as manager of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund's main functions are to defend the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system.\n\nThe fund's assets are managed in four different portfolios: the support portfolio, the investment portfolio, the long-term growth portfolio, and the strategic asset portfolio. According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority system, the assets of the support portfolio are fully aligned with the monetary base. The investment portfolio primarily invests in bonds and stock markets of OECD member countries. The long-term growth portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The strategic asset portfolio holds shares of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government purchased for strategic purposes and has been included in the fund's accounts. Information about operating segments is included in Note 31.\n"}
