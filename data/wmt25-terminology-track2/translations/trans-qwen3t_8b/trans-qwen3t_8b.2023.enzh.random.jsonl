{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對困境的韌性\n\n全球經濟成長放緩在高且持續較長時間利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的影響下，成為2023年金融市場的關鍵主題。不僅來自俄烏戰爭與中美關係緊張，亦包括中東地區爆發衝突，這些因素對市場造成重大影響。美國與歐洲三月銀行動盪，為自2008年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性銀行壓力，進一步壓抑市場情緒。主要經濟體面臨貨幣政策收緊所帶來的嚴峻現實，以及對通脹路徑與利率展望更大的不確定性。中國大陸經濟復甦步伐慢於普遍市場預期，進一步加劇不確定性。\n\n在全球金融市場的波動與難以預測成為「新常态」的背景下，香港再次證明了其知名適應能力，展現出顯著韌性。自去年香港疫情後全面復工以來，已進行多項工作以吸引人民回流至我們這座多變城市，並重新連繫他們與香港。香港金融管理局透過主辦一系列大量國際活動，例如全球財經領袖投資峰會及與國際貨幣基金組織 (BIS) 的會議，展示我們活躍的城市面貌，並幫助向世界發出信息，香港作為主要國際金融中心 (IFC)，持續開放並保持行動與創新中心的地位。有明確跡象顯示逐步復甦，這是由於入境旅遊的鼓舞人心復甦與改善私人消費所推動，亦受到具韌性勞動市場及政府推出的各種支持措施的支持。整體而言，2023年香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的負面地區回升至3.2%。\n\n香港金融管理局進入其第四十年。過去30年間，經濟與金融市場的動態經歷了劇烈變動，科技推動的進步遠超任何人最狂野的想像。過去三十年累積的寶貴經驗與智慧，使我們有信心面對未來。儘管面對宏觀經濟逆風與不確定的外部環境，香港金融管理局將繼續維護其保護貨幣及銀行體系穩定的使命，並積極推動發展機會，以鞏固這份穩定，並鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n前及現任香港特別行政區政府財政司司長及香港貨幣管理局總裁出席慶祝香港貨幣管理局三十週年聚會：（由左至右）葉志強先生、唐英年先生、曾俊明先生、陳國基先生、岳志強先生、梁永權先生、曾俊明先生、陳國基先生\n\n#

風雨同舟\n\n去年標誌著掛鈎匯率制度（LERS）40周年，該制度作為支持香港強大且穩健貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。40年來透明且有效的運作，已培養了市場對掛鈎匯率制度的信心及其可信性。全年港元維持在可兌換範圍內，港元市場運作暢順，反映市場對掛鈎匯率制度的強大信心，亦為國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者所分享及表達的信心。\n\n背後這信心的是香港金融管理局積極主動的努力，連同有效的監測。我們在該年度與關鍵利益相關者進行溝通，促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，這在波動時期尤為重要，無論是源自經濟壓力或政治不明朗因素。我們亦加強對我們貨幣體系的監測，藉使用來自交易庫的數據集，拓展來自銀行的細節數據，以及先進數據分析及人工智能，以提升我們的能力，讓我們能進行更及時且全面的分析。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 主要的穩定資料來源\n\n儘管多項挑戰包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張及充滿挑戰的信貸環境，香港的銀行體系全年維持穩定，支持強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本比率維持在21.1%，遠高於國際最低標準8%。截至2023年第四季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低標準100%。雖然分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%微升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍維持在長期歷史平均2.0%以下。此增幅主要由內地私人企業（POE）房地產開發商的敞口推動；但由於銀行多年來審慎信用風險管理，相關敞口水平普遍得到有效控制，銀行業整體資產質素維持健康。\n\n2023年最令市場參與者驚訝的事，無庸置疑是美國銀行風暴蔓延至歐洲，造成前所未見的系統性銀行壓力，自2008年全球金融危機以來尚屬首次。香港金融管理局在情況發展期間保持高度警覺，並採取一系列預防性措施，以限制任何潛在的負面影響，維持本地銀行及金融體系的信心。加上香港銀行所維持的雄厚資本及流動性緩衝，意味著本地銀行業 largely 未受風暴影響，即使全球金融市場動蕩，亦能維持韌性。在此次事件後，香港金融管理局進行全面內部檢討，以汲取經驗，並加強香港金融管理局的監管效能及靈活性，以便應對未來可能出現的銀行危機。\n\n雖然審慎的信貸風險管理至關重要，我們一直重申對銀行應謹記支持實體經濟的監管預期。隨著新型冠狀病毒疫情的經濟影響減退，銀行業界有秩序退出預核准本金償還假期計劃於2023年7月開始，香港金融管理局緊密合作銀行，確保逐步且暢順過渡至正常貸款償還，並為持續面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年較早時，認知到部分中小企業即使疫情已結束，仍面臨營運上的挑戰，香港金融管理局推出九項新措施，進一步協助它們從銀行取得融資。\n\n在銀行物業貸款背景下檢討與本地物業市場相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來的首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此次放寬提高了對大多數住宅按揭貸款以及用於物業發展及投資的融資的貸款與價值比率上限。其後於2024年初暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n香港金融管理局對金融機構的監管工作一直跟上時代步伐。近年全球詐騙情況顯著增加，我們已加強努力，透過推出一套全面措施，以對抗新型詐騙手法，保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法部門之間的資訊共享；加強對可疑交易的監控（包括執行即時詐騙監控及收緊支付卡認證措施）；授權客戶對支付卡有更多控制權；以及透過推出《反詐騙消費者保護守則》及交易前警示機制，教育客戶並提高公眾對詐騙的意識，當識別出較高風險的即時支付系統（FPS）交易時，會向用戶發出警告。\n\n鑑於創新及數位銀行產品與服務的快速增長，香港金融管理局與銀行業界合作，加強對消費者及投資者的廣泛保護，並提升銀行的運作及網絡韌性，以及其集體防禦系統性網絡事件的能力。同時，所有主要銀行已大幅加強其應對及復甦具破壞性勒索軟件攻擊的能力。香港金融管理局與業界亦推行不同消費者數據基礎建設項目，例如「信貸數據智享」試點計劃以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推動跨境信貸參考倡議，以便利企業的跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技及數位化在風險妥善管理的情況下，可帶來巨大的發展機會。藉較早的成功經驗促進合規科技的應用，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局支持下，於2023年8月載有新的金融科技推廣路綫，以推動金融機構在財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式帳本技術等五個重點範疇進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構會繼續與相關行業緊密合作，以便香港金融行業整體緊貼多變的金融科技發展，並把握其效益。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心 — 行動與創新中心\n\n2023年，我們充分走出疫情陰霾。香港不僅恢復營商，其作為世界領先國際金融中心之一的地位，更因全球投資者的回流及我們加強的全球網絡而進一步凸顯。在香港本地，我們把握香港金融管理局成立三十週年的機會，主辦一系列大型國際活動，並邀請全球金融與銀行業高層參與，以展現香港的活力，並發出明確信息：香港作為國際金融中心，仍具相關性且不可或缺，對追求增長與創新之全球投資者及金融機構而言尤為重要。尤其值得注意的是全球財務領袖投資峰會的重啟，該峰會於11月舉行，吸引逾350位國際及地區領袖來自約160間全球金融機構至本港。其他在香港舉行的高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監督委員會會議，以及兩場香港金融管理局與國際貨幣基金組織會議，這些會議為年度規模最大的央行行長及銀行監督機構聚會之一。這些活動證明全球金融業對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n對外而言，2023年亦是香港積極達出，以加強其與傳統市場，包括美國及歐洲，以及如中東等地的新目的地之間聯繫的一年。我們在這些市場中與同業監管機構及全球金融機構高層管理人員會面，向他們介紹香港及內地的機會，並力求尋找香港的新合作機會。\n\n為補充這些聯繫工作，我們積極貢獻於國際及區域組織的工作，擔任若干領導角色。在過去一年中，我接受邀請擔任國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）主要新興市場經濟國理事會會議主席，並擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席。我的同事亦擔任或聯席擔任Basel委員會、金融行動特別小組及東亞太平洋中央銀行高級別會議等多間其他重要組織的主席或聯席主席，例如。香港金融管理局在多間區域及國際組織的領導角色，肯定香港在國際央行及監管工作方面的專門知識與貢獻，以及香港作為國際金融中心的重要性。\n\n為持續發揮上述成就，我們必須定位為具前瞻性的國際金融中心，保持領先地位，以確保我們的持續競爭力。我們已識別出未來數年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢，即內地持續開放、綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將持續支持我們金融市場的發展，把握這些長期趨勢所帶來的機會，同時定位我們的金融平台，提供領先服務，以吸引更多業務來港。有關我們在綠色及可持續金融方面的詳情，讀者可參閱我們的可持續發展報告2023。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

2023年摘要\n\n# 經濟財務環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年展現正面增長，推動因素包括入境旅遊及內地需求的復甦。勞動市場繼續改善，隨着經濟復甦，而通脹繼續維持溫和。預計2024年經濟活動將進一步復甦，步伐溫和，雖然前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n香港銀行業在2023年繼續健康，受雄厚資本及流動性緩衝支持。資產質素繼續保持健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將高維持較長時間的情況下，港元於2023年大部分時間交易於匯兌範圍的弱方，其中弱方匯兌保證在2月中至5月初期間被觸發8次。港元匯兌及貨幣市場維持穩健，並繼續以暢順且有秩序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年標誌著掛鈎匯率制度40週年。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，掛鈎匯率制度已幫助香港抵禦過去四十年一系列震盪與危機，展現該制度的韌性與強健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局應對美國及歐洲三月銀行風暴，從管理後續影響至完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以強化本地銀行業，同時維持其對銀行信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於網絡威脅升級及由第三方提供的科技服務使用增加，香港金融管理局亦與銀行緊密合作，提升其運作及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行業行為準則及反詐騙消費者保護守則。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管框架，簡化高級專業投資者的銷售流程，引入提升跨境財富管理通證試點計劃，並開始監督信託業務。亦推出以「Credit Data Smart」為名的消費者信貸參考服務試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資方面的努力展現承諾應對風險為本方法下的最高威脅。為應對增加的數位詐騙，香港金融管理局透過推出即時詐騙監測強化生態系統合作，提升銀行與執法機構之間的資訊共享，加強公眾教育，並推出新的交易前警報機制以應用於快速支付系統。與此同時，透過宏觀分析試點計劃，監管科技能力已得到提升。\n\nHKMA 在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括有關資本充足性及披露的標準，並在銀行業領域作出顯著努力以加強能力建設。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推進其工作，以確保一個可信的解決機制，包括制定一個新的解決標準，有關接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施，以及完成對吸收損失能力政策標準執行情況的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第二屆全球財經領袖投資峰會及香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行高層會議順利舉行，展現全球金融業對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局緊密合作，深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場之間的互聯互通。這包括提升跨境財富管理通脹計劃、指定額外市場製造商於債券通南向交易、順利推出期貨通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台市場製造商計劃，所有措施均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，已取得顯著進展，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融以及企業財務中心等範疇。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續在「金融科技2025」策略的不同範疇取得重大進展。mBridge專案進入最小可行產品發展階段，e-HKD試點計劃第一階段已完成，商業數據交換見使用率增加，並順利對接政府資料來源。此外，新金融科技推廣藍圖已宣布，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠科技、人工智能及分布式帳本技術於銀行業。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五週年，並持續見到拓展應用及提升，包括與泰國PromptPay對接以實現跨境QR支付的新功能。在制定穩定幣發行者監管框架方面亦取得重大進展，並已載有諮詢文件以聚會對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 備用資金管理\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，交易所基金仍能取得良好投資收入達2,260億港元，標誌著投資回報率為5.5%。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其在資產多元化及負責任投資方面的努力。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，錄得年化內部收益率達11.8%。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道維持與社區及市場的活躍聯繫，以推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\ninternally, the HKMA 努力建立一個靈活應變且專業的 workforce，維持嚴格的財務紀律，並提升其數位能力以適應變化，並確保其政策及倡議的有效執行。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

工作重點 for 2024年及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和步伐復甦，依賴持續復甦的入境旅遊、公共基礎設施項目及穩健私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其是與未來美國政策利率路徑、全球增長前景及不斷升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢相關的風險。不過，香港金融體系仍處於有利位置，可抵禦不利衝擊，因其韌性及多年累積的充足緩衝。\n\n香港金融管理局極其重視保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將在面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境時保持警覺，力求迅速識別新興風險並以靈活應變的方式應對。同時，我們將尋求機會並創造政策空間，以協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在充滿挑戰的投資環境下管理貨幣發行基金時，我們將繼續謹慎投資，同時保持靈活，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融系統的穩定性與健全\n\n近年全球經濟的不明朗因素預期會持續至2024年。香港金融管理局將緊貼最新發展，謹慎應對潛在風險，以維持金融系統的韌性及穩定性為目標，確保關鍵性金融服務能持續提供，支持香港經濟的運作。\n\n# 保持警覺對潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能面臨波動，由於有關美國貨幣政策前景的不明朗因素、不斷變化地緣政治風險以及全球經濟復甦不均。2024年亦為關鍵選舉年，因多間重要選舉將於全球舉行。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場不明朗因素。然而，香港金融體系由於其韌性及多年累積的緩衝能力，處於有利位置以抵禦不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源及承諾，以維護香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續其努力，緊密監察本地及國際環境中出現的任何風險及弱點，并在必要時部署適當措施以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，探討影響香港經濟的問題，評估並應對這些問題所相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定\n\n2023年，全球各地爆發新的地緣政治緊張，而其他一些緊張關係則維持未解決，這對政治不確定性和不穩定性作出貢獻，預期將持續至2024年。高利率以經濟壓力的形式成為全球景觀的特徵，且利率在進入2024年時仍維持高水準。在銀行業內，持續朝數位化發展及執行新科技，包括人工智能，已帶來許多優勢，但也同時帶來新的運營及網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在這樣一個動盪的政治、經濟及科技環境下，香港金融管理局致力於透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行抵禦衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會繼續提升及完善銀行監管及政策框架，考慮科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 一個風險為本的監督重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將特別關注監測授權機構（AIs）的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類及撥備做法以及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦會保持與銀行及商業行業的緊密溝通，以確保授權機構能在審慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡，貫穿經濟週期。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟隨銀行落實2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不明朗因素以及增加的地緣政治緊張可能增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金融管理局將謹慎作為優先事項，並繼續更有效監管獲授權機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 跟進行動：汲取自2023年銀行風暴的經驗\n\n香港金融管理局將推行其為應對美國及歐洲2023年銀行風暴而進行的內部審查中識別出的跟進行動。這些行動將進一步加強監管有效性，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力，以防出現。這些行動包括加強AIs在銀行帳簿中利率風險的風險捕捉，考慮銀行服務持續數位化的背景，改善AIs在面對流動性壓力時的準備情況，簡化HKMA的危機管理程序，以及進一步加強跨部門及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運與科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監察AIs在達成全面符合金管局監管政策手冊（SPM）模組OR-2「運作韌性」方面的進展，並評估及比較銀行對合理干擾的容忍限額，以加強整體銀行系統的韌性。關於網絡風險方面，我們將監察AIs根據網絡韌性評估框架2.0進行一輪新的自我評估，並監察AIs執行安全的三重資料備份，以提升其在面對具破壞性的網絡攻擊時的資料復原能力。\n\n給予數位化在銀行運作中加速的步驟，香港金融管理局將保持緊密監測使用生成式人工智能及分布式分類帳科技等先進科技所產生的新興風險。我們亦會與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，運作一個靈活應變且預防性的機制以櫃台持續增長的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n2024年，為維護健全銀行體系並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局將應對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持有效執行針對高層政治人物的監管要求變更，以及支持穩定幣發行人的監管制度執行。我們亦會發行指引協助AI優化其交易監測系統，並推動負責任使用人工智能，重點放在應對高階洗錢的控制措施，透過主題工作進行。為加強生態系統對數位詐騙的應對及減低受害者損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界有關擴大銀行間資訊共享範疇的建議，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶，並根據收到的意見推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過匯集與反洗錢相關的數據，跨多間銀行全面建立Macro Analytics 3.0系統，並整合現有生態系統詐騙分析。這將提供更迅速的跨銀行應對，進一步提升我們數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，讓我們能採取更迅速且具決定性的行動，應對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局將加強對人工智能在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務方面之進行的現場檢查及非現場監察。具體而言，我們將重點放在跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）業務、數位分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，考慮最新市場發展以及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局將緊密溝通其他監管機構及銀行業界，適當地提供與投資、保險及MPF產品銷售相關的監管標準指引。尤其為支持VA行業可持續及負責任的發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保VA行業現行的監管制度強健、全面且平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將便利及監察業界執行跨境WMC的提升，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局合作，以便進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，以簡化投資產品的銷售程序，並適時整合及澄清指引，以便利業界遵守規則。除信託業務外，我們亦會開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監督由證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供保管服務的法人機構所從事的新類型13受規管活動，該活動將於2024年10月2日開始運作。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n香港金融管理局的目標是根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例 (PSSVFO)、金融市場基礎設施原則 (PFMI) 以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會 (CPMI) 發出的不同指引，推動其監管範疇內金融市場基礎設施 (FMIs) 的安全及效率。我們會繼續參與 CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI

{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

公司治理\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，香港金融管理局致力於維持高標準的公司治理，因為良好治理對於維持及保護公眾對香港金融管理局的信譽與信心至關重要，以履行其法定職責。\n\n為履行其對良好公司治理的承諾，香港金融管理局：\n- 制定一個清晰的治理架構，並具有高程度的責任；\n- 實施強健的控制措施以管理風險，並確保各層級員工行為及日常運作符合規定標準；以及\n- 奉行高透明度及保持開放的政策，並保持與利益相關者的緊密聯繫。\n\n# HKMA 和 香港特別行政區政府\n\nHKMA 是香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府的一部份，但能夠聘請員工，其條件與公務員制度不同，以便吸引具適當經驗及專門知識的人員。HKMA 的行政長官及其員工是公務員。HKMA 在其日常工作中，於相關法定權力授予或轉授予貨幣管理局的範圍內，享有高程度的自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港貨幣政策目標及貨幣體系的結構：財政司司長致貨幣管理局的信件，日期為2003年6月25日，訂明這些應為貨幣穩定，定義為由貨幣發行局安排維持的約7.80港元兌換一美元的穩健兌換價值。貨幣管理局獨立負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括釐定實現此目標的策略、工具及運作手段。貨幣管理局亦有責任維持香港貨幣體系的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財政服務及

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟財務環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年錄得正面增長，多虧入境旅遊及內地需求的復甦。勞動市場持續改善，隨着經濟復甦，而通脹維持溫和。資產市場在金融條件收緊及疲弱市場情緒的情況下維持疲弱。預期2024年經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實的活動\n\n在去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰中應對得當，香港經濟於2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。國內方面，私人消費因就業市場改善及政府推出的各種支持措施，如消費券計劃及一連串促銷活動而顯著復甦。儘管財務條件收緊，整體投資開支對去年低基數的比較錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港服務出口反彈，主要由於入境旅遊的強勁復甦。然而，其正面影響被出境旅遊的強勁復甦所抵銷，出境旅遊以服務進口計量。另一方面，貨品出口面對疲弱的外部需求，維持疲弱，拖累香港本地生產總值 (GDP) 增長。\n\n圖 1 實質 GDP 增長貢獻\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 實質 GDP 增長按支出組成（期間對期間）\n註：國內固定資本形成總額的經季節調整之季對季變動率不可用。\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n地方通貨膨脹於2023年維持溫和，因外部價格壓力逐步緩和，而國內成本壓力雖微升，但整體仍大致受控，儘管經濟復甦（圖2）1。全年而言，核心與總體通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%與2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動市場情況在2023年進一步改善，失業率於7月降至近十年低位的2.8%，其餘月份則徘徊在低水平（圖3）。勞動需求與勞動供應均有所增加，分別反映於總就業人數的上升（圖3）及勞動人口的增加。考慮到香港人力短缺的情況，政府於2023年推出了不同輸入勞工計劃及吸引人才措施。與此同時，面對緊張的勞動市場情況，名義工資及勞動收入的年同比增長率逐步朝疫情前水平上升。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況 資料來源：統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市於下半年轉趨遲滯。延續其反彈至年底2022年，恆生指數於2023年1月27日上漲至全年高位收市價22,689點。其後指數回落並進一步下跌至低水平，至12月（圖4），反映市場情緒因美國及瑞士銀行業問題於3月所導致的疲弱，以及第二-half全球經濟前景轉弱及金融條件收緊。恆生指數以17,047點收市，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 不動產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首四個月因內地及香港復常而出現反彈，但其後連同上升的利率及疲弱市場情緒而進一步回落。整體而言，2023年樓價年同比下跌6.9%，而物業交易進一步下跌4.5%至43,002單位的歷史低點。樓宇可負擔性維持壓力，儘管樓價下跌而稍有改善。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面臨壓力，辦公室、零售舖位及廠房樓價進一步回落。辦公室租金因高空置率及遠距辦公安排日益普及而持續面對壓力。另一方面，零售舖位租金因入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善而在2023年上升。\n\n圖4

經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預期將以溫和步伐繼續復甦。入境旅遊將隨着接待（能力）的持續改善及政府推動盛事的工作而進一步擴大，同時本地消費活動應由穩定的勞動市場支持。政府將推進的不同基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支持。與此同時，香港的貨品出口將可能回穩，並與預期的全球科技週期回升同步。政府預測20246年實質GDP將穩步增長2.5% –3.5%。然而，前景蒙上陰影，因多個風險及不明朗因素，包括源自美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦的步調、全球經濟增長前景，以及不斷升溫的地緣政治緊張。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n本地通脹預期將維持溫和，外部價格壓力回落，協助抵銷國內成本的向上壓力，並在經濟進一步復甦及住宅租金上升的情況下。市場共識預測2024年的 headline 通脹率為2.1%，而政府預測 headline 通脹率及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場預期將受持續經濟復甦支撐，而不同勞動輸入及人才吸引計劃將持續協助紓緩跨不同行業的人力短缺。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面臨數字挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國和歐洲三月銀行風暴引發的全球金融市場波動增加，以及內地及香港經濟復甦較預期為慢。儘管面對多個風險，香港銀行業維持健康，並持續由雄厚資本及流動性緩衝所支持。銀行業的資產質素維持健康，儘管分類貸款比率上升。銀行的盈利能力顯著改善，推動因素為淨利息收入增加。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的違約貸款比率於2023年底上升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所增加，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦從0.85%上升至1.24%（圖5）。內地相關貸款的違約貸款比率亦於2023年底上升至2.58%，較一年前的2.26%有所增加。違約貸款比率的上升主要由於對內地房地產開發商的風險敞口評級下調所致。然而，銀行撥備仍維持足夠。撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與違約貸款之比）於2023年底維持在75%。若考慮對違約貸款所持有的擔保品市場價值，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的逾期比率於2023年底維持在低水平，分別為0.08%及0.30%（圖6）。\n\n圖5

獲利能力趨勢\n\n銀行業在2023年錄得顯著的利潤增長。零售銀行的總體稅前營業利潤在該年度上升了62.1%，同時稅後資產回報率由0.57%升至0.89%（圖7）。利潤改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+30%），以及2023年交易性投資產生的顯著收益，相較於去年的溫和虧損。此部分被貸款減損費用增加（+28%）所抵銷，因特定撥備已為新分類貸款設立。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息邊際從一年前的1.31%擴大至2023年的1.68%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行的營運費用與營收比率從2022年的48.0%降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定性\n\n在2023年，面對市場預期美國政策利率將維持高水準較長時間，港元大部分時間在可兌換範圍的弱方交易，其中弱方可兌換安排在2月中至5月初間被觸發了八次。自5月起，港元重拾動力，年底時交易於7.8的中間價附近。在2023年慶祝其40周年紀念的聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息更廣泛層面跟隨美元利率，同時亦受本地供應與需求影響。整體而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場維持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對各種外部衝擊的強大與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在國際外匯市場上對美元匯率的穩定價值，以在香港外匯市場上對美元的匯率為條件，在HK$7.75至7.85兌US$1的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構採用貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由100%存放在發行基金中的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證券，提供全面支持予由三間發行紙幣的銀行發行的紙幣；\n- 政府發行的貨幣紙幣及硬幣流通中；\n- 總結餘，即設於香港金融管理局的結算賬戶結餘總和；以及\n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的貨幣基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅定履行可兌換承諾 (CUs) 的承諾而維持。當強方 (或弱方) CU 被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備應要求以 HK$7.75 (或 HK$7.85) 美元兌換港元 (或以港元兌換美元)，向銀行沽出 (或買入) 港元，總結餘將擴大 (或收窄) 以拉低 (或推高) 港元利率，協助將港元回復至 7.75 至 7.85 的可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持高檔較長時間的情況下，2023年全年港元維持疲弱，大部分時間交易在可兌換範圍的疲弱側。從2月中至5月初，弱側可兌換範圍共觸發8次。港元匯率在5月初至7月期間回升一些強勢，部分由上市公司派發紅利相關需求及企業半年結算資金需求推動。其後，港元主要由本地資金需求的變化推動，例如通過南向證券通的買盤，並在年底交易於約7.8的中間價位附近（圖1）。整體而言，港元匯市在2023年持續正常運作。\n\n圖1 外匯市場匯率 2023年\n\n二月至五月，香港金融管理局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行的要求，在疲弱方結售匯制度下買入總計515億港元。反映疲弱方結售匯制度的觸發，總結算餘額由2022年底的9630億港元減少至2023年底的4500億港元。與此同時，未償還EFBNs在全年內微升，由12,004億港元增至12,455億港元。總結算餘額與未償還EFBNs總計因此由2022年底的12,967億港元下跌至2023年底的12,904億港元（圖2）。貨幣基礎整體維持充分由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 總餘額（於貼現窗口前）及未償還交換基金紙幣於2023年\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據LERS，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）在更廣泛層面跟隨其美元有關當局。由於美國在2023年的前七個月持續上調利率，HIBORs在更廣泛層面上升（圖3）。全年而言，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n以下美國聯邦資金利率目標範圍增設後，基地利率經調整上調四次，總計上調一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上調至5.75%。在零售方面，美國政策利率上調後，多間銀行於五月初將最高貸款利率上調12.5個基點，並於年底七月再上調12.5個基點。部分銀行亦於本年內提高新核准按揭貸款的HIBOR基準貸款利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的資金市場持續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款增至2023年的388億港元，較2022年的84億港元有所增加，且相關使用率未見異常。\n\n圖3 香港銀行間拆借利率 2023年\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\nLERS已成為香港金融體系四十年來的強大支柱，並體現其強大與韌性以應對挑戰。儘管存在持續的不明朗因素，包括美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦，香港美元匯率及資金市場仍持續以有秩序的方式運作，反映LERS的強大性。政府堅決支持LERS。在其2023年外資部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，LERS的可信性已透過透明的設立規則、大量財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續運作暢順，流動性狀況及資本充足率表現良好，符合國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將發行基金資產的特定部分配置用以支持貨幣基礎。後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）自2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超越了上觸發水平112.5%（圖4）。這 largely 反映了因本年首半年啟動疲弱側CU所導致的總結餘收縮。根據發行基金顧問委員會核准的安排，並因債務證券贖回，資產已從後備組合轉移至投資組合，以將後備比率減低至2023年5月8日約109.97%。其後，後備比率穩步上升，於12月31日收市於110.73%。根據LERS，雖然特定發行基金資產已被指定用於後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。發行基金充足的財政資源，加上健康的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的支持。\n\n圖4：2023年每日支持比率變動\n\n# 貨幣委員會分委員會\n\n香港金融管理局發行基金顧問委員會的貨幣發行局子委員會（CBC）監察並審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2023年，CBC考慮了包括5月2022年穩定幣市場崩盤、聯邦儲備銀行的美元流動性後盾措施傳輸至香港銀行，以及近期港元利率變動等問題。CBC就這些問題的討論記錄及提交給CBC的貨幣發行局運作報告，載有於香港金融管理局網站上。\n\n#

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2023年儘管面對多個挑戰，包括美國和歐洲三月的銀行風暴、高利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍維持強大且具韌性。香港金融管理局迅速回應三月銀行風暴，從管理後續影響到完成內部審查（涵蓋監管程序及解決框架等範疇），汲取經驗以提升本地銀行業的韌性，同時維持對持牌機構信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續升級，以及多個第三方提供的科技服務使用量增加，香港金融管理局亦緊密合作持牌機構，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡方面的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行行為守則以及推出反詐騙消費者保護憲章。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管框架，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，推出提升跨境財富管理通諭試行計劃，並開始監管信託業務。為準備提供「信貸數據智控」下的消費者信貸參考服務，推出試行計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力展現了承諾，以風險為本的方法應對最高風險。為應對日益增加的數位詐騙，香港金融管理局透過推出實時詐騙監測系統及擴展公私合作資訊共享的範疇，加強生態系統合作，包括詐騙及洗錢情報工作組。推出突破性的平台以便利銀行間資訊共享，將有助處理詐騙帳戶網絡的風險，同時香港金融管理局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理與詐騙相關的銀行投訴，並提升公眾對不同詐騙手法的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統時的交易前警報機制。與此同時，監管科技能力亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃有所提升。\n\n良好進展已取得於本地實施國際監管標準，包括資本充足率及披露相關標準。亦取得顯著努力於加強銀行業能力建設，吸引及培育未來人才，並提升現有從業人員技能。此外，香港存款保障局已完成關於擬議提升存款保障計劃的公開諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動其工作以確保可信的解決機制。制定與接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準，並完成對實施吸收損失能力政策標準經驗的檢視。在與銀行進行解決計劃時，針對解決過程中的早期終止風險及運作連續性取得重大進展。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作以推動解決事宜。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的普遍目標是推動銀行系統的安全與穩定。達成此目標依賴於一個具極高韌性的金融體系，該體系有能力提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其執行業務的方式，可能影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，甚至可能以失序方式失敗。貨幣管理局作為監管機構，扮演關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備對衝擊的韌性，並能在危機中恢復其狀況，最終協助防止失敗。貨幣管理局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反地，作為解決機構，貨幣管理局旨在確保若AI不可持續經營，其倒閉可有秩序地處理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為AI及其他類別機構的解決機構。為落實香港的解決機制，制定解決規則及政策標準、進行解決計劃以消除對AI可解決性的阻礙，並發展貨幣管理局處理失敗AI的運作能力至關重要。為更有效執行這些工作，貨幣管理局採用國際協調的統一方式。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。在香港金融管理局監察FMIs時，旨在推動其普遍安全與效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。使FMIs更具韌性以應對金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融體系免受源自FMIs中斷的可能動搖影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n在本年期間，香港金融管理局向兩家註冊於香港以外的銀行授予一個銀行牌照及一個受限銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦向4項外國交易平臺營運商授予買賣證批准，並撤銷另一項授予一名買賣證持有人的批准。香港金融管理局在本年期間撤銷五間受牌照銀行的牌照。\n\n更多有關AIs及香港本地代表機構的資訊，可於附錄及第D至F表於頁313至316及頁322至325分別查閱。\n\n# 審閱三層銀行體系\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了一項全面檢討三層銀行體系，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。檢討結果查閱三層體系已變得比必要更複雜，以便取得原來的目標，即在進入銀行體系的靈活性與保護小型存款人之間取得平衡。其後，香港金融管理局於6月開始進行三個月的諮詢，就簡化三層銀行體系為兩層的提案，將存款公司合併至受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第2屆層級。回應者對此提案更廣泛層面支持。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛種類的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理及風險管理。作為香港金融管理局持續推動更強風險治理努力的一部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、授權機構及其外部核數師之間亦舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了離場活動外，香港金融管理局亦定期進行現場審查，覆蓋AI機構的各類活動。在高利率環境及部分內地房地產開發商債務違約的情況下，信貸風險管理成為重點，因當前信貸風險環境充滿挑戰。由於AI機構應用科技的趨勢進一步加速，運營風險及科技風險管理亦成為另一重點。香港金融管理局亦加強對氣候風險管理的監管工作，推出一輪聚焦氣候相關風險管理的主題審查，以及一連串諮詢會議，以提供監管指引予AI機構。\n\n美國及歐洲於2023年3月開始的銀行動盪，是自2008年重大金融危機以來在規模和範圍方面最重大的系統性銀行壓力。隨著動盪發展，香港金融管理局保持高戒備，並接任一系列預防性行動，以確保任何潛在後果不會削弱本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件後，香港金融管理局進行了一項內部檢討練習，顧及從動盪中獲得的觀察及經驗。基於此項練習，香港金融管理局制定了一項詳細行動計劃，納入所學經驗，以加強其監管效能，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力，以防萬一。詳情請參見第95頁的流動性及市場風險部分，了解香港金融管理局在此方面的相關工作。\n\n在進行監督方面，香港金融管理局於證券、投資產品、保險及與強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關的業務以及消費者保護事項進行現場檢查，並針對評估為較高風險或新舉措的範疇進行主題性審查。\n\n表1 載有 HKMA 監管活動於2023年的概要。\n\n表 1 監督活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n總貸款在2023年減少3.6%，相比2022年的3.0%下跌。表2列明貸款及推進的增長分解。與內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及推進的增長\n\n表3 與大陸相關的貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地房地產市場持續疲弱的情況下，加強監管努力，監測AI的資產質量並評估其信貸風險管理實踐。銀行業的資產質量在該年度惡化，但維持可控制。銀行業的分類貸款比率在2023年底為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在年度內，香港金融管理局進行針對性及主題性審查，以評估人工智能機構的信貸風險管理，聚焦於對易受影響行業的敞口、保險 premiums 融資、監督在香港以外地區業務中的信貸風險及對非銀行金融機構的敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於七月宣布開始有序退出預核准本金支付假期計劃。該計劃於2020年五月推出，以協助符合資格的企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業行業的意見，已提升部分本金償還選擇，以協助企業逐步恢復正常償還。若行業或個別借款人即使在疫情結束後仍面臨挑戰，銀行持續提供本金寬限期或其他適合的信貸緩解措施，個案為基礎。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在接待（能力）未參與計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業的資金需求時，表現同理心。香港金融管理局提醒銀行在交易遇到償還問題的企業時，應遵循「香港企業困難處理指引」，以確保貸款人共同利益，並促進銀行間的協作。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局推出連續數輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理及銀行業界應對物業價格急跌所引發挑戰的能力。2023年核准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率（LTV）維持在57%，相比2009年9月在逆周期措施首次推出前的64%（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款平均供款與入息比率（DSR）維持在低水平40%，相比2010年8月首次對DSR設限時的41%。\n\n7月7日，香港金融管理局鑑於考慮到物業價格、交易量及本地及國際經濟環境等因素，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出以來首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。調整內容包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款與價值比率，以及以抵押貸款申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率。此外，取消了對收入主要來自香港以外地方的按揭貸款申請人，降低適用的最高貸款與價值比率及供款與入息比率限額十個百分點的規定。香港金融管理局亦取消了當抵押貸款申請人的總按揭融資超出香港金融管理局正常可接受的貸款與價值比率上限20個百分點時，需對適用的供款與入息比率限額減去五個百分點的規定。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局採用多管齊下策略，以取得顯著進展，鞏固香港作為具有全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n兩項重大活動的成功，即全球財務領袖投資峰會及 HKMA-BIS 高層次會議，強化了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生正面漣漪效應。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局作出努力，以深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。此刊載於廣東廣州灣地區跨境財富管理連通計劃的提升，指定額外做市商於債券通南向交易，順利推出期貨通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市計劃。這些舉措有效加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的門戶地位及地位。\n\n香港金融管理局亦在債券發行、資產及财富管理、綠色及可持續金融以及企業財務中心等範疇取得良好進展，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港金融服務，香港金融管理局加強市場拓展活動，針對海外及內地相關方，保持他們對香港金融市場及其實力的了解。\n\n已取得重大進展，HKMA的「Fintech 2025」戰略在所有範疇均有推進，包括在推動金融科技應用、央行數字貨幣、數據基礎設施、人才培育以及政策與資金支持等範疇內。\n\nFPS 五周年慶祝活動於九月舉行。註冊數字穩步增長，並在2023年底達到13.6百萬。該系統全年平均每日成交額上升至1.25百萬筆即時交易。香港與泰國之間的跨境QR支付FPS x PromptPay 連結於12月與泰國銀行聯合推出，為兩地之間旅行人士提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及地區性貨幣當局及監管組織的活躍成員，香港金融管理局持續貢獻於全球努力，以維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展。\n\n# 概覽\n\n貫穿全年，香港金融管理局持續制定積極努力以加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。11月，其舉辦了第二屆全球財務領袖投資峰會。此三日活動聚集來自世界各地的知名財務領袖，在「與複雜共存」主題下分享他們獨特的視野。逾350名參加者來自160間國際金融機構參與，峰會清楚顯示全球金融業對香港的承諾及信心。當月，香港金融管理局與國際貨幣基金組織（BIS）共同主辦HKMA-BIS高層會議，吸引逾3,000億名參加者，包括逾20名現任及前央行總裁。會議凸顯香港金融管理局與BIS的緊密合作，以及與國際央行界的合作。\n\n內地與香港通關計劃的擴展及對其作出的提升，已加強香港作為內地與國際金融市場橋樑的角色。為便利跨境零售投資於廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA），一連串針對跨境財富管理通關計劃（跨境WMC）的提升措施已推出。借助南向債券通關計劃暢順運作，香港金融管理局指定9名額外做市商，以改善二級流動性並符合投資者需求。今年成功推出北向交易的期貨通關計劃，讓全球投資者透過香港更好地管理其內地固定收益投資組合所相關的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務在該年期間見證強勁增長。香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所及清算所有限公司（HKEX）合作，於6月推出 HKD-RMB 雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台市場製造計劃。這有助於在香港發展更多元化種類的人民幣等值產品，並促進在香港發行及交易人民幣等值股票。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其為提升香港作為優先資管中心的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新方面亦取得重大進展，並鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。同時，香港金融管理局加強市場拓展活動，推動香港金融服務向海外及內地利益相關者推廣。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融科技（金融科技）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。本年度推行的主要措施包括：\n- 推動財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術等科技重點範疇的進一步應用；\n- 推進 Wholesale 中央銀行數字貨幣 (CBDC) 的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 進一步推進在香港推出零售 CBDC（即 e-HKD）的前景研究；\n- 加強努力發展商業資料交換 (CDI)；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 透過資金及政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 拓寬 FPS 的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全且高效運作對維持該城市作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，四項銀行間實時總額結算（RTGS）系統、中央結算系統（CMU）及香港交易結算所（HKTR）實現了100%系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括債券通對接服務，持續暢順運作。\n\nFPS的應用持續增加，標誌著FPS達成五周年重大里程碑。FPS的註冊數字及成交額在過去五年的持續增長，註冊數字在2023年底增至13.6百萬，且全年平均每日成交額較2022年上升33%。FPS用於處理政府帳單、進行商戶付款及增值儲值卡（SVF）電子錢包或銀行賬戶的使用上升，成為交易量持續上升的關鍵驅動因素，並在個人對個人及商業付款持續增長的基礎上。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局監督六項指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（PSSVFO）監督17間持牌儲值支付工具發行機構（SVFs），其中4項為由持牌銀行發行的SVFs。本年度，香港金融管理局亦持續便利暢順執行政府消費券計劃，協助協調有關計劃的相關政府第三方及指定發行機構，並促進其間的對話與合作。\n\n於27（1月27日）12月，財政及庫務局與香港金融管理局聯合發佈有關穩定幣發行人的監管公開諮詢文件。香港金融管理局其後於2024年3月12日推出沙盒安排，為在香港計劃發行法幣參考穩定幣的機構。同時，香港金融管理局積極參與國際機構在加密資產活動方面的相關工作，並緊密監測市場發展。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局（HKMA）維持為中央銀行界別的積極成員，並持續在數個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導角色。現正，HKMA共同擔任巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）政策與標準小組主席，以及亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監測專家小組（至6月）及金融穩定委員會（FSB）金融創新網絡主席。HKMA亦擔任國際貨幣基金組織（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體央行總裁會議主席。2018年至2023年間，HKMA連續條件擔任東亞太平洋央行高級別會議（EMEAP）下設金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局亦分別於五月及七月與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及沙特阿拉伯國家銀行舉行雙邊會議，以推動中東與亞洲之間的投資及金融市場聯通。第六屆香港－瑞士金融對話於9月25日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論涵蓋區域及國內展望與政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技及市場聯通等範疇的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

備用資金管理\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。雖然主要發達經濟體的通脹水平自2023年高峰下跌，但仍維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在經歷進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能已達或接近頂峰。這與具韌性的美國經濟相輔相成，使投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄烏戰爭及本年中東地區衝突爆發，為投資市場增添了波動與不明朗因素。在這複雜多變的投資環境中，交易所基金的投資表現出現了一些起伏。儘管如此，交易所基金成功取得良好的投資回報。2023年，交易所基金錄得投資收入2,260億港元，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n證券交易所基金的主要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所制定，是影響香港貨幣的交換價值，無論是直接或間接的方式。該基金亦可能用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以便協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司所轉授的權限範圍內，負責向財政司報告證券交易所基金的使用及投資管理事宜。\n\n# 交換基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已設立以下投資目標為證券交易所基金：\n\n(i) 保障資本；(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候均充分由流通性高且以美元計值的資產支持；(iii) 確保為維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的，足夠的流動性可用；及(iv) 受(i)–(iii)限制，取得一項投資回報，以協助保障發行基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標採取全面考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並被註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 交易所基金投資組合分離\n\n廣義而言，發行基金擁有兩大資產組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有流通性高之美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，提供全面支持予貨幣基礎。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體之債券及股權市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力為目標。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局以審慎且循序漸進的方式，將發行基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私人股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別一起釐定，受審慎風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略的限制。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年建立，持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，該股份由政府為交易所基金帳戶購入，用作戰略目的。由於其獨特的性質，戰略投資組合未納入基金投資表現評估。\n\n# 投資與發行局\n\n交易所基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的 placements。利率更廣泛層面掛鈎於投資組合1的表現。重大個別例子是未來基金2，其利率掛鈎於投資組合及長期政府債券的回報，根據組合配置比例。未來基金2在2023年投資組合及長期政府債券之間的組合配置比例約為35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程支持於兩種資產配置類別的決策：戰略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映於投資指標，代表基於交易所基金投資目標的長期資產配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會戰略性配置以爭取超越投資指標的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與投資指標（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與投資指標配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏差」。雖然投資指標及循跡誤差3限額由財政司司長與EFAC磋商後釐定，但戰略性決定及戰略性偏差的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權限下取得及設立。在戰略性偏差的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可取得不同狀況以爭取短期市場變動的優勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局發行基金投資辦事處專責發行基金的投資及相關風險管理功能。發行基金投資辦事處的成員直接管理約71%的發行基金投資，包括整體BP及部分IP。由內部管理的IP部分包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的組合，以及不同衍生工具對沖組合，實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除內部管理資產外，亦僱用外部基金管理人管理發行基金約29%的資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專門資產類別。聘請外部基金管理人的目的，在於汲取市場上可用的最高投資專門知識，以獲取可持續回報，同時亦汲取多元化且互補的投資方式，並利用外部市場見解及投資領域的專門知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理及保管費、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅費。該支出主要由市場因素釐定，且可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好風險管理日益重要。香港金融管理局設定嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，適用於其內部及對外管理的投資組合，並確保已制定妥善的風險監察及合規系統。為推行有效的風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設立三道防線。關鍵風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及操作風險）定期監察。風險管理程序規定一個強固的框架，以支持香港金融管理局的戰略規劃及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局相信，適當強調負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，可協助取得交易所基金的投資目標，以及減低其基礎投資相關環境、社會及治理（ESG）事項的風險。為積極支持負責任投資實踐，香港金融管理局已將ESG因素併入交易所基金的投資過程，其指導性原則為：若ESG投資的長期風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，則會更廣泛層面優先考慮ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關香港金融管理局負責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱《可持續發展報告2023》的負責任投資章節。\n\n# 交換基金的表現\n\n# 2023年的金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年更廣泛層面呈現向上趨勢。標普500指數全年上升24%。尤其是在第四季，市場開始預期比預期更快的減息。\n\n在債券市場上，收益率維持高檔，其中10年期美國國債收益率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨着市場對央行貨幣政策預期的改變，債券收益率在年底回落，並伴隨債券價格逐步上升。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元對主要貨幣錄得不一表現。其中，英鎊與歐元對美元升值，而日圓與人民幣貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現體現在表1中。\n\n表1 2023年市場回報\n\n# 備用資金管理\n\n#

The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

YouTube），這些渠道統稱共有超過150,000名跟隨者。香港金融管理局的主要峰會及研討會，包括全球財經領袖投資峰會，均會透過其社交媒體渠道進行直播，以提升公眾及業界參與度。香港金融管理局亦開發創意社交媒體內容，以提升公眾對多種主題及計劃的意識。近期內容涵蓋主題如消費者保護及詐騙預防、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及香港金融管理局的重大活動。\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n香港金融管理局的公眾查詢服務規定一個有效的渠道，為公眾展望以更好地了解關鍵的香港金融管理局功能和運作。\n\n2023年，公眾查詢服務共處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約有一半的查詢與消費者銀行業務問題、銀行政策及規範、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣及硬幣相關。一些常見的查詢主題則有關銀行產品及服務、硬幣收藏計劃、零售債券發行計劃、銀行相關指引及通函，以及快速支付系統。\n\n圖1 列明自2020年起由公共查詢服務收到的公共查詢的數字，以及圖2 規定有關2023年收到的查詢的性質的詳細分類。\n\n圖1 總數字公眾查詢\n\n圖2 2023年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 著作\n\n於該年度期間，HKMA

公司網站\n\n香港金融管理局的官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），載有近六成萬頁以英文及傳統及簡體中文書寫的內容，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。該網站載有根據《銀行條例》（BO）第20章維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券從業員登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值憑證條例》維持的儲值憑證牌照發牌機構登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自 2018 年起分階段透過 Open API 發佈財務數據及重要資訊。至 2023 年底，香港金融管理局已開放 175 組 Open APIs，符合其目標進度。\n\n香港金融管理局的開放API入口網站：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於兩國際金融中心55樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心，由展覽館及圖書館組成，旨在向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識。互動展覽館提供香港金融管理局工作的概述，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，連同對研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務有幫助的資訊和展品。\n\n在這一年期間，資訊中心歡迎超過31,000名訪客，並為學校及其他小組舉辦超過480場以…為指引的導覽。\n\n圖書館，下一步展覽館範圍，專責超過26,000本書、期刊及其他出版物於香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行題目。它亦維持AIs及本地代表辦事處的登記，以及AIs證券人員的登記，以供公眾使用，如BO第20章所要求。\n\n年輕的訪客在香港資訊中心的導賞活動中學習紙幣的設計。\n\n為幼稚園學生提供的資訊中心導賞\n\n# 社區聯繫與公共教育\n\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局一直推行一個公共教育計劃，向社區推廣，以提升公眾對其工作的意識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與該公共教育計劃。2023年，為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。該研討會主題刊載於香港金融管理局工作的概述、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融，以及銀行業的事業機會。\n\n香港金融管理局教育並參與公眾，使其成為聰明且負責任的金融消費者。鑑於釣魚詐騙及信用卡詐騙案件上升，香港金融管理局持續其努力，透過跨不同媒體提醒公眾保持警覺。繼推出反詐騙消費者保護守則後，香港金融管理局推出全新意識宣傳活動，強調銀行及主要商戶承諾不會透過即時電子訊息發送要求個人及信用卡資料的超連結。香港金融管理局亦透過電台及社交媒體渠道傳達有關信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同付款選項（包括「現購後付」產品）的聰明提示。\n\n以主題「保障您的個人數位鎖匙；提防詐欺連結！」製作，包含食人植物與動物陷阱的短片及動畫\n\n跨媒體宣傳被製作出來，提醒公眾成員不要點擊可疑連結。\n\n動畫短片以推動e-laisees\n\n為支持環境保護，並汲取金融服務領域的科技推進，香港金融管理局鼓勵公眾成員透過社交媒體及電台宣傳活動發放電子劵 (e-劵)，並考慮在中國新年期間使用良好如新的紙幣作為實體劵。\n\n香港金融管理局亦旨在提升公眾對金融業的了解，並上調年輕人對修讀該行業事業的興趣，從而擴大香港金融業的人才庫。繼其較早推出的短片系列「中央地區人才四面體」獲得正面回饋後，香港金融管理局推出名為「金融特種部隊：開拓新視野」的新短片系列，該系列短片聚焦金融業的四項成長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。該短片系列利用電腦圖形及動畫，展示資深市場實務人員監管年輕人才在他們管理日常工作的挑戰，提供鑑於聯繫推出事業機會與前景內的行業。\n\n一連串短片「Financial

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 獨立會計師報告 致財政司\n\n# 意見\n\n本人認證，本人已審核交換基金及其子公司（「該小組」）列於第211至311頁之財務報表，包括交換基金及該小組於2023年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出賬目、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，財務報表提供真實且公允的視圖，關於基金及小組截至2023年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流，根據香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）由香港特許會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈，並已妥善編製，根據行政長官根據《證券及期貨條例》（第66章）第7章所取得的指令。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據財政司司長根據《發行基金條例》第7章所制定的指示及審計委員會審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我的責任在報告中「審計財務報表部分的審計師責任」一節有進一步說明。我根據這些準則與集團無關，並已根據這些準則履行了我的其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，在審計截至2023年12月31日的財務報表過程中最具重要性的事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表全年過程中及形成我的意見時解決，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包含所有刊載於香港貨幣管理局2023年年度報告中的資訊，除外財務報表及我的會計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證舉行。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則看起來有重大錯誤。若基於我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有義務報告此事實。我在此方面無需報告任何事項。\n\n# 貨幣當局及發行基金顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則及根據發行基金條例第7章所取得的行政長官指令，準備財務報表，以提供真實且公允的視圖，並為貨幣管理局認為必要的內部控制，以使財務報表免費免於重大錯誤，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局有責任評估小組持續經營的能力，揭露與持續經營相關的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監察小組的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表全年無重大錯誤，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高層次的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總是能發現存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能出現於詐欺或錯誤，若個別或總體而言，它們可能被合理預期會影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計的一部分，我貫穿整個審計過程行使專業判斷並維持專業懷疑態度。我也：\n\n識別並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能偵測出因詐欺所致的重大誤報的風險，高於因錯誤所致的重大誤報的風險，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內控；  \n取得有關審計的內控相關了解，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非為表達對集團內控有效性意見之目的；  \n評估所運用會計政策的適當性及會計估計與相關揭露的合理性；  \n結論為集團財務機構使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性，並基於取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計報告中引起對財務報表中相關揭露的注意，或若這些揭露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團停止持續經營；  \n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構與內容，包括揭露，以及財務報表是否以達成公允呈現的方式反映基礎交易與事件；以及  \n取得有關集團內實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當審計證據，以表達對財務報表的意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督與執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會溝通，有關其他事項之中，包括預計的審計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內控缺陷。\n\n我亦提供交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組一份聲明，說明我已遵守相關倫理要求有關獨立性，並與他們溝通所有可能被認為與我的獨立性有關的關係及其他事項，適用時的相關保障措施。\n\n根據與發行基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會聯繫的事項，我確定在當前期間財務報表審計中最重要的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法例或規則禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極少見的情況下，我認為不應在報告中披露某項事項，因披露該事項的不利後果，合理預期將超過該披露對公共利益的效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n林志源奈森教授 稽核總監\n\n# 1. 主要業務\n\n金管局根據財政司轉授的權限，作為發行基金的主管（該基金簡稱「基金」），根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。基金的主要工作是保護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全。\n\n基金資產以四項投資組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合資產充分匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及不動產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府為基金戰略目的購入。運作部門資訊詳見附註31。\n\n# 二 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該準則為一個集合期，包括所有適用的個別 HKFRSs、香港會計準則及由香港特許會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及在香港更廣泛層面接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（以下統稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策設立於下文。\n\n香港會計師公會已發佈若干新修訂後的 HKFRSs，這些標準首次生效或可供早期採用，適用於集團當前會計期間。第三節提供有關因初步應用這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資訊，凡與集團在這些財務報表中所反映的當前及前會計期間相關者。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n小組財務報表包括小組的財務報表以及小組在合營企業及聯營公司的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務體現在第16及17號附註中。\n\n編製財務報表時所採用的測量基礎為歷史成本，除非以下資產及負債以公允價值計量：\n- 金融衍生工具（參考附註2.6）；\n- 以收入支出帳戶計量之金融資產及金融負債（參考附註2.6）；\n- 以其他綜合收益計量之金融資產（參考附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（參考附註2.10）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（參考附註2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製財務報表，需要管理層作出影響政策申請及資產、負債、收入及支出報告金額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是基於歷史經驗及不同其他因素，這些因素在情況下被認為是合理的，其結果作為作出有關資產及負債攜帶價值判斷的基礎，而這些價值不易從其他來源顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。會計估計的修訂若僅影響該期間，則應在該期間確認；若修訂同時影響當前及未來期間，則應在修訂期間及未來期間確認。\n\n管理層在申請HKFRSs時所取得的判斷，這些判斷對財務報表有重大生效，且為估計不確定性資料來源，於附註2.18中披露。\n\n若干比較數字已重新表述，以符合小組財務報表當年頒獎典禮的呈現。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是小組控制的實體。當小組因參與該實體而曝露於變動報酬，或擁有該報酬之權利，且有能力透過對該實體的控制權影響這些報酬時，即控制該實體。在評估小組是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮由小組及第三方持有的實質性權利。\n"}
