{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 首席執行長聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟實現穩步增長；通脹維持在低水平；美國聯邦儲備系統全年進行三次利率上調並實施縮表政策，並未導致新興市場經濟體出現資本外流或美元走強。在看漲情緒推動下，全球股市持續創下新高，包括三大美國股市指數均不斷刷新歷史高點。MSCI新興市場指數飆升34%。恆生指數在2017年漲近8,000點（或36%），並在2018年1月突破30,000點關卡，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境下充滿樂觀情緒，甚至興奮不已。然而，這一切直到今年年初二月，最新數據顯示美國工資上漲幅度高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市的重大修正。二月第二週的兩天內，道瓊斯指數下跌超過1,000點，恆生指數在同一週下跌超過3,000點。10年期美國國債收益率激增至2.95%。資金流動的快速反轉顯示，市場估值創新高並非建立在穩固基礎之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個健全且穩健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動及資本外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n#銀行體系韌性提升因預防性措施\n\n有句話說：「防患未然」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩釋措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆周期措施，並加強銀行對物業發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系對物業市場下行風險的抗風險能力。透過多輪措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率已由2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%，而平均還款比率亦由2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被視為「太大而不能倒」的無法持續經營的金融機構。這有助於防止類似2008年全球金融危機的重演，當時政府動用公帑拯救即將倒閉的金融機構，並可減輕這些機構關閉對金融體系、經濟以及整個社會所造成的影響。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩健可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，並位居世界最高水平之一。這無疑體現了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。確實，2017年銀行業實現強勁增長，總貸款額增長16%，同時資產質量亦保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年起的長期平均值2.2%。2017年銀行業總體資本回報率（以稅前營運利潤計算）達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心，屬於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行業是長期財務穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露出僅依賴規則和法規來限制金融業追求盈利而無視其主要責任的局限性。基於此，香港金融管理局近年積極推動「健全銀行業」實踐，鼓勵銀行發展並追求良好的企業文化及價值觀。特別是為解決銀行員工為追求短期利潤而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們正鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化及價值觀相符的適當激勵制度。作為此項行動的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦了首屆年度獨立非執行董事會議，以強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並賦予獨立非執行董事更有效的監督與監察職能。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，香港金融管理局於2017年在推動金融包容方面取得成功。六間實體銀行分行及三間移動銀行分行已在偏遠地區開始運作。香港銀行協會與EPS及一家便利商店連鎖店合作，推出了一項試點計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的商店內無需購物即可提領現金。香港郵政今年亦於七間主要位於離島及新界地區的郵政局推出為長者提供現金提領服務。有關開戶事宜，香港金融管理局去年設立了網頁及電郵帳號，並設有專責團隊跟進與開戶相關的公眾查詢或投訴。由於各相關持份者協同努力，個人及企業銀行戶口開戶的客戶體驗已出現顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技顛覆銀行業規則\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須積極採納新發展，推動創新應用金融科技。隨著智能銀行新時代的來臨，香港金融管理局於九月推出了七項舉措（詳見第106頁）以促進銀行業對金融科技的採用，從而提升銀行產品及服務的質素，以更好地服務客戶。雖然這些舉措彼此獨立，但卻相輔相成，將為香港未來的支付及銀行服務格局帶來重大轉折。客戶不僅能享受更便捷、高效及安全的支付及銀行服務，亦將擁有更多選擇及對自身財務交易更大的控制權。金融科技將成為銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，而邁入智能銀行新時代，將為銀行提供升級轉型的絕佳機會。\n\n# 一帶一路與粵港澳大灣區建設所創造的巨大機遇\n\n國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，香港擁有多元化的金融產業至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。考慮到香港獨特的優勢——「以內地為腹地，同時保持國際視野」，一帶一路倡議及廣東港澳大灣區的發展將為金融和銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。為回應一帶一路倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自成立以來合作夥伴數量已增至約90家，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻一帶一路債券，凸顯香港在這些基礎設施項目融資中所扮演的關鍵角色。\n\n除基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業資金管理中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生產品業務樞紐的發展，透過吸引 multinational corporations 及主要金融機構於本港管理其資金、資產及各種財務風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務行業。香港金融管理局亦保持與負責灣區發展的相關部門密切溝通，以加強合作，推動該地區作為世界級城市群的財務發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直以「善用香港優勢，響應國家需求」為主題持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年啟動深港通，以及去年七月啟動債券通北向交易以來，透過香港金融平台，內地與世界其他地區的雙向市場准入已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這凸顯香港作為金融中介的獨特角色，促進全球投資者接觸內地金融市場。2017年，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務主要中心的地位，人民幣實時全额結算系統的平均每日成交額達人民幣9千億元。此外，根據SWIFT統計數據，全年全球人民幣支付交易中，超過70%經香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續穩步運作及發展。\n\n# 培養人才以加強銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業的持續增長，培養人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局非常重視銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業人員的持續能力建設。在於增強能力框架下引入反洗錢及反恐融資與網絡安全兩個模組後，我們去年擴展了其範疇，加入零售財富管理及財務管理，以透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業人員的核心素質。香港金融管理局亦致力於培養銀行業的年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作啟動了私人財富管理試行見習計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。考慮到這些計劃廣受歡迎，未來將進一步擴展其覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 穩健的投資策略，以實現中長期合理且穩定的回報\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的背景下，發鈔基金去年實現了創下歷史新高的投資收入，達港幣2640億元，各類資產均有不錯表現，包括股票、債券及外匯。總體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，而支援組合則獲取1.8%的回報。自2009年啟動以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部收益率已高達13.7%。雖然去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局持續謹慎管理發鈔基金。我們將保持靈活應變，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦性措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴大。一如往常，管理香港市民財富時，將在可接受風險範圍內，堅持「先保值、後增值」的投資原則。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年的增長動力，但2018年仍存在不少不確定性及風險。這些風險包括：若通脹回升，美國利率調升速度高於預期；貿易摩擦升溫以及地緣政治形勢惡化。若這些下行風險實現，將對全球金融市場產生重大且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟產生連鎖反應。因此，我們應謹慎管理風險。\n\n接下來幾個月，香港美元利率的變動將持續受到關注。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備系統已連續加息六次。隨著香港美元利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機也變得更強。近期香港美元面臨貶值壓力，並已觸發7.85弱方兌換保證（CU）。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金融管理局將扮演「超級貨幣交換者」的角色，透過在市場上買入香港美元及賣出美元，確保香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。這些操作屬正常範疇，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，目前貨幣發行局持有的資產價值超過4萬億港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，可為資本外流情況提供強大的緩衝。多年來，香港金融管理局已設立多項防線，以維護銀行及金融體系的穩定。從正面觀點看，資本外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金融管理局將保持警惕，盡一切努力維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年實現了經濟增長加快、勞動市場條件趨緊及通脹壓力受到抑制。2018年的經濟增長預期將維持強勁。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年增長更快。實質國內生產總值（GDP）增長增至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長，以及過去十年約3%的長期增長率（圖表1及表格1）。內需穩固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回升。強勁的內需反映就業與收入條件改善、資產價格蓬勃發展以及企業信心改善。在外在因素方面，香港貨品出口因全球貿易流動增加而擴張速度加快，服務業出口則因貿易及貨運流動活躍以及入境旅遊持續改善而恢復增長。貨品進口因出口帶動需求而增長強勁，服務業進口則因居民旅遊需求強勁而穩步上升。淨總貿易順差縮小，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣情況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率大致走弱，主要由利率套利活動推動，這是在港元與美元之間存在負利率差幅的背景下出現的。這反映聯匯制度按設計正常運作。雖然港元銀行間利率仍處於相對低水平，但受首次公開發行相關融資需求及銀行年底流動性需求影響，2017年底時面對更多上行壓力。就信貸增長而言，經過兩年單位數增長後，總銀行貸款在2017年顯著加快，增速達16.1%，反映經濟情況改善及金融市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長加快，銀行信貸發放標準未見放寬，整體貸款質素保持良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在2017年整體上持續受到控制（圖2）。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，核心通脹率降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。特別是，住宅價格指數的住宅部分增幅較為溫和，反映2016年私人住宅新租約租金增幅放緩的滲透效應。更廣泛而言，面對強勁的生產力增長，較溫和的實際工資與收入增幅有助於有效控制本地成本壓力。同時，進口價格通脹亦保持低水平，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況一致，即使美元貶值的情況下亦然。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，勞動市場趨緊，經濟成長超越預期。經季節調整後的失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。主要經濟部門的失業率均有下降，其中零售業、金融業以及專業及商業服務業的降幅較為顯著。隨著總體就業人數增長速度加快，私人部門的職缺數量也有所增加，整體勞動需求持續強化。勞動人口亦有所擴張，部分反映年長工作者（55歲及以上）參與勞動市場的積極性提高。與勞動市場趨緊及通貨膨脹率下降的情況一致，實質工資與所得增幅加快。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎無間斷上漲。恆生指數上升36%，為自2010年以來最大的年度漲幅（圖4）。此漲勢反映市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，部分得益於內地投資者透過滬港通及深港通帶來的大量資金流入。恆生指數於11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底維持在高水平。平均每日成交額由上一年的669億港元擴大至883億港元，而來自本地市場的總集資額亦增至5814億港元，較去年同期的4901億港元有所增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持上漲動能（圖4）。交易量從去年同期的54,701單位增至61,591單位，物業價格在2017年上升了14.8%。住宅物業可負擔性進一步惡化，價格收入比為16.4，高於1997年的歷史高峰，收入負擔比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均值。考慮到物業價格持續上升及銀行間按揭業務競爭加劇，香港金融管理局於5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以強化銀行風險管理及維護銀行體系穩定。這些措施使物業價格上漲暫時放緩，但第四季又重新加快。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，交易價值及交易量均實現雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格上漲，相應的租金回報率與去年相比略為下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預期將保持穩健。政府預測增長幅度將在3至4%之間，而私人部門分析師預測經濟將以平均3.2%的速率擴張。從外部看，香港的出口表現將持續受國際經濟增長預期改善及入境旅遊業逐步復甦所帶動。從內部看，私人消費增長預期將維持穩定，主要得益於有利的勞動市場條件。至於固定資本形成，建築及建設活動將因住宅供應增加及持續的基礎設施項目而穩步推進。雖然經濟條件改善將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能成為阻力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在全球通脹仍屬溫和及本地成本穩步上升的情況下，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年仍將保持溫和，但通脹率可能從2017年的低點逐步回升。例如，由於新租約私人住宅租金的增加所產生的傳導效應，通脹的租金成分或於2018年下半年加快上揚。市場共識預測，2018年的綜合通脹率仍將維持溫和的2.2%，而政府預計核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建設活動的擴張，以及入境旅遊逐步復甦，預計將在近期内維持勞動市場緊張的情況。私人機構分析師預測，2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性及風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望面臨若干不確定性及風險，包括與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及保護主義情緒升溫及地緣政治緊張局勢惡化等因素。特別是，若上述風險實現並引發香港資金流動逆轉，本地貨幣條件可能收緊速度快於預期，對實體經濟及資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的展望仍不確定。短期內，目前有利的國內經濟環境、被認為的住房短缺、低按揭利率以及替代性的住宅融資來源（包括物業發展商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支援）將繼續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能抑制市場情緒。長期而言，物業市場將繼續面臨多項不利因素。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續進行，國內按揭利率最終將上漲。此外，基於政府努力增加土地及住宅物業的供應，住宅需求與供應缺口預期將逐漸收窄，這將緩解長期物業價格上漲的壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年持續保持穩健，儘管面對全球經濟的不確定性。經授權機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況維持強勁，資產質素保持健康水平，並因利差擴大及信貸增長強勁而顯著改善盈利。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月定盤利率分別上升49基點及39基點。第四季的上漲情況更顯著。然而，以綜合利率為指標的零售銀行港元融資成本，全年大致維持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 獲利能力趨勢\n\n零售銀行香港分行的總體稅前營業利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入（+20.3%）和手續費及佣金收入（+9.4%）的增加。然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生產品業務收入（-29.9%）下降以及營運費用（+8.4%）增加所抵消。零售銀行的總體稅後利潤因2016年記入的某些非經常性項目而下降了18.1%。零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率從2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差在2017年從1.32%增至1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行的非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，從2016年的44.3%降至40%。而手續費及佣金收入成長9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生性商品交易的收入則下降29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，因營運成本（成長8.4%）增幅低於營運收入（成長11.8%）（圖表8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的港幣80億減少至港幣73億。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行的貸款品質在本年度有所改善，分類貸款比率由去年同期的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重新安排貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及重新安排貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素維持良好，違約率於2017年底維持在低水平的0.03%（圖10）。重組貸款比率接近0%。與去年同期的4宗相比，年底時沒有住宅按揭貸款出現負資產的情況。\n\n信用卡貸款違約率在2017年底維持在低水平，為0.22%，較去年同期的0.24%為低（圖10）。該期間內，逾期及重新安排貸款比率微幅下降至0.31%，較之前的0.33%有所減少。核銷比率亦小幅下滑至1.75%，較2016年的1.92%下降。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款在2017年增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%有所提升。信貸需求增加，受對全球經濟前景樂觀情緒的推動。由於總存款增長速度低於總貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從一年前的68.4%上升至2017年底的73%。港元貸款與存款比率亦在同一期間從77.1%上升至82.7%。（圖11）\n\n中國大陸相關貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在中國大陸子公司的貸款）於2017年增長17.5%，較2016年錄得的7%增長。\n\n# 可轉讓債務證券持有量\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管港元匯率面臨的壓力有所減緩，港元匯兌及貨幣市場仍能有序運作，流動性充足。聯繫匯率制度一直發揮強有力的支撐作用，維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定，並在面對各種衝擊時表現出高度彈性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定性。這被定義為香港貨幣的外部交換價值穩定，即在外汇市場上，香港貨幣兌美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由儲存在貨幣發行局的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包含：\n- 債務證書，用以完全擔保三間發鈔銀行發行的紙幣\n- 政府發行的流通中紙幣和硬幣\n- 總結算餘額，即銀行存於香港金融管理局結算賬戶的餘額總和\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發行基金票據和紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當港元需求高於供應，市場匯率上揚至強方兌換水平（1美元兌7.75港元）時，HKMA會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘額將擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元匯率離開強方上限並重新回到7.75至7.85港元兌1美元可兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。反之，若港元供應高於需求，市場匯率下跌至弱方兌換水平（1美元兌7.85港元）時，HKMA會從銀行購入港元。此時總結餘額將收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率離開弱方上限，並維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2017年港元兌美元匯率普遍面對較弱的壓力（圖1）。主要受港元與美元利率間負利率差幅擴大的利率套利活動所驅動，港元對美元逐步貶值，自1月3日的7.7566下跌至8月22日的年低點7.8265。至9月下旬至11月上旬期間，港元兌美元匯率一度獲強化支撐，主要由於首次公開發行（IPO）相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，匯率維持在7.80至7.81的窄幅波動。年底時港元再次面對較弱壓力，部分反映港元流動性條件略為改善，以及年底商業對美元需求增加。整體而言，港元兌美元匯市在2017年整體運作正常。\n\n由於CUs未被啟動，總結餘額及現有發行的EFBN總額維持不變，約為2017年的1,2253億港元（圖2）。當年，香港金融管理局發行總額為800億港元的額外發行基金債券，以應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加。這導致總結餘額於2017年底收縮至1798億港元。額外發行發行基金債券的發行符合貨幣發行局原則，因其僅反映貨幣基礎組成的變化，從總結餘額轉移到現有發行的EFBN。貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行間利率維持低檔，直至年底才面臨較大的上漲壓力（圖3）。儘管有對美國聯邦儲備系統升息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，港元銀行間利率在前八個月仍大致維持低檔。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負利率差幅在1月至8月期間擴大。從9月起，短債港元銀行間利率出現大幅上漲，主要由與IPO相關及年底融資需求所驅動。相應地，港元與美元利率之間的負利率差幅在短債部分收窄。整體而言，2017年短債銀行間利率多數時間低於基本利率。\n\n基準利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日分別上調，全年累計上調75個基點，由1.00%調升至1.75%。此調整係因美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍在本年內上調三次，總計上調75個基點，由0.50–0.75%調升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整係根據2009年3月26日公布的修正公式進行，該公式規定基準利率設置為美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍當前下限之上調50個基點，或香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的當日及一個月期利率之五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者為準。\n\n大致跟蹤港元與美元息差走勢，港元期貨點數的貼現幅度在前三個季度逐步擴大，12個月港元期貨點數於九月中達到約-615點（圖4）。第四季度，港元期貨點數的貼現幅度略有收窄，配合港元與美元息差負利差的收窄。整體而言，香港貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍充足。貼現窗口貸款從2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要支柱，並在一系列區域性和全球性金融危機中展現出高度的韌性。政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定更進一步強化了其承諾的可信度。香港貨幣作為支付手段及價值儲存工具，亦持續獲得強大的公眾信心。在2017年對香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯繫匯率制度的支持，並指出該制度仍是香港最適合的匯率安排。配合強健的金融監管與規範、謹慎的財政管理及靈活的市場機制，聯繫匯率制度已有效協助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織表示：「聯繫匯率制度仍是香港的最佳制度。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、與不動產相關及與內地相關貸款的監管工作，以提升銀行業的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統持續推進貨幣政策正常化，香港美元利率亦將逐步正常化。香港金融管理局重申，在LERS的設計框架下，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱邊際貨幣聯繫及貨幣基礎減少，均屬港元利率正常化的必要過程。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並充分準備應對潛在的金融動盪。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中分配特定部分用以支持貨幣基礎。背書比率（即背書資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年維持於106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據貨幣發行制度，雖然已指定部分發行基金資產用於支持組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發性衝擊時，發行基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大後盾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n發行基金顧問委員會的貨幣發行局子委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的各項事宜。2017年，CBC考慮了多項議題，包括香港樓價短暫波動的主因、HIBOR與倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、中國內地物業估值變動對企業融資的影響，以及按揭貸款償還負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些議題的討論紀錄及提交給CBC的貨幣發行局運作報告，均在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR已重新定位其活動，以更具政策相關性為導向。這尤其體現在其研討會活動及訪問學者計劃上。HKIMR與主要央行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為主軸的研討會。同時，自2016年推出的主題研究訪問學者計劃，已支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）關注的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究 fellows，並發表了29篇工作論文。該中心當年還舉辦了四場國際會議及研討會：\n- 第八屆國際中國經濟會議於1月在香港舉行，會議主題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處發展？」。該會議為學者、政策制定者及商業經濟學家提供一個討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題的平台。會上發表了11篇高質量研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構改革及國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導機制等多樣化的議題。\n- 第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會於7月舉行。該研討會旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供發表研究成果的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問 fellows之間的交流互動。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際清算銀行（BIS）聯合舉辦的「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」主題會議於8月舉行。該會議為深入且有見地的討論提供了平台，涵蓋了匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等重要議題。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備委員會（Fed）及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的「非傳統貨幣政策：所學經驗」主題會議於10月舉行。該會議回顧了過去十年內主要央行所推行的非傳統貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實質經濟與財務穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局持續將監管重點放在獲授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施亦被推出，以加強銀行業界對物業市場任何下行風險的抗風險能力。面對不斷上升的網絡威脅，香港金融管理局加強了對獲授權機構科技風險管理的監督。同時，香港金融管理局啟動了七項措施，以準備香港邁向智能銀行的新時代。反洗錢及反恐融資控制的成效，持續為香港金融管理局監管重點之一，作為其打擊金融犯罪的其中一環。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業及新創公司在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶所遇到的困難。同時亦加強對獲授權機構投資及保險產品銷售實務的監管，以進一步強化客戶保障。\n\n在國際監管及會計準則的本地落實方面已取得顯著進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比例、大額信貸風險敞口限制、回收計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號。為應對不斷變化的銀行環境及風險環境所帶來的能力建設需求，香港金融管理局與業界合作，推行董事賦權計劃及銀行從業人員增強能力框架。\n\n《金融機構（處理）條例》於2017年7月7日開始實施，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨部門機構處理機制的金融穩定委員會成員管轄區之一。該條例為金融穩定設立新的防線，賦予貨幣管理局必要的權力，以有序方式處理金融機構出現問題的情況，以防該等問題可能造成不利的系統性後果。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，以及在極端情況下以混亂方式倒閉，可能影響系統的穩定性。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在維護金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，透過確保銀行對衝擊具有抗風險能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止失敗。貨幣管理局負責在香港對銀行業務進行審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務。其職責亦包括在香港為持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司發牌，這些機構合稱為授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監管某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦非設計用以確保，一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，旨在確保在AI出現故障的情況下，能以有序的方式進行處理，以維持AI為其客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港已建立針對金融機構的解決機制，其中貨幣管理局為AI及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督工作概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局進行了192項非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級、公司治理、AI機構的業務運作及風險管理。為持續推動AI機構的風險治理，香港金融管理局與AI機構的董事會或董事層委員會舉行了30場會議，討論重點為重要風險管理議題。香港金融管理局亦進行了一項調查，以監測其最新公司治理指引的落實情況。同時，香港金融管理局亦與AI機構及其外部審計師舉行了27場三方會議。\n\n除離場活動外，香港金融管理局繼續進行定期的現場檢查，並配合針對高風險領域的主題審查。此方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於人工智能機構所面臨的 emerging 和更為重要的風險。香港金融管理局於本年度進行了401次現場檢查及主題審查。信貸風險管理及控制措施仍為這些檢查及審查的主要重點。另一重要關注領域為科技風險及運作風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加對流動性及市場風險管理以及反洗錢及反恐融資 (AML\/CFT) 控制措施的現場檢查次數，並針對這些領域進行更多海外檢查及主題審查。此外，專門團隊亦對人工智能機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公務員退休金計劃 (MPF) 相關業務活動進行現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監督\n\n# 信貸成長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款成長了16.1%，相較於2016年的6.5%成長率。如表2所示，貸款成長具有廣泛基礎。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增長17.5%至41,880億港元（表3）。其中包括6,440億港元貸款，為在香港註冊的銀行的內地子公司所發放。\n\n2017年，金融機構的資產質素維持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%微幅下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年起的長期歷史平均值2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，分類貸款比率則從0.85%下降至0.67%。至於與大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從0.82%微幅降至0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，該比率則從去年同期的0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n本年，香港金融管理局加強監管力度，確保授權機構持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強對授權機構對主要企業風險敞口的監測，並進行針對性的專題檢查，聚焦於貸款承批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及向房地產發展商貸款、資產支持融資及保險 premiums 融資的風險管理等關鍵信貸風險管理控制措施。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n2017年物業價格持續上升。有更多由授權機構提供的貸款涉及擁有多項按揭貸款的借款人或收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人。考慮到這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高授權機構所發放的新住宅按揭貸款的風險權重基準，以計算資本負擔；降低針對已有按揭貸款的借款人所提供的物業按揭貸款的貸款價值比（LTV）上限；以及降低針對收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人所提供的物業按揭貸款的負債服務比率（DSR）上限。\n\n自2009年起實施的香港金融管理局物業按揭貸款宏觀審慎政策，已提升銀行對物業市場風險的抗風險能力。在首次實施逆周期措施前，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2017年12月的49%。同時，平均負債服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月實施DSR上限時的41%降至2017年12月的35%（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到，一些發展商以高杠桿比率為其物業發展項目提供融資，並有部分發展商向買家提供貸款價值比高的按揭貸款。為應對這些發展項目所涉及的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日推出針對物業發展商貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求持牌銀行及財務機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求持牌銀行及財務機構為其對物業發展商的貸款撥備更多資本，特別是當貸款與股東資金比例較高時；並進行一輪主題審查，以確保銀行持續遵循謹慎的貸款審批標準，向物業發展商提供貸款。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局於二月與地政總署合作啟動了一項電子通報服務。該電子通報服務在抵押物的附加抵押向地政總署登記時，會通知相關的AI，以便抵押銀行可適時採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 監督作業與科技風險\n\n全年網絡安全威脅持續上升。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強監管力度，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。根據香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI），30間發行機構已完成對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）在與銀行及證券業廣泛諮詢後，共同決定引入強制兩步驗證用於網上股權交易。亦進行了一輪專注於銀行網絡安全控制及運營韌性的現場檢查。香港金融管理局進一步完成一輪與主要銀行高層管理人員的討論，以評估銀行如何應對由技術進步驅動的潛在新市場參與者所帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布了一套措施，協助香港銀行業轉型進入智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，HKMA將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括可供銀行及科技公司使用的聊天室功能，以及建立香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會及保險業監管局（IA）沙盒之間的連結，以提供一站式入口，用以進行跨行業金融科技產品的試驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦啟動了「銀行服務簡易計劃」，旨在識別並減少監管摩擦，以進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數字銀行服務的體驗。目前已成立專責小組，重點關注遠程開戶及賬戶管理、在線金融及在線財富管理。\n\n現行虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的推廣。\n\n# 財務活動監督與流動性風險管理\n\n美國持續正常化其貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能變得更加波動。基於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在今年加強了對流動性風險的監管重點。HKMA 透過增加更多情景，加強了其監管流動性壓力測試，包括資金外流的更嚴峻但合理的情景，以及短暫且由信心驅動的銀行擠兌情景。HKMA 同時加強監測與分析各機構的流動性狀況，並要求部分機構加強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局就 authorised institutions 的債務證券組合的市場風險管理進行了更多現場檢查。並進行了一輪主題審查，以評估 authorised institutions 增加投資外幣債券活動所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相應的風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖做法。\n\n# 預防洗錢及終止資金 (ML\/TF)\n\n2017年反洗錢及反恐融資（機構）（修訂）條例草案於6月23日公布，並於2018年生效。此項修訂旨在使香港的反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度與金融行動任務組（FATF）最新頒佈的國際標準保持一致。這些修訂與反洗錢及反恐融資法定指引的更新，有助於釐清及落實在開立帳戶及維持真實客戶過程中的客戶盡職調查（CDD）程序的風險為本方法，並在這些程序於遠端進行時鼓勵創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新舉措旨在促進金融科技在銀行及支付業的發展與應用，獲得各方及公眾的積極回應。香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際聲譽，亦因在該領域的網絡及能力建設方面所作出的一系列努力而進一步提升。債券通的啟動進一步鞏固了香港作為通往內地投資機會主要門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力亦已見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑑於科技的快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布啟動七項措施，以準備香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數碼零售支付的全面連通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才培育；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的引入；及\n- 推動「銀行易」（Banking Made Easy）新計劃，以減少顧客數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局網絡金融促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部門共同發揮至關重要的角色，帶動這些計劃的落實，以強化香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的定位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際聲譽進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作伙伴數目已從成立時的約40家增至截至2018年1月31日的87家。當年，IFFO舉辦及參與超過10場研討會及工作坊，促進關鍵利益相關方的經驗交流與合作網絡。特別是在其首屆債務融資及投資者圓桌會議中，IFFO推動制定基礎設施權益投資參考協議書，以提升基礎設施項目的融資可行性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月啟動，標誌著香港與內地資本市場雙向互通又一重大里程碑，並進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場之門戶地位。本年度，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者 (RQFII) 配額由人民幣2700億元增至人民幣5000億元。香港持續維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，活躍的人民幣金融中介活動亦可從我們人民幣實時結算系統 (RTGS) 的高交易量以及香港人民幣支付活動佔全球絕大多數的情況中得到體現。\n\n2016年公司財務中心（CTCs）稅制推出後，香港金融管理局加強推廣工作，以吸引更多跨国企業在港設立財務中心。截至2017年底，逾40間企業向香港金融管理局表示，正積極計劃或已設立財務中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際對影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題的討論。香港金融管理局首席執行官於四月成為財務穩定委員會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，以領導有關關鍵金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務中心的角色奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四間銀行間實時清算系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）實現了100%的系統可用性，較目標的99.95%有所提升。為支持債券通的北向交易，CMU已與兩家內地中央證券登記結算公司（CSDs）設立帳戶，以便利債券通交易的結算及代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業的整體安全與效率，香港金融管理局於八月根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（PSSVFO）指定四間零售支付系統（RPSs），以將其運作納入香港金融管理局的監管範疇。香港金融管理局亦對十六間積極推出新產品和服務的儲值支付工具發牌機構進行監管，這些新產品和服務旨在為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的使用體驗。另外，e- cheque及電子發票呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務的範圍進一步擴展，以涵蓋香港與廣東省全境之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 智能銀行方案\n\n面對快速的科技進步，香港金融管理局於九月宣布了七項舉措，為香港邁向智慧銀行新時代做準備。這些舉措旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將提供零售與企業客戶之間完整的互聯性，並使金融服務與交易得以以高度的靈活性、高效性、便捷性與安全性進行。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業及金融科技界密切合作，並在落實七項措施方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 更快的支付系統\n\nFPS 是一個多幣種平台，將讓公眾可透過手機號碼或電郵地址，全天候以即時方式輕鬆進行資金轉帳。該平台可支持港幣及人民幣付款。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與 FPS，實現所有支付參與者的全面連通。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，FPS 預計於2018年9月啟動。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡方案發卡機構、銀行、經許可的儲值支付工具發牌機構及商家收單機構，以建立香港零售支付的共同QR碼標準。共同QR碼標準將有助於商家使用單一QR碼接受來自多個支付服務提供者的QR碼支付方案，為消費者和商家帶來更大便利。該工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放式API 讓第三方得以存取銀行的資料，以促進銀行及其他行業所提供的服務更佳且更便捷的整合。用戶因此可留在同一系統內，於安全的環境中享受整合服務。為促進銀行業界對開放式API 的發展與採用，香港金融管理局已提出開放式API 框架草案，內容包括一組開放式API 功能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商管理、促進措施及維護模式，以進行兩月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培養\n\n其中一項重大研究專案聚焦於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。在2016年發布首份DLT白皮書後，於2017年10月發布了第二份DLT白皮書。該白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證案例，即貿易融資、數位身分管理與抵押貸款申請。同時，該白皮書也針對在銀行及支付產業中部署DLT所涉及的治理、法律與遵循事項，以及一般控制原則提供實務建議。\n\n香港金融管理局主席曾俊明先生在香港金融管理局金融科技日期間公布有關分布式账本技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n繼香港金融管理局領導的貿易融資概念驗證工作取得成功後，香港七間銀行決定將原型系統商業化，建立名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以實現貿易文件的數位化與共享、自動化流程，改善整體貿易流程並降低貿易融資業務中的風險及詐欺行為。\n\n為擴充金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作啟動了金融科技人才加速計劃。學生反應熱烈，共收到421名申請人提交的超過3,000份申請。最終，有74名學生接受香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，自7月起參與金融科技相關專案，實習期為六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n為加強我們在廣東-香港-澳門灣區的合作，我們與深圳攜手合作，推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於六月簽訂協議，內容包括：（一）為金融科技企業提供相互的軟著陸支持；（二）於十月共同舉辦深圳-香港金融科技獎，以表彰及獎勵兩城優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（三）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及技術金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳國強（中）於香港金融管理局金融科技日，與國際金融服務發展局總監何小軍（左）及創新科技園主席黎廣德博士簽署及交換有關金融服務過渡安排的備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎項電子小冊子\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局及阿布扎比金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，就創新項目、創新企業引荐、信息共享及專業知識交流等領域展開合作。\n\n11月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN），以連接新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易金融平台，建立跨境分布式账本技術基礎設施，以實現貿易及貿易融資流程的數位化，使其更安全、更高效且更具成本效益。該網絡將是一個開放平台，未來允許其他有意參與的司法管轄區加入。GTCN預計於2019年第一季啟動。\n\n# 金融科技監督沙盒\n\n2016年9月由香港金融管理局（HKMA）啟動的FSS已升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行及科技公司的溝通，促進新方案和措施的落實。具體而言，FSS 2.0的新增功能如下：\n- 設立金融科技監管對話室，以便在金融科技專案的早期階段為銀行及科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可透過尋求對話室意見直接使用FSS，無需經由銀行。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局的沙盒已連結，使跨領域金融科技產品的試點計劃擁有單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已進行測試的28項新科技產品中，有14個試點試驗已順利完成，相關產品已陸續推向市場。\n\n# 銀行簡化計畫\n\n為減少阻礙科技創新的規管摩擦，已啟動「銀行服務簡化計劃」。專責小組目前重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠距開戶及帳戶管理\n- 網上金融服務\n- 網上資產管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行由於無實體分行運作，預期將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並為行動及數位銀行服務帶來全新的客戶體驗。它們亦可能有助促進金融包容性，因其通常針對零售客戶群，無論是個人還是中小企業。香港金融管理局已啟動對現有《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 智慧銀行的新時代\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金融管理局去年公布的七項計劃，旨在為香港迎接智能銀行的新時代作準備，是一项涉及香港金融管理局內各部門之間合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆的趨勢，香港金融管理局銀行監管總經理陳瑞龍指出，作為監管機構，香港金融管理局必須緊貼最新科技發展，適時調整監管思維及方法，以提升銀行服務及客戶體驗至新高度。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2017 (including forward transactions)\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現優於預期。全球股市受益於主要發達及新興市場經濟體的同步經濟增長、強勁企業盈利，以及市場對主要央行緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策的預期而上漲。雖然美國聯邦儲備系統如預期般連續三次加息，並於10月開始縮減資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率維持穩定，美元對其他主要貨幣卻貶值（而非升值）。在這樣有利的環境下，證券投資基金於2017年的投資收入達2640億港元，創下歷史新高，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 交換基金\n\n發行基金根據《發行基金條例》所訂明的主要目標，是影響香港貨幣的兌換價值，無論是直接或間接的方式。該基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以協助香港維持國際金融中心的地位。發行基金由財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢發行基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於證券或其他適當資產。\n\n# 交易所資金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC為交換基金設定了以下投資目標：\n(a) 維持資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時刻均完全由高度流動性的美元計價資產支持；\n(c) 確保足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 受(a)至(c)的限制，實現投資回報以協助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n廣義而言，發行基金擁有兩個主要組合：支援組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支援組合（BP）持有高度流動的以美元計價資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場，以維護資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提高中長期回報，香港金融管理局已逐步將交易所基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別中，包括新興市場及大陸的債券和股票、私募股權及不動產。新興市場及大陸的債券和股票由投資組合（IP）持有，而私募股權及不動產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長組合（LTGP）下投資的市值上限設為交易所基金累計盈餘的三分之一，並透過將未來基金部分資產配置至長期資產，進一步擴大投資容量。\n\n2007年成立的戰略組合，用以持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金帳戶以戰略目的所購入，由於該組合的特殊性，因此不計入基金投資表現評估。\n\n# 與交易所基金的投資\n\n發行局不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的投資。利率一般與IP1表現掛鉤，唯未來基金則根據投資組合比例，與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為65:35。未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分預計將逐步增加至約50%水平，以至2018年。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程基於兩種資產配置的決策：戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標中，代表根據交易所基金的投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期實現優於指標的收益。這意味著實際配置往往與指標或戰略配置不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏差」。而指標及追蹤誤差上限由財政司與交易所基金管理局協商後確定，戰術性決策及戰術性偏差的允許範圍則由香港金融管理局根據授權制定。在戰術性偏差允許的範圍內，資產組合經理可採取立場以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局貯備管理部的員工直接管理金管局基金約73%的投資，其中包括整個BP及IP的一部分。這部分IP包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一組資產組合，以及各種衍生產品對沖組合，以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了 internally 管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請外部資產管理公司管理約27%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘請外部管理機構的目的是為了汲取市場上最優秀的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的投資回報，善用多樣化且互補的投資風格，並與發行基金分享市場見解及技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用，以及扣繳及其他稅務。此支出主要受市場因素影響，可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n2008\/09年全球金融危機後，金融市場的高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外部管理的投資組合已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監控對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持交易所基金投資多元化的加快步伐。風險控制工具被應用，以評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使香港金融管理局能善用內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 社會責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資。例如，香港金融管理局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發佈的《負責任所有權原則》，這些原則屬自願性質，協助投資者釐清如何履行其所有權責任，以應對其在香港上市公司的投資。在管理貨幣發行基金方面，香港金融管理局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合所委任的外部基金管理人，在管理投資時採納《負責任所有權原則》。此外，交易部及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入多項內部程序，以規範及監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切關注ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入投資流程。\n\n# 交換基金的表現\n\n# 2017年的金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟與金融市場表現優於預期。受益於主要發達及新興市場經濟體的同步經濟增長、企業獲利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策，全球股市表現良好。特別是香港股市上漲36%，表現超越其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場，短債美國國債收益率因美國聯邦儲備系統如預期般連續三次提高利率，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表而急升。然而，美國10年期國債收益率全年維持在約2.4%的水平。其他主要國家的10年期公債收益率也幾乎未變，唯獨德國國債因歐元區強勁的經濟增長及市場預期歐洲央行將緊縮貨幣政策而上漲。\n\n在外匯市場，美元對其他主要貨幣走弱，儘管美國聯邦儲備系統持續升息並開始縮表。美元貶值是因歐洲與日本經濟復甦，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策分歧將縮小。歐元與日圓分別對美元升值約14%與4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣以及債券與股市的表現如表1所示。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n# 交換基金的表現\n\n發行局於2017年錄得投資收入2640億港元。其中包括海外股票收益804億港元、香港股票收益583億港元、債券收益344億港元、非港元資產產生的正面貨幣折算收益535億港元，以及由發行局投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益374億港元。另外，戰略組合錄得評值收益45億港元。\n\n去年達2640億港元的投資收益為發行局的歷史新高，超越2007年的舊紀錄（1422億港元）達1218億港元。\n\n發行基金總資產於年底達港幣4,0153億。LTGP下的投資市值總計為港幣2,356億，其中私人股權為港幣1,572億，房地產為港幣784億。未償投資承諾總計為港幣1,624億。\n\n2017年交易所基金（不包括戰略組合）的投資回報率為7.4%。其中，IP組合的投資回報率為12.1%，而BP組合則獲利1.8%。LTGP自2009年成立以來的年化內部報酬率為13.7%。\n\n1994年至2017年交易所基金的年度回報請參見圖1。表2顯示2017年的投資回報及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年起的平均回報為4.9%。表3顯示基金資產在2017年12月31日的貨幣組成。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁羅伯特·黃先生（居中）在二零一七年交易所基金結果聯合記者會上發言。\n\n圖表 1 交換基金投資回報 (1994–2017)\n\n表2 發行局的投資回報（以港元計算）\n\n表3 2017年12月31日發行基金資產的貨幣組成（包括遠期交易）\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 給財政司司長的獨立審計師報告\n\n# 意見\n\n本人確認已審計載於第157至243頁之交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）財務報表，包括交易所基金及集團於2017年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該年度結業日之收支帳戶、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實而公平地反映該基金及集團於2017年12月31日之財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內之財務表現及現金流量，並符合香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈之香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」），且已按照證券及期貨條例（第66章）第7條下香港特別行政區行政長官所發出之指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據香港特別行政區首長根據《交易所基金條例》第7條頒佈的指示及會計委員會審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我的責任已在報告中「財務報表審計部分的審計師責任」一節中進一步說明。我根據這些準則與集團無關，並已根據這些準則履行其他倫理責任。我相信，我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n重要審計事項係指在吾專業判斷下，於2017年12月31日財務報表審計中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在財務報表整體審計過程中處理，並用以形成吾意見，吾並未就這些事項另行發表意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣當局二零一七年年度報告所載的所有資訊，除外財務報表及我方核數師關於該年度報告的報告。\n\n我對於財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，我並未就該資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中考慮該其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中所獲取的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為該其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此事實。就此事項，我無需報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及發行基金顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及行政長官根據《發行基金條例》第7條所作出的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並負責實施貨幣管理局認為必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表無重大錯報，無論該錯報係出於詐欺或錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營能力，披露與持續經營相關的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對於財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大不當陳述方面是否不存在，無論此不當陳述係出於詐欺或錯誤，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證代表高程度的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能發現已存在的重大不當陳述。不當陳述可能源自詐欺或錯誤，若單獨或合計起來，可能合理地影響基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我於整個審計過程中行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：  \n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大不實陳述的風險，無論該風險源自詐欺或錯誤，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。由於詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，因此未能察覺源自詐欺的重大不實陳述的風險，高於源自錯誤的風險；  \n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但此目的並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性之意見；  \n- 評估監管機構所採用的會計政策是否適當，以及會計估計及其相關披露是否合理；  \n- 對監管機構使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計師報告中提請關注財務報表中的相關披露，若披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我出具審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；  \n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露資訊，並評估財務報表是否以實現公允呈列的方式反映基礎交易及事件；以及  \n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊表達意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行，我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與交換基金顧問委員會審計小組就包括審計的計劃範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中所發現的重大內控缺陷等其他事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組提供聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用時說明相關保障措施。\n\n根據與發行基金顧問委員會審計小組溝通的事項，我已確定對本期財務報表審計而言最具重大影響的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或規範禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果合理預期將超過公開披露所帶來的公共利益效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n大衛孫 總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n根據財政司的授權，香港發行基金由財政司作為主管機構進行管理，並根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定。該基金的主要職能是保障香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性和完整性。\n\n基金的資產管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產完全與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私人股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港特別行政區政府為基金帳戶以戰略目的所購入的香港交易所有限公司股份。經營分部資訊詳見附註30。\n\n# 2 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該總稱包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次生效或可於現行會計期間提前採用。注3提供有關因首次採用這些準則而導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更在程度上與集團在這些財務報表所載現行及往期會計期間相關的情況。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司及合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合資企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按下列會計政策所述以公允價值計量：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需管理層作出影響會計政策應用及資產、負債、收入及支出所報告數額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設係基於經驗及其他各項因素，並在特定情況下認為屬合理，其結果成為評估那些非易於從其他來源顯而易見的資產及負債攜帶價值的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及基本假設會持續審查。會計估計的變更應在變更的期間內確認，若變更僅影響該期間；或在變更的期間及未來期間內確認，若變更同時影響當前及未來期間。\n\n第18項附註包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估所涉假設的資訊。第36項附註包含有關金融工具公允價值評估所涉假設的資訊。除這些公允價值評估所涉及的會計判斷外，於應用集團會計政策時，並無其他重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司為由集團控制之實體。集團控制實體，係指該集團因參與該實體而有權獲得變動回報，或曝露於變動回報，且能透過對該實體之控制權影響該回報。評估集團是否具控制權時，僅考量實質性權利（由集團及其他當事人持有）。\n"}
