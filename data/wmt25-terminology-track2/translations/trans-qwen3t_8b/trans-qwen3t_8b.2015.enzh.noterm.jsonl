{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015年亮點\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映內地需求疲弱及出口表現疲軟。本地股市因全球金融市場波動加劇而出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始趨於軟化。\n\n香港銀行業仍保持穩健。本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）資本充足，其流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質量略有下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n港元匯率對美元保持大致穩定，並於四月、九月及十月多次啟動強方兌換承諾。儘管全球金融市場環境波動，港元匯率市場仍能有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。繼美國聯邦儲備系統決定提高聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港基本利率於12月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n針對人工智慧的風險治理所進行的監管措施，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為，已加強。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施反周期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為國內系統重要性銀行。有關在香港為金融機構建立解決機制及加強存款保障計劃以實現更快賠付的立法建議，分別提交立法會。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，同時不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。有關改善稅務環境以推動香港成為企業財務中心的立法提案，已於12月提交立法會。\n\n香港仍為全球離岸人民幣業務中心，擁有廣闊且深遠的市場。內地與香港基金互認安排於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品組合。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因十二月成功啟動e-支票服務而進一步強化，讓客戶可網上發出及存入支票。新的監管制度，規定發牌多功能儲值設施及指定重要零售支付系統，於十一月開始運作。\n\n# 儲備管理\n在嚴峻且困難的投資環境下，發行局錄得總體投資回報率為 -0.6%。基金總資產達至港元3,4229億。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化的步伐，特別是透過長期增長組合（LTGP）的投資。截至2015年底，長期增長組合（LTGP）下的投資市值總計1421億港元，其中私人股權為913億港元，不動產為508億港元，並有1224億港元的未完成投資承諾。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。公司治理進一步得到改善，透過支持員工專業發展、建立嚴謹的財務紀律、加強機構安全及重新分配高層管理職責，以協助應對因推行新舉措及工作日益複雜而產生的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年經歷較慢的增長，反映內地需求疲弱及出口表現不佳。預期2016年經濟增長將維持疲軟，面對嚴峻的外部環境挑戰及金融市場條件脆弱。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟在今年的增長有所減緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增幅由2014年的2.6%減至2.4%（見表1）。這反映內在需求擴張較為溫和，不過淨出口再度成為GDP增長的正面因素，因總進口量下降速度高於總出口量（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平穩，勞動市場維持大致穩定，失業率保持在約3.3%的低水平。通脹進一步緩和，因國內成本及進口價格的壓力有所減緩。受全球金融市場波動升溫的影響，本地股市出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始出現軟化跡象，至年底樓價進一步顯示出整固跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實質國內生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出組成分類的實質GDP成長（期對期）\n\n注意：經季節調整的國內固定資本形成總額季度對季度變動率目前不可用。\n來源：普查及統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣政策方面，2015年維持了匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在約7.75附近。由於與股權相關的資金流入，4月觸發了強方兌換保證措施，9月及10月則因離岸人民幣兌換港元及部分商業需求港元而再次觸發。隨著總結餘擴大，本地利率持續維持在低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在12月中美國利率調升後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩，由2014年的12.7%減至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體貸款質素略為惡化，但分類貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n2015年國內需求成長速度放緩。雖然就業與收入情況廣泛穩定，持續提供支撐，但弱勢的消費者信心與資產價格修正則拖累私人消費成長，尤其在年中後半段表現較弱。然而，由於首季較強勁的成長動能，全年私人消費成長率從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費則以較快速度成長，增幅達3.4%。事實上，國內需求成長放緩的主要原因在於固定資本形成減少2.2%（圖2）。受企業信心走弱影響，私人部門機械與設備採購連續第二年縮減，同時，建築與營造活動也因公共建設進度緩慢而呈現較弱的成長動能。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港2015年的出口表現惡化（圖3）。商品出口出現廣泛下跌，跌幅達1.7%，為2009年以來首次。出口至日本及歐盟的表現下滑，而出口至美國則僅有微幅增長。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦對區域內工業活動及區域內貿易造成壓力。因此，香港對中國大陸、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體的中間及最終需求疲弱而減少。香港服務業出口持續從過去幾年的高增長路線放緩，2015年更出現0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。商品進口亦因國內及出口引致需求疲弱而回落。相較之下，服務業進口因本地居民旅遊需求強勁而加快增長。以淨額計算，香港2015年的總貿易順差略有改善，對GDP增長作出小幅正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 國內需求 來源：統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，核心通貨膨脹進一步緩和，因國內成本壓力有所減輕，進口價格通脹亦減緩。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，核心通貨膨脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。經濟活動疲軟，勞動成本壓力維持穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所減輕，尤其在第二季。由於全球商品價格回落及強勢港元，進口價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦維持低水平。因新租賃住宅租金在較早季度的傳導效應溫和，通脹的租金成分仍受到控制。\n\n圖表 3 商品及服務出口 來源：人口普查及統計處\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價通貨膨脹 來源：統計處\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場情況維持穩定。勞動需求維持強勁，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業減少 largely 被其他商業部門穩步招聘所抵消，導致總就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。勞動供給也增加1.3%，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖表5）。考慮到勞動市場依然緊俏，工資在名義上於前三個季度上升了4.7%，較2014年的4.3%有所提高。隨著通脹壓力緩和，實質工資在前三個季度增長了1.3%，較2014年下降0.1%的表現有所改善。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市因外部環境出現劇烈變動而經歷波動的一年。首季表現持平，但隨着內地A股市場看漲情緒興起及資金流入，本地股市在第二季表現積極。4月恆生指數急升至七年來最高水平，南向每日額度在2014年11月啟動以來首次用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地市場轉向下跌，受內地A股市場及全球股市拋售潮、全球外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格走弱等因素影響，恆生指數在9月跌至年度低點，跌幅達28%。隨著全球及內地金融市場逐步穩定，本地股市在第四季有所回升。2015年全年，恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然第二季集資活動減緩，但來自本地股市的股本集資總額仍由去年同期的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段活躍期後，住宅物業市場隨後在2月第七輪審慎措施公布後趨於軟化。截至去年第四季，樓價上漲速度放緩並隨後下跌，2015年樓價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%至55,982單位，因二級市場交易活動在第二季明顯減少。炒家交易，包括確認交易及短線倒賣交易，持續維持低水平。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍受壓，樓價收入比達到15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均水準。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但交易活動隨後趨於軟化，價格及租金在去年第四季均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖表6 資產價格 資料來源：評級與評估部及香港交易所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預期將維持疲軟。私人機構分析師預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府則預測增長幅度將在1至2%之間。更具體而言，疲軟的全球增長前景、持續疲軟的入境旅遊以及波動的全球金融市場環境所帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。國內方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因經濟動能較弱，勞動市場情況可能面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或會削弱消費信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及建設活動或可維持穩定，但企業信心疲弱及利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n2016年的通貨膨脹壓力預期將維持在可控範圍內。進口價格壓力預期將維持緩和，而國內成本壓力在經濟成長動能溫和的情況下，預期將保持溫和。通貨膨脹中的租金成分也可能因2015年底新租賃住宅租金壓力減緩而緩和。市場共識預測2016年的通貨膨脹率為2.5%，而政府預測基礎通貨膨脹率為2.0%。勞動市場也可能因入境旅遊放緩及出口產業持續低迷而有所緩和。民間機構分析師預期2016年的失業率將升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年的經濟展望面臨多項不確定性和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的速度、全球增長前景及商品價格走勢將持續成為主要不確定因素。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊國內貨幣與金融條件，並對香港的增長前景投下陰影。這些外部因素對國內經濟的影響將取決於它們透過財富效應及資產負債表效應對房地產市場的影響。儘管房地產市場正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場情緒走弱、美國利率正常化及住宅需求與供應缺口收窄所帶來的下行風險，但仍有待更多時間才能確定房地產市場是否已進入下行週期。儘管房地產市場的急劇調整可能對整體經濟造成重大阻力，但過去幾年引入的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施已顯著增強香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在本年維持穩健，儘管先進經濟體貨幣政策出現進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體風險積聚增加。獲授權機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的AIs資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持健康水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行間利率全年維持在低水平。零售銀行的港元融資成本上半年因複合利率呈現下降趨勢而下降，下半年則維持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖表7 HIBOR定盤利率、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率（BLR）\n說明：\n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣兌換率在2015年整體維持廣泛穩定，儘管面對波動的金融市場環境以及12月美國聯儲局加息。貨幣市場亦持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。作為香港過去數十年貨幣及金融穩定的核心支柱，聯繫匯率制度持續表現出高度具備抗風險能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外汇市場上對美元的匯率波動範圍維持在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元之內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是以貨幣發行局制度為核心，要求貨幣基礎至少以100%的美元儲備為後盾，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包含\n\n* 債務證券，其為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供完全擔保  \n* 政府發行的流通中紙幣和硬幣  \n* 總結算餘額，即銀行在貨幣發行局的結算賬戶餘額總和  \n* 由貨幣發行局代表政府發行的發行基金票據和紙幣\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當港元需求大於供應，市場匯率強勢升至每美元7.75港元的強方兌換保證水平時，HKMA會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘額將擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元匯率離開強方限制、重新回到7.75至7.85港元兌1美元可兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場匯率下跌至每美元7.85港元的弱方兌換保證水平時，HKMA則會向銀行購入港元。此時總結餘額將收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元匯率離開弱方限制，並維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的可兌換範圍內。\n\n本處所顯示的債務證券及政府發行流通中的貨幣紙幣和硬幣，其面值均以港元計。本年度報告中發行基金資產負債表所顯示的相應項目，其港元金額等同於該項目兌換所需美元金額，並以資產負債表日期的當日匯率計算。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\nherein 所顯示的EFBN數額與本年度報告中發行局的資產負債表所載數額有所不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表發行局持有的EFBN，用以對沖其在二級市場交易中發行的EFBN，並以淨額記入資產負債表。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2015年香港貨幣兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，兌美元波動範圍維持在7.7500至7.7657之間（圖1）。2015年初，受市場對美國加息的擔憂影響，香港貨幣一度面臨輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季香港貨幣兌美元匯率上漲至接近7.75，主要因4月股市活動熱絡，與資產相關的香港貨幣需求急升，導致強方兌美元匯率上限反覆觸發。進入年下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著沽售，以及全球外匯市場（包括人民幣）波動增加，香港貨幣兌美元匯率仍維持在接近7.75的水平。受離岸人民幣轉換為香港貨幣的推動，9月及10月強方兌美元匯率上限再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，但香港貨幣兌美元匯率仍維持在緊密範圍內，未見顯著外流壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場波動，香港貨幣兌美元匯市在2015年整體運作有序。\n\n圖表 1：2015 年市場匯率\n\n由於強方貨幣供應（CU）於四月、九月及十月多次觸發，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據貨幣發行局原則，以總計2272億港元向銀行換取293億美元，導致總結餘相應擴張，其中部分擴張被銀行對流動性管理強烈需求所引致的額外發行基金紙幣所抵銷（圖2）。額外發行發行基金紙幣與貨幣發行局原則一致，因該舉措代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，而貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。總結餘及發行基金紙幣及紙幣的未償還總額，由2014年底的992.5億港元增至2015年底的1,221.0億港元。\n\n圖表 2 總餘額及 2015 年未結清發鈔基金紙幣\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於銀行體系內流動性充裕，港元銀行間利率在2015年整體維持低水平。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）自0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，根據預設公式，港元基本利率亦於12月17日上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年港元銀行間利率（期限由隔夜至三個月）均低於基本利率（圖3），並因銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動導致流動性收緊而出現溫和波動。廣泛跟蹤香港銀行間拆借利率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）之間的利差，港元期貨點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著 premiums，隨後因美元利率廣泛上調而於年底轉為折扣（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款活動不活躍，2015年僅有280億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖表3 2015年港幣銀行間利率\n\n圖表4 港幣遠期點數 2015\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）持續運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。考慮香港為一個小而開放的經濟體，以及其作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定不移地維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，市民對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存手段持續保持強大信心。在2015年對香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯繫匯率制度為香港最優的貨幣安排，指出香港強健的制度、法律及政策框架、豐厚的財政儲備、靈活的市場及穩健的金融體系是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及其壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的抗風險能力。面對美國利率上升的情況，香港金融管理局提醒公眾做好風險管理的必要準備工作，指出觸發弱方保證金及港元流出是港元利率正常化的自然且必要的過程。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分用以支撐貨幣基礎。2015年，支撐比率（定義為支撐資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3至107.5%的窄幅範圍內，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平，並於12月31日收市於106.3%（圖5）。根據LERS，雖然已將特定發行基金資產指定用作支撐組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源在面對突發性衝擊時，可提供強大的後盾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖表5 2015年後援比率每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n發行基金顧問委員會 (EFAC) 貨幣發行委員會小組監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組曾考慮包括全球銀行提供國際美元貸款的供應、國際上宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國利率上升對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的釐定公式、港元實際有效匯率上升對宏觀經濟的影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險等議題。該小組的討論紀錄及提交給小組的貨幣發行局運作報告，均在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。2015年，該學院接待16位研究員，並發表27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構主辦了五場國際會議及研討會。主要的包括：\n\n* 一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議發表了11篇高質量研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行業競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。\n* 五月由香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦的「HKIMR-HKU 國際財經與經濟成長研討會」，探討多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 十月由香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦的「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會，探討貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率的關係、貨幣政策分歧及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策的外溢效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n該機構亦於八月主辦了第十三屆HKIMR暑期研討會，並於九月舉辦第十三屆HKIMR大陸經濟會議，探討中國大陸財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。這些會議與研討會吸引了來自學界、金融服務業及全球央行的參與者。此外，該機構本年度還舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n2015年底，流通中的紙幣總值為港幣3602億，較去年同期上升5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通總值為港幣112億，上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。流通中的政府發行港幣10元紙幣總值為港幣40億，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險治理上，包括貸款及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。隨著系統性風險的積聚，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布在香港實施0.625%的地區反週期資本緩衝（自2017年1月1日起提高至1.25%）。五間獲授權機構被指定為國內系統重要性銀行，將適用更高損失吸收能力資本緩衝。在《金融機構（處理）條例》提交立法會後，有關復原及解決機制的改革取得重大進展。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業的合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融專業人士的專業技能及知識培訓。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的背景下，新興市場面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的風險。為維持銀行業對可能出現的宏觀經濟環境急劇惡化所具備的韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監察獲授權機構（AIs）的風險治理有效性及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，以定期現場檢查為基礎，並增加主題性審查的數量。主題性審查為深入的非現場審查，專注於特定風險領域或選定機構組別的特定業務活動。此方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於機構的新兴及更重大風險。\n\n本年，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢討。為應對資產質素惡化跡象的出現，並針對授權機構貸款組合的資產質素問題，加強了有關信貸風險管理及資產質素的深入主題性現場檢討。面對主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分化所引致的市場不確定性，香港金融管理局亦增加對財務相關活動的檢討次數。此外，亦針對與內地相關的業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、操作及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）措施及授權機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型進行現場檢討。本年亦有專門團隊對授權機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的活動進行現場檢討。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相同範疇的領域。表1包含運作監督工作的詳細資訊。\n\n2015年進行了196次非現場審查，以評估授權機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點放在風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾三號協議標準的落實監測上。監管團隊與所選授權機構的董事會及外部審計機構保持密切聯繫。與授權機構的高階管理階層及外部審計機構舉行了20場三方會議，並與所選授權機構的全體董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了23場會議。\n\n銀行業監督審查委員會審查了四個案例，所有案例均與人工智能的授權有關。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對多項緊急事項，香港金融管理局持續行使《銀行條例》第59(2)條賦予的權力，要求獲授權機構委任外部會計師跟進可能具有重大影響的監管事項。2015年，香港金融管理局根據該條款委託進行六份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，另兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，而餘下兩份則與證券相關業務及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，獲授權機構均未違反銀行條例有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。各條款下共有84宗違規情況，但均未影響存款人權益，且已迅速處理。\n\n表1 運營監督\n\n# 根據銀行條例第五十二條所賦予的權限\n\nMellie Bank有限公司繼續受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力行使的約束。2008年6月25日，貨幣管理局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對 Mellie Bank有限公司香港分行的業務、營業及財產所作出的指示，在本財政年度內仍然有效。貨幣管理局將繼續與相關當局保持定期溝通，以監控該分行及其英國總行的相關發展情況，並留意已採取的監管措施，以保障AI存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL審批委員會審查並確定各AI機構的綜合CAMEL評級。各AI機構已獲通知其評級，並被給予申請複核的機會。本年度內無任何機構提出複核申請。\n\n# 專業的監督工作\n\n# 監督操作及技術風險\n\n香港金融管理局繼續發佈有關運作及科技風險管理的新增或更新指引，考慮到新興風險及行業發展。特別是香港金融管理局已完成對監管政策手冊（SPM）中電子銀行（e-banking）部分的修訂，使合资格機構在提供新電子銀行服務時更具靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局發佈有關網絡安全的通函，重申合资格機構的董事會及高層管理層需監督有效的網絡安全風險管理。香港金融管理局亦定期發佈其「運作事件通報」，重點分析特定詐騙案件或運作事件的操作手法，並指出所識別的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局推行以風險為本的主題性現場及非現場監管審查，評估部分獲授權機構在企業層面或特定業務線中就其運作及科技風險管理的狀況。這些審查涵蓋與獲授權機構運作風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防範違規交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、詐欺風險管理及反洗錢技術控制相關的特定領域。這些監管審查亦由年度獨立合規測試補充，測試範疇包括運作風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性計劃，有關獲授權機構須委任獨立且具資格的評估師，審查其相關控制措施的充分性，並針對所識別的弱點進行改善。香港金融管理局亦識別及分析獲授權機構運作及科技風險的趨勢及重點監管關注點，特別針對在維護香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定及有效運作方面發揮重要作用的獲授權機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業實施基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，該技術使自動櫃員機於2015年底完成純信用卡的卡片更換程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制措施，以進一步提升無卡交易的保安水平。另外，接獲報告指某些無接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可被隱蔽地存取後，香港金融管理局要求有關發卡機構立即採取行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投放資源宣傳及解釋事件的規模及影響，以緩解公眾關注，並監察發卡機構的補救措施，包括及時更換受影響的卡片。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他相關當局合作，推行多項措施，包括舉行網上銀行安全預防措施的公眾意識提升計劃、建立一個分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為由香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇主辦、涉及人工智能公司及其他金融機構的危機管理演習提供支持與建議。\n\n# 資產管理及強積金相關業務監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就授權機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及進行監督。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管局理事會的主持下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議覆蓋不同金融服務行業領域中具有密切業務往來的金融集團或受監管機構所涉及的各項問題，以確保更協調及有效的監管行動。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了25次現場及非現場主題審查及15次非現場對自動理財系統（AI）的監察。這些審查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算及客戶證券保管的處理，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期人壽保險（NLTI）產品及MPF相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局發出通函予合資格機構，就向客戶銷售NLTI產品的過程中的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助合資格機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局持續與財政及庫務局（FSTB）緊密合作，推動《保險公司（修訂）條例2014》的立法程序，以設立獨立的保險業監管局及為保險中介人建立法定牌照制度。七月，立法會通過《保險公司（修訂）條例2015》，其中規定貨幣管理局透過授權，可就保險中介人活動進行檢查及調查。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由註冊機構提出的從事其他受規管活動的申請。其並批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券業務的高級管理人員，並對由註冊機構提交資料、擬納入香港金融管理局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行背景審查。\n\n# 財務活動的監督\n\n合資機構的流動性風險管理持續為香港金融管理局的首要監管重點，尤其在預期美國利率將逐步正常化，以及隨後可能出現的資金流動反轉對合資機構流動性狀況造成影響的情況下。2015年全年，香港金融管理局持續實施增強的穩定資金要求，以確保合資機構擁有足夠的穩定資金支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾三協議流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）後，香港金融管理局已開始監測一級機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構的LCR通常維持在接近或超過100%的水平，遠高於2015年分階段實施安排下法定最低標準60%。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）針對選定的授權機構的風險管理控制架構，就預期的利率正常化相關風險進行主題性現場檢查。在市場波動期間，香港金融管理局亦密切關注市場突變及其對銀行業及個別授權機構的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 主管驅動壓力測試方案\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上監管機構主導的壓力測試計劃，以更好地了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟環境下的韌性，並鼓勵他們制定計劃以應對壓力時期可能出現的問題。本年度推出多項改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料，深入了解特定領域的風險動態。香港金融管理局分析了參與機構提交的結果，並與他們討論如何進一步改善其壓力測試程序。\n\n# 貸款風險管理與資產質量\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n過去幾年觀察到的強勁信貸成長趨勢自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年而言，銀行業總貸款增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降（表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從去年同期的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境面臨重大挑戰，呼籲加強國際間的合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。信用評級機構繼續認可香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現，標準普爾亦維持香港的最高評級AAA。\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題的國際討論。今年七月，該局接任亞洲區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定委員會成員與非成員之間在政策倡議上的交流，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進有關金融穩定議題的意見交流。香港金融管理局持續與東亞合作體各當局緊密合作，強化已升格為國際組織的東亞合作體宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作，以監測與分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n本年，香港離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而出現一定程度的收縮。然而市場仍能有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易保持穩定增長。此外，香港進行及透過香港進行的人民幣業務不斷擴張，亦促成了國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣認可為可自由使用的貨幣。IMF將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子的決定，將有助於推動人民幣國際化以及香港離岸市場的進一步發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務中心的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。二零一五年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，同時，場外衍生工具交易庫存持續支持機構按於七月推出的新的場外衍生工具市場監管框架要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年進一步加強了香港的金融基礎建設，新增了多項組成部分及服務，包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著目前已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及行動通訊渠道，為客戶接收及處理電子支票。自2013年推出電子發票展示及付款（EBPP）服務後，2015年商家參與度持續增長。7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMu）在其資金訂單路由服務下推出了一項服務，以支持內地與香港互認基金機制（MRF）的落實。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦於11月隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）的生效而得到改善。根據PSSVFO，香港金融管理局獲授權推行針對多用途儲值支付工具的強制性牌照制度，並履行相關監管及執行職能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全有效地運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際及區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場之間聯繫的加強，香港金融管理局積極推動與其他司法管轄區的合作，透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定委員會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），以促進可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管協調小組（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦該小組第九次會議。RCG(A)為FSB成員及非成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，以處理財務穩定議題。來自16個亞洲地區財政部、中央銀行及金融監管局的高階代表出席會議，討論該地區所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險制度的經驗。香港金融管理局亦於八月在香港主辦一場有關宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）組織，並邀請來自世界各地18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了有關宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、其與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能產生的外溢效應。香港金融管理局亦與英格蘭銀行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同主辦一場會議，討論中央銀行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策的最佳組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引逾百名與會者參與，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 推動亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局持續履行其對推動亞洲金融穩定及發揮地區集體聲音參與國際金融事務的區域合作計劃的承諾。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行會議（EMEAP）下貨幣與金融穩定委員會宏觀監測工作的協調員，香港金融管理局繼續準備委員會的半年度宏觀監測報告，以評估地區的風險與脆弱性及政策影響。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準及最佳實踐，以及國內及跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗分享與資訊交換工作。同時，香港金融管理局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展子組。香港金融管理局於六月在香港主辦EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議，會議由來自地區17個機構及主要經濟體的代表出席，審視金融市場最新發展及金融監管改革情況。\n\n去年香港與東亞+3主管機關簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在加強版CMIM下的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切溝通，以提供對香港經濟表現及財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成了2015年所有主要信用評級機構均肯定香港的信用評級。標準普爾確認其給予香港最高的AAA評級，反映機構對香港高收入經濟體高於平均水平的增長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現及強勁的淨外資產地位的認可。摩根士丹利投資服務公司及菲奇評級機構亦分別維持香港的評級於Aa1及AA+級，僅低於三A級一個級別。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣池產生影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款及存款憑證餘額達人民幣1,0100億元，較去年同期人民幣1,1580億元有所減少（圖1）。受內地市場利率下降影響，離岸人民幣債券發行有所減緩，因此香港人民幣債券發行量降至人民幣750億元。另一方面，由香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長9%至人民幣6,8330億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦年增58%至人民幣2970億元（圖2）。人民幣實時結算系統（RTGS）的平均每日成交額增至人民幣9470億元，較2014年成長29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴張，調查結果顯示，截至2015年4月底，每日成交額約為930億美元，較2013年4月進行的上一次BIS三週年調查時成長88%。香港仍是規模廣泛且深厚的離岸人民幣業務中心。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是7月實施的MRF計劃，該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品組合。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策舉措，以及與業界合作加強香港人民幣金融平台的聯手行動持續取得成效。今年六月，中国人民银行（PBoC）宣布，境外人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行將可於境內銀行間債券市場進行回购交易並將所得資金調回境外，以協助境外市場銀行管理人民幣流動性。九月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣資金池管理規則，使更多跨国公司可在簡化安排下進行集團內部資金調撥。同時，大陸當局於七月亦為外國央行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金提供更廣泛的境內銀行間債券市場准入權，並於九月進一步開放大陸外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2016年10月1日起，國際貨幣基金組織宣布將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子。此決定確認人民幣作為可自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步提升市場對人民幣用於全球交易的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球人民幣離岸業務中心，香港將因人民幣進一步國際化及內地與全球經濟金融體系深度融合而帶來的新業務機會而受惠。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，並與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，亦與馬來西亞及泰國第二次合作舉辦私人部門關於人民幣業務的討論。透過這些舉措，香港銀行加強了與其他市場的人民幣業務流動及聯繫，將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強參與本地及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本及非洲）的行業活動，積極推動企業及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面更廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉志強先生於2015年12月11日舉行的香港–倫敦人民幣論壇第五屆會議期間，於一個研討會上發言。\n\n# 《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》\n\n2014年在廣東省推出的試點自由化措施已擴展至全國範圍內，根據《緊密經貿合作安排》(CEPA)框架，內地與香港於11月簽署了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。新協議原則上給予香港銀行與內地銀行相同的國家待遇，預期將為這些銀行在內地從事業務提供更多的政策確定性及更大的經營靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀監會的官員提供培訓課程。除涉及中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，還包括消費者保護、信用參考資料、貨幣及擔保管理、財務健全指標分析及系統性風險監測等主題。亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦了特別培訓課程。\n\n# 國庫券方案\n\n本年，香港金融管理局舉辦了八次機構發行的政府債券招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，機構發行的政府債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此嚴峻且困難的投資環境下，交易所基金於2015年實現整體投資回報率為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及可比的投資基金相比，其虧損情況相對較為輕微，這歸功於香港金融管理局（HKMA）過去多年推行的一系列防禦性措施，這些措施已提升交易所基金的抗風險能力。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n發行基金根據發行基金條例所訂定的主要目標，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定及完整性，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。發行基金由財政司司長控制，並經諮詢發行基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所資金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC 已設定下列投資目標，針對交換基金：\n\n(a) 保持資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高度流動性以美元計價的資產支持；\n(c) 確保足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 受(a)至(c)之限制，以實現有助於維持基金長期購買力之投資回報。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n廣義而言，交易所基金設有兩個主要組合——後備組合及投資組合。後備組合持有高流動性的美元計價資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩大組合整體的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更有效地管理風險並在中長期提升回報，香港金融管理局已謹慎且逐步地將發行基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及物業投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為發行基金累計盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下投資的市場價值總計為1,421億港元，其中私人股權為913億港元，物業投資為508億港元，未償投資承諾則達1,224億港元。\n\n2007年成立的戰略組合，用以持有香港交易所有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金帳戶以戰略目的所購入，由於該組合的特殊性，因此不納入基金投資表現評估範疇。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置決策為基礎——戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基准中，代表根據證券交易所基金的投資目標所制定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略性資產配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期實現超越基准的超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基准配置或戰略性配置有所不同。實際配置與基准配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏移」。雖然基准及戰術性偏移的範圍是由財政司與金融管理局（EFAC）協商後確定，但戰術性決策則是由香港金融管理局在委託權限下作出。在戰術性偏移允許的範圍內，資產組合經理可建立頭寸，以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約76%的發行基金投資，包括整個支持組合及投資組合的一部分。該投資組合的一部分包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一組組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的多種衍生工具對沖組合。\n\n# 外部管理人員的運用\n\n除了 internally 管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理人，以管理約24%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產。聘請外部管理人的目的是為了利用市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以捕捉多樣化的投資風格，並將市場的知識和資訊轉移給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用，以及扣繳及其他稅務。此支出主要受市場因素影響，可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並嚴格監控對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險控制工具被應用以評估在正常及不利市場環境下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部管理者的投資專業能力。\n\n# 交易所基金績效\n\n# 2015年的金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場高度波動。股市，尤其是，遭遇了異常波動。主要股市在上半年創下新高。然而，市場情緒在第三季度急劇惡化，由於中國大陸經濟增長擔憂，主要股市當年累計漲幅被扭轉，並出現顯著季度虧損。全球股市隨後在市場情緒改善的同時有所復甦，但年底再度走低。由於與中國大陸經濟緊密聯繫，香港股市在2015年表現不如其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場上，儘管市場預期美國利率正常化以及美國利率上行週期的啟動，但2015年美國長期國債收益率仍小幅上漲，因全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續存在的全球通縮壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢抑制了正面情緒。另一方面，歐洲短債收益率下跌，部分甚至跌入負值區域，這歸因於歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元在2015年持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，在美國政策利率正常化啟動的預期背景下。歐元在第一季度顯著走弱，創下自1999年歐元成立以來最大的單季跌幅，因歐洲央行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元基本維持不變。\n\n二零一五年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 交換基金的表現\n\n在極度波動的金融市場及困難的投資環境背景下，2015年貨幣發行基金錄得投資虧損158億港元，其中包括海外股票的獲利71億港元、香港股票的虧損50億港元、債券的獲利159億港元、非港元資產的負貨幣兌換效應449億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司所持其他投資的獲利111億港元。由於去年美元大幅升值，將貨幣發行基金的非美元投資轉換為港元時，負貨幣兌換效應無法避免。另外，戰略投資組合錄得評值增值22億港元。\n\n交易所基金的總資產於2015年底達港幣3,4229億。2015年，交易所基金（不計戰略組合）的投資回報為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現不佳的主要市場指數及投資基金行業整體相比，交易所基金的虧損可視為輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在過去幾年已採取一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化的步伐，尤其是透過LTGP下的投資。這些措施已提升交易所基金的抗風險能力，並有助減輕部分潛在虧損。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年化報酬率請參見圖表1。表格2顯示2015年的投資報酬以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資報酬率。過去三年的平均報酬率為1.2%，過去五年的平均報酬率為1.8%，過去十年的平均報酬率為3.3%，自1994年起的平均報酬率為5.0%。表格3顯示基金於2015年12月31日的資產幣別組成。\n\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持有資產。  \n2. 綜合消費物價指數根據以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算。\n"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各種其他渠道與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。在2015年，香港金融管理局透過支持員工專業發展、建立嚴謹的財務紀律、加強信息保安及重新分配高層管理職務，以應對新計劃及系統實施及工作複雜性增加所帶來的挑戰，從而改善公司治理。\n\n# 社區參與企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及推動公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年舉行了59項公開媒體活動，包括14場記者會、14場面對面訪問及31項其他公眾活動。此外，另安排了43次媒體訪問，發佈325份雙語通訊稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，分別舉辦兩場媒體參觀活動，帶領媒體到香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL）參觀，展示香港世界級的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。並舉辦教育研討會，介紹貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及發行基金，以提供有關這些重要議題的更深入簡介。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁諾曼·陳（中）及貨幣管理高級總監霍華·李（右）在媒體訪問香港印鈔有限公司期間，檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n在香港國際商業信貸銀行（HKICL）進行的媒體巡禮中展示的自動化支票分類示範。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳國強先生、財務基礎設施執行總監李家強先生，以及香港國際商業信貸銀行總裁譚慧珊女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供有效途徑，以向香港金融管理局獲取資訊，使他們更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策與規則、紙幣硬幣及消費者銀行服務等議題。經典例子包括不動產按揭貸款的財務監管措施、銀行產品及服務、防範洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起收到的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則提供2015年查詢類別的詳細分項分析。\n\n圖表 1：公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局年報外，香港金融管理局過去一年亦發布了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季刊及定期更新月刊統計資料，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新及主題性資訊及分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇inSight文章，涵蓋各類具時效性及針對性的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零一四年年報在「非營利機構及慈善機構」類別中獲得銅獎，於香港管理協會二零一五年最佳年報大獎中。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過50,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條所維護的「授權機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊」及「授權機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例所設立的「儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊」。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引導公眾關注有關詐騙電話提防提醒、硬幣收集計劃中的硬幣推車位置等重要及時資訊。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公共教育計畫\n\n位於二號國際金融中心55樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作及推廣公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心由展覽區及圖書館組成，並於週一至週六對公眾開放。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，並提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導覽團。本年資訊中心接待訪客逾四萬八千三百人，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過六百三十場導覽團（圖表3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過五十三萬零四百人造訪資訊中心。\n\n位於展覽區旁的圖書館收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，專門用於深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，維護香港的授權機構電子登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局為持續推展社區接觸計劃，繼續舉辦公開教育講座。2015年，共舉行三場講座，約有2,300名中學學生及教師參與。主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，已有超過54,700人參與。\n\n圖表 3 資訊中心團體訪問類型\n\n年輕的訪客在資訊中心導覽之旅中學習香港貨幣與銀行業的發展。\n\n高中學生與教師參與公共教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培訓及培育一支高度專業的人才隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對工作優先順序的變化。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但其可根據與公務員制度不同的條件僱用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一間公共機構，香港金融管理局旨在維持精簡靈活的結構，並重新配置人力資源以推行新舉措及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年12月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的頒佈，在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立了零售支付監察部，以履行香港金融管理局的新法定職責，包括對儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統的牌照發放及日常監管工作。為加強部門間的協調，重新優化人員資源配置，以應對因實施新舉措而產生的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作負荷與工作複雜性，2015年已計劃進行若干部門的職務重組，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）接掌了執行部門（ENFD）及貨幣處（MMD）的存款保障計劃管理職能與結算功能，並接納銀行部門與銀行業相關的特定工作，包括消費者教育、董事培訓及銀行從業人員能力提升框架等。\n\n外部部門接掌了MMD的市場開發功能，而後者將繼續進行與國庫市場協會及金融指標相關的工作；\n\nENFD 接管了銀行監督處的反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法及反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年成立時共有841個職位，2016年增加34個至875個（增加4%），以確保有足夠資源應對（一）新法例及措施的落實，（二）持續推行經證明屬必要且持續進行的試點計劃，以及（三）現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行與金融穩定，包括以下內容：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、落實國際銀行標準及同儕審查實務；\n\n加強對銀行的流動性風險及網路安全風險管理的監管；\n\n實施關於透過銀行及核准現金經紀商進行場外衍生工具之監督架構，根據新生效之場外衍生工具報告及記錄規則\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作\n\n積極展開規劃及準備工作，以實施金融機構（解決方案）法案，該法案採用國際標準解決金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題。\n\n推動銀行業能力建設，透過為銀行的獨立非執行董事制定董事賦權計劃，以進一步提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，推動銀行從業人員在核心業務領域的增強能力框架。\n\n加強銀行業行為規範政策與研究能力，並在新興銀行、證券及保險產品領域深化相關研究。\n\n加強消費者保護與消費者教育的力度；並\n\n加強對在岸人民幣市場及CNH市場的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金設立相關之擴大投資活動及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並基於日益嚴峻的投資環境，提升戰略資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦予香港金融管理局權力，根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》管理儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n\n臨時人力被調派以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的相關活動或政策倡議。部分員工以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司 (FS) 會根據治理小組 (GSC) 的建議，透過發行基金顧問委員會 (EFAC) 确定香港金融管理局 (HKMA) 員工的薪酬及服務條件，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及職業退休金計劃，實質福利極為有限。總現金薪酬包由每月固定薪金 (或基本薪金) 及變動薪金組成，變動薪金可根據個人表現，每年以一次性發放形式授予員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工的薪酬每年由金融服務局根據GSC透過EFAC所提出的建議進行審查，考慮GSC對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融業薪酬調查結果及其他相關因素。不時會為表現優異的個別員工作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的香港貨幣管理局固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據個人表現發放給各員工。香港貨幣管理局的投資專業人員適用變動薪酬制度，以強化其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。高級總裁或以上職級的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，經財政司根據治理與戰略委員會的建議批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬的會議上並不在場。部門主管或以下職級的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，由香港貨幣管理局總裁根據財政司的授權，在批准的總體薪酬獎勵範圍內作出決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n稽核長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 审計委員會\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司長\n\n本人聲明已審計交易所基金及其子公司（「集團」）所載於第134至222頁之財務報表，該報表包括交易所基金及集團於2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收支帳戶、綜合損益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要及其他說明資訊。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據行政長官根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所作出的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，準備提供真實且公允的財務報表，並負責實施貨幣管理局認為必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表無重大錯報，無論該錯報係出於詐欺或錯誤。\n\n# 審計責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，就這些財務報表表達意見。我是根據首長根據《發鈔基金條例》第7條所作出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計的。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並策劃及執行審計，以獲得合理保證，確保財務報表不存在重大錯誤。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得有關財務報表中金額及披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表存在重大誤報的風險，無論此風險是出於舞弊或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用以表達對實體內部控制有效性意見。審計還包括評估會計政策的適當性以及相關機構所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現。\n\n我認為我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，以提供我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 稽核長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公平地反映截至2015年12月31日交易所基金及其集團之財務狀況，以及該財務表現及現金流於該會計年度之情況，並依照香港財務報告準則編製，且已按照根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所頒佈之行政長官指示適當編製。\n\n大衛孫 總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會\n26樓\n移民塔\n7格洛斯特街\n灣仔, 香港\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入支出表\n綜合收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註\n\n1. 主要業務  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債的類別  \n7. 現金及隨時可用資金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構  \n9. 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可售證券  \n11. 派生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司的權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合營企業的權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 應計資產、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、發行流通的政府發行貨幣紙幣及硬幣  \n21. 銀行業務的資產負債狀況  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構的存放款  \n23. 財政儲備的存放款  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構的存放款  \n25. 發行的發行基金票據及紙幣  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他發行的債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物的分析  \n31. 營運分部資訊  \n32. 抵押資產  \n33. 承諾  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重要關聯交易  \n36. 財務風險管理  \n37. 金融工具的公允價值計量  \n38. 資產負債表後非調整事項  \n39. 2015年12月31日財務年度尚未生效的修訂、新標準及解釋可能的影響  \n40. 財務報表批准\n\n# 交換基金 – 收支帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日的年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 綜合損益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日的年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n錢納姆·T·L·陳\n貨幣管理局\n2016年4月7日\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日的年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日的年度\n\n# 交換基金 – 現金流量表 (續上頁)\n\n截至2015年12月31日的年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（所有金額以千萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n財政司司長委任權下，作為通脹基金（基金）的主管，香港貨幣管理局根據通脹基金條例（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產以四個投資組合進行管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產完全對應香港的貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金帳戶的戰略目的而取得。經營分部資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該詞為統稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要列於下文。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次生效或可供早期採用，適用於當前會計期間。第三項附註提供有關因首次採用這些準則而導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更對集團在本財務報表所載當前及前會計期間的相關影響。\n\n# 交換基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（所有金額以千萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合資企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除外下列資產及負債以公允價值列示，如下列會計政策所述。\n\n交易性金融工具（註2.6.2.1）；以公允價值計量且其變動計入當期損益的金融資產及金融負債（註2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（註2.6.2.5）；黃金（註2.11）；及投資性不動產（註2.12）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，要求管理層作出影響會計政策應用及資產、負債、收入及支出所報告金額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設係基於經驗及其他各項因素，並在特定情況下被認為是合理的，其結果成為評估那些無法從其他來源明顯獲得的資產及負債攜帶價值的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及基本假設會持續審查。會計估計的變更應在該變更所影響的期間內確認，若變更僅影響該期間；或在變更期間及未來期間內確認，若變更同時影響當前及未來期間。\n\n第18項附註包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。第37項附註包含有關金融工具公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。除第2.5項附註所載特定金融工具的評估外，集團會計政策的應用不涉及任何重要會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司係指由集團控制之實體。集團對實體擁有控制權，係指集團因參與該實體而有機會或擁有權利取得變動回報，且具影響該等回報之能力，此能力係基於集團對該實體之控制權。評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮由集團及其他方所持有之實質性權利。\n\n# 交換基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（所有金額以千萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司的投資自取得控制權之日起，直至失去控制權之日止，均併入集團財務報表。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內的帳戶餘額、交易及現金流，以及來自集團內交易的未實現利潤及虧損，均會完全抵銷。\n\n非控制性權益代表子公司中不直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，且集團與這些權益持有人未就任何額外條款達成協議，而這些條款將導致集團整體產生契約義務，該義務符合財務負債的定義。非控制性權益在集團財務報表中於權益項目內列示，與基金所有者權益分開列示。集團的非控制性權益在集團綜合損益表中，以營業利潤或虧損及年度總綜合損益或虧損在非控制性權益與基金所有者之間的分配方式列示。\n\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本計列，減去減值損失（如有）（附註 2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 關聯企業與合資企業\n\n關聯企業是指集團對其管理具有重大影響力，但並無控制或共同控制，透過參與財務及營運政策決策的權力。\n"}
