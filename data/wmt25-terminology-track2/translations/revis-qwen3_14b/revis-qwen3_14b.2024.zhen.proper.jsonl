{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

Throughout the year, regional military conflicts continued, and many countries held important elections, leading to an unclear global economic outlook and ongoing volatility in world affairs. However, policymakers around the world sought an appropriate balance between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth, driving major economies toward steady expansion. Additionally, with the US initiating its first interest rate cuts in four years, coupled with a series of supportive economic policies introduced in mainland China, market sentiment turned more optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains full of uncertainties.\n\nFaced with complex circumstances, our response strategy is to continue fully leveraging Hong Kong's role as a hub and its unique advantages in offshore renminbi business, fintech, and green and sustainable finance, to continuously consolidate Hong Kong's leading position as an international financial center. In 2024, the HKMA made significant progress in these key areas. Events and initiatives such as the annual Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit were well received, fully demonstrating the international community's firm confidence in Hong Kong's prospects as an international financial center.\n\nFacing Hong Kong's cyclical adjustments and structural transformation, we have closely collaborated with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviating their repayment burdens in a high-interest rate environment while helping them sustain development. Combined with the various policy measures introduced by the Central Government and the HKSAR Government, Hong Kong's economy has steadily recovered. In 2024, Hong Kong's economy recorded a moderate growth of 2.5%.\n\nAs 2025 begins, the global economy continues to face numerous uncertainties amid an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. The rise of protectionist trade policies and increased tariff barriers will lead to disruptions in global supply chains, intensify geo-economic fragmentation, and add more variables to the global economic outlook. If geopolitical tensions escalate further, it could lead to a dual impact on the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFaced with a complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant and diligently fulfill our responsibilities to strive to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, and continue to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. We will deepen our engagement with various market sectors, actively promote the development of emerging areas, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains its leading advantage in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: A Steady Foundation\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all highly accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" as required by the dictionary, and they all convey the core message of the original text: the LERS has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong's stability for over 40 years, successfully withstanding various economic and interest rate cycles and demonstrating resilience.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the term \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Proper use of grammar and sentence structure in English.\n- Natural and fluent phrasing that reads well in English.\n- Consistent use of key terms such as \"cornerstone,\" \"withstanding,\" and \"resilience.\"\nWeaknesses are minimal and mostly stylistic:\n- Some translations use \"multiple\" while others use \"numerous\" to describe the number of economic and interest rate cycles. Both are correct, but \"numerous\" may sound slightly more formal or precise in this context.\n- A few translations use \"challenges from multiple economic and interest rate cycles\" (Translation 6), which is slightly wordier than necessary and less direct than \"withstanding multiple economic and interest rate cycles.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and fluency of the original translations while using the most natural and precise phrasing. \"Numerous\" may be slightly more appropriate than \"multiple\" in this context, and the phrase \"successfully withstanding\" is more direct and commonly used in formal writing than \"successfully weathering\" or \"successfully withstanding challenges from.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for over 40 years, successfully withstanding numerous economic and interest rate cycles and demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rate policy in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar currency markets continued to operate smoothly under the LERS mechanism. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, initially weakening slightly in the first four months of the year due to reduced liquidity, before gradually strengthening and approaching the upper limit of the Convertibility Undertakings by year-end. The stable exchange rate fully reflects the market's confidence in the LERS. At the same time, the LERS continues to receive high recognition from the IMF and the international financial community.\n\nConfidence in the LERS is built on our ongoing proactive efforts to explain to the public the operational mechanisms and advantages of the LERS, as well as rigorous market surveillance. By collecting detailed data and combining it with advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies, we conduct more timely and comprehensive market surveillance and financial stability assessments.\n\n# Banking Sector: Remaining Resilient Amid Multiple Challenges\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong banking sector demonstrated strong resilience amid multiple macroeconomic challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining ample. By the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also ample, with the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, surpassing the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. Due to persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt issues in some mainland Chinese property developers, and a weak local commercial real estate market, the classified loan ratio rose to 1.96% by year-end. Thanks to banks' adherence to prudent credit risk management and maintenance of adequate provisions, the related risks remain overall manageable.\n\nWhile all six translations are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"have both returned to the levels prior to the implementation\" is slightly redundant, as \"returned\" and \"prior to the implementation\" are both clear.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with minor variations in phrasing. The use of \"reverted to the levels before the implementation\" is slightly more formal and precise. The term \"banking sector\" is used, which is acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. The phrase \"have been reverted to the levels prior to the implementation\" is slightly awkward due to the passive voice and the use of \"reverted\" with \"have been.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is the most fluent and natural of the translations. It uses \"reverted to the levels prior to the implementation\" effectively and includes the full form \"debt servicing ratio (DSR) limits,\" which is more precise and informative.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is accurate but slightly more verbose. The phrase \"have both been restored to the levels prevailing before the implementation\" is slightly wordy and less direct than \"reverted to the levels prior to the implementation.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and concise. The use of \"upper limit of the debt servicing ratio (DSR)\" is precise and aligns with the dictionary. However, the phrase \"reverted to the levels prior to the implementation\" is slightly less natural than \"reverted to the levels before the implementation.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"reverted to the levels prior to the implementation\" is more natural and commonly used in formal writing than \"returned to the levels prior to the implementation.\"\n- Including the full form \"(DSR)\" after \"debt servicing ratio\" adds clarity and is more informative.\n- Using \"banking sector\" is acceptable, but \"banking system\" is also valid and may be more precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"in response to changes in the property market and related risks in the banking sector\" is concise and clear.\n**Improved Translation**:\nWhile continuing to closely monitor bank credit risks, including those related to property mortgage loans, the HKMA implemented two rounds of adjustments to countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans in 2024, in response to changes in the property market and related risks in the banking system. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limits for all residential properties have reverted to the levels prior to the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile all six translations are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"risk management,\" \"CrowdStrike incident,\" \"third-party service providers,\" \"operational resilience framework(s),\" and \"mapping and scenario testing exercises.\"\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n- Each version captures the key points: the need to strengthen risk management, the importance of operational resilience, the example of the CrowdStrike incident, and the current progress of Hong Kong banks.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"operational resilience frameworks\" (plural) in the first instance, but later uses \"operational resilience framework\" (singular) when referring to the structure banks should establish. This inconsistency should be resolved.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"operational resilience frameworks\" consistently and includes \"arising from\" which is slightly more formal and precise than \"brought by.\"\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the best version but uses \"severe scenarios\" instead of \"severe situations,\" which is slightly less natural.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"operational resilience of banking operations and technology\" instead of \"operational and technological resilience of banks,\" which slightly alters the emphasis.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"operation of critical businesses\" instead of \"continuity of critical operations,\" which is less standard in this context.\n- **Translation 6** is very strong, using \"continued operation of critical business functions,\" which is precise and natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best version should:\n- Use \"operational resilience frameworks\" consistently.\n- Use \"arising from\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"critical operations\" rather than \"critical business operations\" or \"critical business functions\" for consistency with the original.\n- Use \"mapping and scenario testing exercises\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Maintain a natural, professional tone without unnecessary repetition or awkward phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is as follows:\nWhile continuously strengthening bank credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological resilience of banks to address new challenges arising from increasing reliance on third-party service providers. Taking the CrowdStrike incident in July last year as an example, this incident highlighted the potential for cascading severe consequences in today's highly interconnected global environment. Although the incident had limited impact on Hong Kong's banking sector, it underscored the need to ensure that banks establish robust operational resilience frameworks to maintain critical operations even in severe situations. Encouragingly, all Hong Kong banks have now established operational resilience frameworks and have entered an important phase of mapping and scenario testing exercises, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities to ensure the continuity of critical operations.\n\nAt the same time, to address evolving cyber threats, the HKMA focused last year on strengthening the banking sector's cyber resilience, including issuing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulators to advance the cross-industry \"Cyber Mapping\" exercise, assessing and addressing systemic cyber risks that may arise from the interconnections among financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and technology service providers. Following the completion of the trial in 2024, the project will be fully launched this year.\n\nAnother major challenge brought about by technological development is the escalating threat of financial fraud and scams, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and require joint efforts from banks, regulators, law-enforcement bodies, and the public to address. We have already asked banks to further strengthen their internet banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) also expanded its coverage to include all major retail banks and six Stored Value Facility licensees, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of information exchange, and leading to an increase in the seizure of criminal proceeds. At the same time, the legislative amendments consultation on promoting bank-to-bank information sharing has received widespread support, and this legislation will help further enhance banks' ability to detect and prevent financial crime.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures, raising public awareness of suspicious transactions and enhancing self-protection awareness is equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and launched the \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,\" introducing more participating institutions to broaden the protective network of the charter and further safeguard the public. At the same time, we also introduced the \"Money Safe\" service, allowing bank customers to choose to segregate part of their deposits for additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures to help customers prevent fraud, we also addressed the risk of individual customers potentially overborrowing impulsively. Last year, we required retail banks to provide a seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully reconsider and assess their financial responsibilities and repayment capabilities after entering into a loan agreement. Meanwhile, the \"Credit Data Smart\" personal data infrastructure project was successfully launched last year, marking significant progress in enhancing consumer credit reference services.\n\nIn addition to our regulatory work, another key focus for 2024 is ensuring credit supply to support the real economy, which is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a vital pillar of Hong Kong's economy. Last year, we jointly launched the ‘9+5’ support measures with the banking sector to help SMEs obtain bank financing to meet their working capital needs and support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have committed not to require mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to prepay their loans, nor to reduce credit limits solely based on a decline in collateral value. To date, over 39,000 SMEs have received credit reliefs and new loan approvals, involving a total credit facility of HK$95 billion. Banks have also set aside approximately HK$390 billion in dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support SMEs in sustaining their development amid changing market conditions. Furthermore, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks jointly established the Taskforce on SME Lending to provide support to SMEs from both individual cases and industry-wide perspectives. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic outlook, we introduced three additional sector-specific measures in April 2025 to further strengthen support for SMEs across multiple industries. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nIn maintaining banking stability and enhancing operational efficiency, we continue to promote the application of technology in the banking sector and strive to accelerate the adoption of fintech. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have integrated fintech into their daily operations. Furthermore, given the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening risk management, preventing fraud, and improving customer experience, the HKMA and Cyberport launched the \"GenAI Sandbox\" last year to encourage banks to apply GenAI responsibly. We have also issued guidelines to banks, clearly stipulating that if banks use GenAI in customer-facing applications, they must ensure customers receive adequate protection. In addition, the HKMA is actively utilizing GenAI technology internally to enhance analytical and regulatory efficiency. Apart from GenAI, we are also promoting connections between financial services and the technology sector through the launch of the new FiNETech series, the establishment of a matching platform called \"Fintech Connect,\" and a series of cross-industry exchange events, fostering collaboration and innovation in the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# Consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties of 2024, Hong Kong has maintained its leading position as an international financial center and continues to expand and enhance its influence in multiple areas on the global stage.\n\nHong Kong plays an unparalleled and unique role as a vital bridge connecting mainland China with international markets. By introducing various favorable measures and strengthening collaboration with all parties, Hong Kong continues to consolidate and enhance its position as a regional hub for fintech innovation and sustainable finance. For details regarding our work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# Rapid Growth in RMB Business Deepens Financial Cooperation with the Mainland\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's RMB business continued to maintain strong momentum, with significant growth recorded in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly offshore bank lending. The RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement system reached a new historical high in daily transaction volume, amounting to 3.1 trillion RMB, reflecting Hong Kong's increasingly prominent role as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen the financial interconnectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland. The \"Three Links and Three Facilitations\" policy introduced in 2024, combined with six new measures announced at the beginning of this year, have achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the HKMA launched an RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility of RMB 100 billion, providing banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funding to expand RMB trade finance services and thereby support the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through the Northbound Bond Connect, particularly those issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks, as eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility, OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited, and the offshore RMB bond repo business. This innovative move enhances the appeal of onshore bonds to offshore investors, helping to encourage greater participation by global investors in onshore bond markets. We also launched WMC 2.0 last year, achieving multi-faceted upgrades, including offering a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and promotion arrangements, and expanding individual investment quotas. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub but also further strengthen our role as an important gateway connecting the mainland with international markets.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management 321"],"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports amid improved external demand and the recovery of the global tech cycle. The labour market remained robust, while inflation stayed moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. The local stock market showed a significant rebound, whereas the property market remained largely weak due to sustained high interest rates dampening market sentiment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, Mainland's proactive economic stimulus measures, combined with multifaceted support for local businesses, should help reinforce business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional ties.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound, with ample capital and liquidity, and overall asset quality remains manageable.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding US monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and currency markets have continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened in the first four months of 2024 but turned stronger for the remainder of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in structure and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in tone, flow, and precision that can be refined for optimal clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"small and medium-sized enterprises,\" \"risk-based supervision,\" \"contingency planning,\" \"Banking Stability,\" \"operational resilience,\" \"cyber resilience,\" \"supervisory guidance,\" \"cross-sectoral initiatives,\" and \"Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, and the meaning is preserved accurately.\n- The use of \"fintech innovation\" in translations 5 and 6 is a slight but meaningful enhancement, as it adds specificity to the term \"fintech.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Banking Stability\" with a capital \"B,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry and may appear overly formal or incorrect in standard English usage.\n- The use of \"thereby\" in translations 1, 3, and 5 is slightly redundant and can be omitted for a more concise and natural flow.\n- The phrase \"has launched\" in translation 4 introduces a present perfect tense that is not necessary and slightly disrupts the consistent past tense used in the rest of the text.\n- The use of \"support to the industry\" in translation 5 is slightly awkward compared to \"support for the industry\" or \"supporting the industry.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistent capitalization for terms like \"Banking Stability\" as per the dictionary, but ensure it is lowercase unless it is a proper noun or title.\n- Use \"fintech innovation\" instead of \"fintech\" when the context refers to the broader application or development of fintech.\n- Opt for a more concise structure by removing redundant words like \"thereby\" and ensuring tense consistency.\n- Use \"support for the industry\" or \"supporting the industry\" for smoother phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and safeguard Banking Stability through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided supervisory guidance and support for the industry to address emerging risks, enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage fintech innovation, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sectoral initiatives, including the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,\" \"Money Safe,\" \"cooling-off period,\" \"generative artificial intelligence,\" \"customer-facing applications,\" \"Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions,\" \"digital asset-related activities,\" \"consumer credit reference services,\" \"Credit Data Smart,\" and \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory announcements.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"has launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0, Money Safe, and a cooling-off period for bank unsecured consumer credit products to strengthen bank consumer protection.\" This sentence is grammatically correct but could be more fluid.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"The HKMA has introduced... In addition, the HKMA has provided...\" which can be streamlined.\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"Digital Bank\" with a capital \"D\" while others use \"digital banks\" with a lowercase \"d.\" The dictionary lists both, but consistency is important for clarity.\n- **Clarity of \"secondary market\":** Some translations use \"secondary market transactions\" while others use \"secondary market property transactions.\" The original text refers to \"二手物業買賣交易,\" which is \"secondary market property transactions,\" so the more specific term is preferable.\n- **\"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\":** Some translations use \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme\" or \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" but the dictionary lists multiple options. The most concise and commonly used term is \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"digital banks\" (lowercase) or \"Digital Bank\" (capitalized) based on context.\n- Ensure clarity by using the most specific terms, such as \"secondary market property transactions\" instead of \"secondary market transactions.\"\n- Improve sentence flow by avoiding repetitive structures and using more natural phrasing.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly and consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has introduced the \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,\" \"Money Safe,\" and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, to strengthen bank consumer protection. In addition, the HKMA has provided guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing applications, and has worked closely with the industry to introduce an additional payment arrangement for secondary market property transactions. The HKMA has also issued guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimized the pilot program for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, relaxed several restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of consumer credit reference services to \"Credit Data Smart.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, though some variations exist. For example, \"可疑帳號警示\" is translated as \"Suspicious Account Alert\" in most translations, which is the preferred term from the dictionary. However, \"pre-transaction alerts\" is also listed, and while it may be contextually appropriate, \"Suspicious Account Alert\" is more precise and directly reflects the original term.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some minor grammatical issues exist. For instance, \"the number of suspicious transaction reporting\" (first translation) is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"the number of suspicious transaction reports.\" Similarly, \"financial crimes\" (fourth translation) is plural, but the original text uses \"financial crime,\" which is singular and more consistent with the context.\n3. **Vocabulary and Style**: The use of \"vital\" (third and sixth translations) is slightly more emphatic than \"important\" and may be more appropriate depending on the tone desired. However, \"important\" is more neutral and widely used in official contexts, which may be preferable here.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use formal and professional language suitable for a regulatory body like the HKMA.\n5. **Consistency**: The third and sixth translations are the most consistent in terms of structure and use of dictionary terms. They also use \"financial crime\" (singular) and \"Suspicious Account Alert\" as specified in the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA plays an important role in Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counterfinancing of terrorism regime. Through enhanced information exchange and cooperation via the public-private partnership platform, the number of suspicious transaction reports has significantly increased, thereby enabling more effective seizure of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legislative amendments to promote bank-to-bank information sharing has received widespread support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crime. In addition, the HKMA has issued guidelines to banks on the application of artificial intelligence for suspicious activity monitoring, as well as measures to prevent and counter authorized payment scams, and has optimized the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"capital adequacy,\" \"international supervisory standards,\" and \"Deposit Protection Scheme.\" The only variation is in the use of \"several aspects,\" \"several areas,\" \"multiple areas,\" and \"multiple areas of Hong Kong's,\" which are all acceptable, though \"several aspects\" is slightly more natural in this context.\nThe first translation is slightly more varied in structure, placing \"in Hong Kong\" after \"international supervisory standards,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the others. The sixth translation uses \"Furthermore\" instead of \"In addition,\" which is a stylistic choice but still appropriate.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth translations include \"Hong Kong\" before \"Deposit Protection Scheme,\" which is redundant since the scheme is specific to Hong Kong and is already referred to as \"the Deposit Protection Scheme\" in the dictionary. This redundancy can be omitted for conciseness.\nThe best possible translation would retain the clarity and conciseness of the second translation while avoiding redundancy and using natural phrasing.\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure, in Hong Kong. In addition, several aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme have been optimized to enhance protection for depositors.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"resolution regime,\" \"resolution standards,\" \"financial contracts,\" \"resolvability barriers,\" \"preferred resolution strategies,\" and \"resolution execution capabilities.\" However, there are subtle variations in sentence structure and word choice that affect fluency and clarity.\nTranslation 1 is well-structured and uses \"its work\" to maintain subject consistency. It also uses \"reduce the risk of disorderly early termination,\" which is clear and natural.\nTranslation 2 uses \"Resolution regime\" with a capital \"R,\" which may be inconsistent with the lowercase usage in other translations. It also uses \"mitigate\" instead of \"reduce,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\nTranslation 3 is nearly identical to Translation 1, with only minor differences in prepositions and phrasing.\nTranslation 4 uses a more fragmented structure with \"requiring banks to update financial contracts with counterparties, and reducing the risk...\" This structure is less fluid compared to the others.\nTranslation 5 uses \"that require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties, thereby reducing the risk...\" This is a more complex sentence structure but still clear and grammatically sound.\nTranslation 6 is similar to Translation 5 but uses \"financial contracts\" without \"their,\" which is slightly less precise but still acceptable.\nConsidering fluency, clarity, and grammatical correctness, the best approach would be to combine the strengths of the most fluid translations while ensuring consistency in terminology and sentence structure.\nThe best possible translation would maintain the subject \"HKMA\" with \"its work\" for consistency, use \"reduce\" rather than \"mitigate\" for simplicity, and ensure that the sentence structure is clear and natural.\nThe final translation should also ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly and that the overall message is conveyed with clarity and precision.\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work to ensure the credibility of the resolution regime, implementing resolution standards that require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties, thereby reducing the risk of disorderly early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing resolvability barriers, and enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" and use the term \"offshore renminbi business hub\" or its variants for \"離岸人民幣業務樞紐.\"\n- Most translations use \"eligible collateral\" for \"合資格抵押品\" and \"RMB Liquidity Facility\" for \"人民幣流動資金安排.\"\n- The term \"北向互換通\" is translated as either \"Northbound Swap Connect\" or \"Northbound Trading of Swap Connect,\" with the former being more concise and commonly used.\n- \"跨境理財通\" is translated as \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" or \"Wealth Management Connect,\" with the longer version being more precise.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"mainland China\" inconsistently, sometimes using \"Mainland\" and sometimes \"mainland,\" which should be standardized.\n- The phrase \"mutual access\" in Translation 6 is not an accurate translation of \"互聯互通,\" which is better rendered as \"connectivity\" or \"interconnectivity.\"\n- Translation 4 uses \"Wealth Management Connect\" without the \"Cross-boundary\" qualifier, which may be less precise than the full term.\n- Some translations use \"reinforce\" or \"consolidate\" interchangeably, but \"consolidate\" is more appropriate for \"鞏固.\"\n- Translation 1 and 3 use \"help reinforce\" and \"help strengthen,\" which are slightly less formal than \"will help strengthen\" or \"will help consolidate.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent terminology, especially for the named financial instruments.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for official statements.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n- Adhere strictly to the dictionary terms provided.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various versions while ensuring consistency and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, in cooperation with relevant authorities in the Mainland and Hong Kong, has launched a series of measures to jointly deepen and expand the interconnectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets, including optimizing the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect; expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect transactions; and optimizing the Northbound Swap Connect. These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong’s gateway role and consolidate its position as a global offshore renminbi (RMB) business hub.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"market outreach,\" \"financial services,\" \"HKMA,\" and others, as required. However, there are subtle variations in tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure that mirrors the original Chinese.\n- Proper use of grammar and vocabulary in most cases.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Some translations use \"significant progress\" instead of \"good progress,\" which may not align with the original tone.\n- Variations in phrasing such as \"helping them fully understand\" vs. \"enabling them to fully recognize\" or \"ensuring they fully understand\" affect the tone and clarity.\n- The use of \"resilience\" vs. \"stability\" for \"穩健\" may be contextually appropriate, but \"stability\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"financial center\" instead of \"financial centre,\" which is a minor but notable difference in British vs. American English.\n- The phrase \"creating a positive ripple effect\" is used in some translations, while others use \"generating positive ripple effects,\" which is slightly more natural.\nImprovements could include:\n- Maintaining consistency in the use of \"financial centre\" or \"financial center\" based on the target audience.\n- Using \"stability\" rather than \"resilience\" for \"穩健\" to align with standard financial terminology.\n- Ensuring that the verb used to describe the effect of the summit (e.g., \"create,\" \"generate,\" \"produce\") is consistent and natural.\n- Using \"enhance\" or \"strengthen\" consistently for \"提升\" or \"加強.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the original tone, use \"stability\" for \"穩健,\" and ensure consistency in phrasing and terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach to overseas and mainland stakeholders, enabling them to fully understand the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" and several other major events were successfully held, not only enhancing Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also creating a positive ripple effect. In addition, the HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting the development of financial markets.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Fintech 2025,\" \"Central Bank Digital Currencies,\" \"Faster Payment System (FPS),\" \"Internet Banking Payment System,\" and \"cross-boundary payments.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- The use of terms like \"interconnection,\" \"interoperability,\" and \"facilitating\" is appropriate in the context of financial systems.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"various aspects\" while others use \"various areas\" or \"across various areas.\" While all are acceptable, \"across various areas\" is more natural in formal writing.\n- **Redundancy and clarity:** The phrase \"to promote the implementation of the connection\" in some translations is slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing like \"to advance the interconnection\" is preferable.\n- **Use of \"Mainland\" vs. \"mainland China\":** Some translations use \"Mainland\" without the article, which is less formal. \"Mainland China\" is more standard in formal writing.\n- **Abbreviations:** While \"FPS\" and \"CBDCs\" are acceptable, they should be introduced with their full forms on first mention unless the context clearly implies them.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"across various areas\" for a more natural flow.\n- Replace \"to promote the implementation of the connection\" with \"to advance the interconnection\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"Mainland China\" consistently for clarity and formality.\n- Introduce abbreviations like \"FPS\" and \"CBDCs\" with their full forms on first mention.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe HKMA has made significant progress across various areas of its \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the HKMA is closely cooperating with the People’s Bank of China to advance the interconnection between Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS) and the Internet Banking Payment System in Mainland China, facilitating cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nIn 2024, global financial markets performed generally well, with major economies recording stable growth and major central banks gradually lowering policy rates as inflation eased. Against this backdrop, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return of 5.2%.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"asset diversification,\" \"responsible investment\/investing,\" \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" and \"annualised internal rate of return.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, formality, and sentence structure that can be refined for optimal clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Accurate conveyance of the core message.\n- Generally fluent and grammatically correct English.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The phrase \"strive to promote\" (used in translations 1 and 6) is slightly more formal and less direct than \"continue to promote\" (used in translations 5 and 6), which is more concise and natural in this context.\n- \"Responsible investment\" (used in translations 1, 3, and 6) and \"responsible investing\" (used in translations 2 and 4) are both acceptable, but \"responsible investing\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"since its investment commencement in 2009\" (translation 1) and \"since the commencement of investment in 2009\" (translation 4) are slightly awkward. A smoother alternative would be \"since its investments began in 2009\" or \"since 2009.\"\n- The use of \"At the same time\" (translations 3 and 5) is slightly less formal than \"Meanwhile,\" which is more commonly used in such contexts.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"responsible investing\" (as it is more standard in financial contexts), \"continue to promote\" (for conciseness and naturalness), and \"since its investments began in 2009\" (for clarity and fluency).\nThe HKMA continues to promote asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its investments began in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to maintain close communication with society and the market in order to improve public understanding of its policies and work. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" as the translation for \"金管局\" from the dictionary.\n- The structure \"maintains close contact with society and the market through various channels\" is consistent across translations and accurately reflects the original.\n- The use of \"enhance public understanding of its policies and work\" is accurate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the public's understanding,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"public understanding.\"\n- The second translation uses \"operations\" instead of \"work,\" which is a slight deviation from the original term \"工作\" (work), though \"operations\" is not incorrect.\n- The third translation uses \"community\" instead of \"society,\" which is a minor but meaningful shift in meaning. \"Community\" implies a more localized or specific group, whereas \"society\" is broader.\n- The fourth translation omits the article \"the\" before \"public understanding,\" which is acceptable in informal contexts but less formal in a professional setting.\n- The fifth translation uses \"communication\" instead of \"contact,\" which is a more precise term in this context and adds a slight nuance of ongoing dialogue.\n- The sixth translation is very close to the original, using \"the public's understanding\" and \"the HKMA's policies and work,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more wordy than necessary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and natural in English. It should use \"public understanding\" without the possessive form for conciseness, and \"communication\" may be more appropriate than \"contact\" to reflect the active exchange of information. \"Society\" is more accurate than \"community\" in this context. The use of \"work\" is more direct than \"operations\" and better reflects the original term.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains close communication with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible, adaptive, and professional work team while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

Hong Kong and Macao, the HKMA’s Central Moneymarkets Unit has established a direct link with the Macao Central Securities Depository and Clearing Limited under the Monetary Authority of Macao.\n\n# October 25th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"10月25日,\" which translates to \"October 25th\" in English. The dictionary provided is empty, so there are no specific terms that require exact translation. The junior translators have all provided variations of \"October 25th\" or \"October 25,\" with slight differences in formatting.\nThe first junior translator used \"October 25th,\" which is the most natural and commonly accepted format for dates in English. The second junior translator used \"October 25,\" which is also correct but lacks the \"th\" ordinal indicator, which is often included in formal or written contexts. The third through sixth junior translators all used \"October 25th,\" which is consistent and appropriate.\nThe best possible translation would be \"October 25th,\" as it is the most complete and natural representation of the date in English, adhering to standard formatting conventions.\n\nThe HKMA has increased the number of Primary Liquidity Providers in the offshore renminbi market to 11 banks and raised the total amount of renminbi liquidity available under the PLP Scheme from 180 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan.\n\n# banking sector\n\n# February 7th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that warrant a critical review.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"anti-money laundering and counterfinancing of terrorism\" for \"打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集.\"\n- The phrase \"detailing how to strengthen and modernize anti-money laundering supervision\" is consistently used, which is accurate for \"詳述如何加強和現代化反洗錢監管.\"\n- The titles of the report are all close to the original, with minor variations in wording such as \"Digitalization Process,\" \"Digitalisation Progress,\" and \"Digitization Process.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** The term \"反洗錢監管\" is translated as \"anti-money laundering supervision\" in all translations, which is correct. However, the term \"監管\" in the title \"打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監管的數碼化進程\" is translated inconsistently as \"regulation,\" \"supervision,\" or \"supervision.\" The most appropriate term in this context is \"regulation\" since it refers to the regulatory framework, not just oversight.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"Digitalisation\" (British English) while others use \"Digitalization\" (American English). Given the context and the likely audience, \"Digitalization\" is more neutral and widely accepted.\n- **Title Accuracy:** The original title is \"打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監管的數碼化進程：現況及前瞻.\" The most accurate translation would be \"Digitalization Process of Anti-Money Laundering and Counterfinancing of Terrorism Regulation: Current Status and Prospects.\" The use of \"Regulation\" instead of \"Supervision\" better reflects the formal regulatory framework being digitized.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Digitalization\" instead of \"Digitalisation\" for consistency with American English and broader international usage.\n- Use \"Regulation\" instead of \"Supervision\" in the title to accurately reflect the formal regulatory framework.\n- Ensure the title includes \"Prospects\" instead of \"Outlook\" or \"Future Outlook\" for closer alignment with the original term \"前瞻.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA published the report \"Digitalization Process of Anti-Money Laundering and Counterfinancing of Terrorism Regulation: Current Status and Prospects,\" detailing how to strengthen and modernize anti-money laundering supervision.\n\n# February 20\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of regulatory announcements. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in word choice and structure that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"tokenised products,\" and \"digital asset custodial services.\"\n- The use of \"notices\" or \"circulars\" is appropriate, though \"circulars\" may be more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- The structure \"providing guidance on...\" is accurate and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"respectively\" correctly but places it awkwardly: \"respectively providing guidance on the sale and distribution of tokenised products and the provision of digital asset custodial services.\" This could be smoother.\n- The second and fifth translations use \"circulars\" consistently, which is a good choice for formal regulatory communications.\n- The third translation uses \"on offering\" instead of \"on the provision of,\" which is slightly less formal and less precise.\n- The fourth translation is very close to the best version but places \"respectively\" in a slightly awkward position.\n- The sixth translation places \"respectively\" correctly, but the use of \"circulars\" may be more appropriate than \"notices\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Circulars\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts than \"notices,\" especially when referring to formal guidance issued by authorities like the HKMA.\n- The placement of \"respectively\" should be after the verb \"providing\" to clearly indicate that each notice corresponds to one of the two areas of guidance.\n- The phrase \"the provision of\" is more formal and precise than \"offering\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued two circulars to banks, providing guidance respectively on the sale and distribution of tokenised products and on the provision of digital asset custodial services.\n\n# February 28\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"countercyclical macroprudential measures,\" \"maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios,\" and \"interest rate stress testing requirement.\"\n- Most translations maintain the structure of the original text, listing the four main revisions clearly.\n- The use of \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratios\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical Errors:** Several translations incorrectly use \"HKD 30 million\" and \"HKD 35 million\" instead of the correct \"HKD 3 million\" and \"HKD 3.5 million.\" This is a critical error that could mislead readers.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios\" unnecessarily, which affects fluency.\n- **Clarity of \"non-self-use residential properties\":** While the dictionary provides \"non-self-use residential properties,\" some translations use \"non-self-occupied residential properties,\" which is not an exact match and may confuse readers.\n- **Use of \"raising\" vs. \"increasing\":** While both are acceptable, \"increasing\" is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts and is more neutral in tone.\n- **Punctuation and Formatting:** Some translations use inconsistent punctuation, such as missing commas after introductory clauses or inconsistent use of semicolons and parentheses.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Correct the numerical values to \"HKD 3 million\" and \"HKD 3.5 million\" as per the original text.\n- Use \"increasing\" instead of \"raising\" for consistency with formal regulatory language.\n- Ensure that \"non-self-use residential properties\" is used exactly as in the dictionary.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"maximum LTV ratios\" once per clause, unless necessary for clarity.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"based on the net worth of mortgage applicants\" is used consistently and accurately.\n- Maintain clarity and fluency by using appropriate punctuation and sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued guidelines to banks to adjust countercyclical macroprudential measures and other related regulatory requirements applicable to property mortgage loans. The main revisions include: (1) increasing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for self-occupied residential properties valued at HKD 3 million or below to 70%, for self-occupied residential properties valued at HKD 3.5 million or above to 60%, and for non-self-use residential properties to 60%; (2) increasing the maximum LTV ratios for non-residential properties to 70%; (3) increasing the maximum LTV ratios for property mortgage loans based on the net worth of mortgage applicants to 60%; and (4) suspending the interest rate stress testing requirement for property mortgage loans assuming a 200 basis point increase in interest rates.\n\n# February 28\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward announcement regarding the extension of application periods for two specific products under a government scheme. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, punctuation, and clarity that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"80% Guarantee Product,\" \"90% Guarantee Product,\" and \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, with only minor variations in prepositions and punctuation.\n- The use of \"extended to the end of March 2026\" or \"March 31, 2026\" is appropriate, though the former is more natural in formal announcements.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The fifth translation incorrectly places \"including 80% Guarantee Product and 90% Guarantee Product\" as if they are part of the scheme itself, which misrepresents the relationship between the scheme and the products.\n- The first and sixth translations use quotation marks consistently, while others use single or mixed quotation marks, which is stylistically inconsistent.\n- The second and fourth translations use \"March 31, 2026,\" which is precise but slightly more formal than \"the end of March 2026,\" which is commonly used in official announcements.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain the use of \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" as the full name, with \"SFGS\" as an optional abbreviation in parentheses if needed, though the original text does not include it.\n- Use consistent quotation marks (either double or single) throughout the sentence.\n- Use \"the end of March 2026\" for a more natural and commonly used phrasing in official contexts.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe application period for the \"80% Guarantee Product\" and \"90% Guarantee Product\" under the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has been extended to the end of March 2026.\n\n# March 28\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. It uses \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" consistently and correctly. However, the phrase \"assist them in sustaining development\" is slightly awkward compared to \"assist them in sustaining their development.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"sustaining their operations\" instead of \"sustaining development,\" which is more natural in this context. It also uses \"unable to make timely payments\" and \"prepay their loans in advance,\" which are more precise than some other versions.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"SMEs\" and \"interest and fee reductions,\" which are acceptable. However, the phrase \"repay their loans in advance on schedule\" is confusing and grammatically awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version incorrectly states \"mortgage customers who make payments on time to prepay,\" which contradicts the original meaning. It also uses \"assisting their continued development,\" which is less natural than \"assist them in continued development.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"accessing bank financing\" and \"making timely repayments,\" which are natural and precise. It also uses \"fee reductions\" and \"SME customers in need,\" which are appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version uses \"making timely contributions\" instead of \"making timely payments,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"credit facilities\" and \"concessions,\" which are acceptable but slightly less common than \"credit limits\" and \"waivers.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"HKMA\" should be used consistently.\n- \"Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism\" should be used as per the dictionary.\n- \"SMEs\" is more concise and commonly used in formal contexts.\n- \"Sustaining their operations\" is more natural than \"sustaining development.\"\n- \"Prepay their loans in advance\" is more precise than \"repay their loans in advance on schedule.\"\n- \"Interest and fee waivers\" is more precise than \"reductions\" or \"concessions.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA, in collaboration with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism, has introduced nine measures to support SMEs in accessing bank financing and assist them in sustaining their operations. These include not requiring mortgage customers who are unable to make timely payments to prepay their loans in advance; adjusting credit limits to provide customers with a minimum of six months' transition period; and actively considering offering interest and fee waivers for SMEs in need.\n\n# April 1st\n\nIntroducing a 1% positive neutral countercyclical capital buffer.\n\n# April 10th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section marker. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning of the date, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations correctly use \"April 10th\" or \"April 10\" with appropriate ordinal formatting. However, the fifth translation omits the \"th\" in \"10th,\" which is less formal and may be less appropriate in contexts requiring full date formatting. The third and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the \"#\" is intended to denote a section or heading, but it is not clear from the original text whether this is necessary.\nThe best translation would be \"April 10th,\" as it is the most standard and formal way to write the date in English, and it avoids unnecessary symbols unless explicitly required by context. Since the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it may be appropriate to retain it if it serves a specific formatting purpose, but in the absence of further context, the most neutral and standard translation is \"April 10th.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,\" \"digital fraud,\" \"scams,\" \"merchant institutions,\" and \"financial regulators.\" However, some translations use \"merchants\" instead of \"merchant institutions,\" which is less precise and not aligned with the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first, second, third, and sixth translations are grammatically sound and fluent. The fourth and fifth translations have minor issues, such as \"the charter’s coverage and further assisting\" (awkward phrasing) and \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0 has received full support\" (repetition of the title).\n3. **Consistency in Terminology**: The use of \"merchant institutions\" is more precise than \"merchants\" or \"merchant institutions from various industries.\" The term \"merchant institutions\" should be consistently used as per the dictionary.\n4. **Punctuation and Style**: Some translations use semicolons and commas inconsistently. For example, the second translation uses a semicolon correctly, while the fifth translation uses a comma after \"related organizations,\" which is less formal and less preferred in such contexts.\n5. **Verb Tense and Style**: The first, second, and sixth translations use the present perfect tense (\"have launched,\" \"have received\"), which is appropriate for recent actions. The third and fourth translations use the simple past tense (\"launched,\" \"received\"), which is also acceptable but slightly less formal.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) have launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0, expanding the scope of the Charter to further assist the public in preventing credit card scams and other forms of digital fraud. The Charter 2.0 has received full support from multiple government departments, financial regulators, and relevant organizations; over 230 financial institutions and merchant institutions from various industries have participated.\n\n# April 26\n# 4月26日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, typically appearing in calendars, headlines, or as a section heading. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in formatting and style that may affect the appropriateness of the translation depending on the context.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations simply use \"April 26,\" which is a standard and widely accepted format in English for dates. It is concise and appropriate for most general contexts.\nThe second and fifth translations include the \"#\" symbol before the date, which may be appropriate if the original text was used as a heading or section title in a document or webpage. However, the \"#\" symbol is not part of the original Chinese text, so its inclusion may be an unnecessary addition unless the context specifically requires it.\nThe fourth and sixth translations use \"April 26th,\" which is also grammatically correct but slightly more formal and less commonly used in modern English writing, especially in headlines or informal contexts. In many cases, the \"th\" is omitted unless the date is being used in a more formal or literary context.\nSince the original text does not include the \"#\" symbol or the \"th\" suffix, the most accurate and neutral translation would be \"April 26.\" This format is widely used in English and aligns with the simplicity and clarity of the original Chinese text. It avoids unnecessary stylistic additions and maintains the integrity of the original format.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of \"# 4月26日\" into English is \"April 26.\"\n\nHKMA launches the FiNETech series to promote fintech innovation. The inaugural FiNETech event brought together approximately 100 banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and technology enterprises to jointly explore advanced collaboration arrangements in Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology.\n\n# May 3rd\n\nThe original text is a concise statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a classification system to support the development of green and sustainable finance. The junior translators have all captured the core message, but there are subtle differences in word choice, punctuation, and tone that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance,\" and \"green and sustainable finance.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the main clause being \"HKMA has published\/issued... to enable... and to promote\/facilitate...\"\n- The use of \"informed decisions\" is appropriate and conveys the intended meaning of \"有根據的決定.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb choice:** \"Published\" vs. \"issued\" – \"Published\" is more neutral and commonly used for official documents, while \"issued\" may imply a more formal or regulatory action. Both are acceptable, but \"published\" may be more natural in this context.\n- **Punctuation:** Some translations use quotation marks (\"...\") while others use single quotes ('...'). In formal writing, double quotation marks are more standard in English.\n- **Prepositions:** \"In developing\" vs. \"when developing\" – \"when developing\" is more natural in this context, as it implies the timing of the decision-making process.\n- **\"Facilitate\" vs. \"promote\":** Both are acceptable, but \"facilitate\" is more precise in the context of enabling or making something easier, while \"promote\" suggests encouraging or advancing. Given the original text uses \"促進,\" which is closer to \"facilitate\" or \"promote,\" both are acceptable, but \"facilitate\" may be more precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"published\" for consistency with the formal release of a document.\n- Use double quotation marks for the title.\n- Use \"when developing\" for natural phrasing.\n- Use \"facilitate\" for \"促進\" to emphasize enabling the flow of capital.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has published the \"Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance\" to enable the industry to make informed decisions when developing green and sustainable finance and to facilitate the flow of green capital.\n\n# June 21\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 6月21日,\" where \"6月21日\" is the date \"June 21st\" in Traditional Chinese. The translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to the correct translation, with only minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, fifth, and sixth translations use \"June 21\" without the \"st\" suffix. This is acceptable in many contexts, especially when the date is used in a list or as a heading. However, in formal or written English, it is more common to include the ordinal suffix \"st\" when writing out the full date.\nThe second, third, and fourth translations use \"June 21st,\" which is the more complete and formal way to write the date in English. The inclusion of the \"st\" suffix is appropriate in this context.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or label, and several translations have preserved this symbol. However, in English, it is more common to use a heading without the \"#\" symbol unless it is part of a specific formatting convention (e.g., in markdown or online content).\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be \"June 21st\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and commonly used format for writing out a date in English.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and clear, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning. However, there are subtle differences in tense, formality, and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"bogus telephone calls\" for \"偽冒來電,\" adhering to the dictionary requirements.\n- The use of \"guidelines\" or \"guidance\" is appropriate, though \"guidelines\" is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts.\n- The phrase \"strengthen consumer protection\" is natural and commonly used in regulatory language.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense:** The first, fourth, and sixth translations use the present perfect (\"has issued\" or \"has issued\") or the past perfect (\"has issued\"), which may be less appropriate in formal announcements unless the action is ongoing or has a lasting effect. The second, third, and fifth translations use the simple past (\"issued\"), which is more direct and commonly used in official statements.\n- **Formality and Precision:** \"Enhance consumer protection\" (used in translations 2 and 5) is slightly less precise than \"strengthen consumer protection\" in the context of regulatory action.\n- **Redundancy:** Translation 6 uses \"the protection of consumers,\" which is slightly more wordy than \"consumer protection.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The most natural and formal tone for an official statement would use the simple past tense (\"issued\") to indicate a completed action.\n- \"Guidelines\" is more precise and commonly used in regulatory contexts than \"guidance.\"\n- \"Strengthen consumer protection\" is more direct and commonly used in such contexts than \"enhance\" or \"the protection of consumers.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against bogus telephone calls.\n\nOn the same day, the Banking Association launched the newly revised Code of Practice on Person-to-Person Marketing Calls, providing updated guidance to the industry on telephone marketing activities.\n\n# June 24\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong\" from the dictionary. It also uses \"SMEs\" for \"中小企\" and \"trade associations and chambers\" for \"商會.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"banking sector\" consistently and correctly. However, it omits \"the\" before \"Banking Association,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"co-organized\" instead of \"jointly organized,\" which is a stylistic choice but still correct. It correctly uses all dictionary terms and maintains a natural flow.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has a critical error: it incorrectly lists \"trade associations and chambers\" as one of the organizers, whereas the original text lists them as participants. It also uses \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" instead of \"SMEs,\" which is less concise. The structure is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"the Hong Kong Banking Association\" (though the dictionary does not specify this, it is a common alternative name). It also uses \"SME operators\" and \"trade associations and chambers\" correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has a minor error: \"SMEs operators\" should be \"SME operators.\" It also uses \"HKCBA\" from the dictionary, which is correct. However, \"the Hong Kong Association of Banks\" is not listed in the dictionary, so it may be less preferred than \"Banking Association\" or \"Hong Kong Banking Association.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The dictionary specifies \"Banking Association\" without further qualification, so it should be used unless a specific alternative is required.\n- \"SMEs\" is the preferred term for \"中小企\" due to its conciseness.\n- \"Trade associations and chambers\" is the correct translation for \"商會.\"\n- \"Jointly organized\" is more formal and appropriate for an official event.\n- \"SME operators\" is more natural than \"SMEs operators.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use \"Banking Association,\" \"SMEs,\" and \"trade associations and chambers,\" and maintain a formal and fluent structure.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA, the Banking Association, and the Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong jointly organized the \"seminar on Banking Sector’s Support Measures for SMEs,\" bringing together 200 representatives from the banking industry, trade associations and chambers, and SME operators to exchange views on the support measures and diversified services provided by the banking sector for SMEs.\n\n# June 25th\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在「慶回歸 • 中企金融服務進社區專題講座」啟動禮上分享打擊詐騙的工作重點。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"financial services.\" The event title is translated clearly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Key focus areas\" is slightly awkward; \"launch ceremony\" is acceptable but \"event\" might be more natural.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** The event title is translated accurately, though \"Celebrating the Handover\" is slightly more formal than \"Celebrating the Return.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key priorities\" and \"China's Financial Services Enter the Community,\" which is more dynamic.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Special Lecture Series\" may not match the original \"專題講座\" (special lecture), which is singular.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Celebrating the Return\" is more commonly used in Hong Kong contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key priorities\" and includes \"Mainland Enterprises,\" which is more specific than \"Chinese Enterprises.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The event title is overly wordy and slightly misrepresents the original.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Return to the Motherland\" is more formal and less commonly used in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key points\" and \"Financial Services of Chinese Enterprises Enter Communities.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Key points\" is less precise than \"key priorities\" or \"focus areas.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Celebrating the Return\" is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key focus areas\" and \"Community-Based Financial Services for Mainland Enterprises,\" which is precise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Thematic seminar\" is slightly off from the original \"專題講座\" (special lecture).  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Celebrating the Return\" is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key priorities\" and \"Community Outreach Seminar Series.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Seminar Series\" again misrepresents the singular \"專題講座.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Celebrating the Return\" is appropriate.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" and \"financial services\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Celebrating the Return\" as it is the most commonly used and culturally appropriate term in Hong Kong.\n- Use \"key priorities\" or \"focus areas\" to convey the emphasis on combating fraud.\n- Accurately reflect \"專題講座\" as a \"special lecture\" or \"thematic lecture.\"\n- Avoid overcomplicating the event title and keep it concise and natural in English.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA shared its key priorities in combating fraud at the launch ceremony of the \"Celebrating the Return • Financial Services of Chinese Enterprises Enter Communities\" special lecture.\n\n# June 28\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of regulatory notices to authorized institutions concerning the cross-boundary credit referencing pilot program. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and precision.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"regulatory notices\" and \"pilot program,\" which are appropriate. However, \"reminding the industry\" is slightly vague; it might be more precise to say \"reminding the financial institutions\" or \"reminding the sector.\"\n- **Translation 2** is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"conducting cross-boundary credit referencing pilot programs.\" The phrasing is slightly awkward, and \"conducting\" may not be the most natural verb in this context.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"supervisory notices\" and \"AIs,\" which are acceptable. However, \"supervisory\" may not be the exact equivalent of \"regulatory\" in this context. Also, \"when conducting\" is slightly less formal than \"in conducting.\"\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and tone. It uses \"regulatory notices\" and \"pilot program,\" which are accurate. The phrase \"in conducting the pilot program\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"when conducting.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"supervisory circulars\" and \"pilot schemes.\" While \"circulars\" is a valid term, \"supervisory\" may not be the best fit for \"regulatory.\" \"Pilot schemes\" is a slightly different term than \"pilot programs\" and may not be as commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 1 and 4, using \"regulatory circulars\" and \"pilot programs.\" However, \"circulars\" may be more specific than \"notices\" in some regulatory contexts, though both are acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"regulatory notices\" as it is the most direct and commonly used term in regulatory contexts. \"Authorized institutions\" is more formal and precise than \"AIs.\" The phrase \"reminding the industry\" is acceptable but could be more specific, such as \"reminding the financial institutions\" or \"reminding the sector.\" The term \"pilot program\" is more commonly used than \"pilot schemes\" or \"pilot programs\" in this context. The phrase \"in conducting the pilot program\" is more natural and formal than \"when conducting.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued two regulatory notices to authorized institutions, reminding the industry to comply with all relevant laws and regulatory requirements in conducting the pilot program for cross-boundary credit referencing.\n\n# July 3rd\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"Legislative Council,\" \"Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2024,\" and \"Deposit Protection Scheme.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations capturing the two-phase implementation and the increase in deposit protection limits.\n- The use of \"HK$800,000\" or \"800,000 Hong Kong dollars\" is appropriate and consistent with financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Implementing the various enhancements\" vs. \"implementing various measures to optimize\"**: The phrase \"enhancements\" is more concise but slightly less precise than \"measures to optimize,\" which better reflects the original wording of \"優化存款保障計劃的各項措施.\"\n- **\"Taking effect on October 1\" vs. \"taking effect officially on October 1\"**: The addition of \"officially\" is redundant and unnecessary, as the date of implementation is already clear.\n- **\"Per customer\" vs. \"per depositor\" vs. \"per account holder\"**: While all are acceptable, \"depositor\" is the most precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n- **\"HK$800,000\" vs. \"800,000 Hong Kong dollars\"**: Both are correct, but \"HK$800,000\" is more concise and commonly used in formal financial documents.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"measures to optimize\" to align with the original wording.\n- Omit redundant words like \"officially\" when the context already implies formality.\n- Use \"depositor\" for consistency and precision.\n- Use \"HK$800,000\" for brevity and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various versions while refining for fluency and precision.\nThe Legislative Council passed the Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2024, implementing various measures to optimize the Deposit Protection Scheme in two phases. The first phase of the optimization measures took effect on October 1, including raising the deposit protection limit for each depositor at each bank to HK$800,000.\n\n# August 1st\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical consistency, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Police Force,\" \"internet banking,\" \"physical branch transactions,\" \"Automated Teller Machine,\" and \"cash deposit machines.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- The use of \"Suspicious Account Alert\" is consistent across all translations, which is the preferred term from the dictionary.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"will be expanded\" and \"will further extend,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly repetitive.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"has announced\" and \"will be further extended,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 3** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with no significant improvement.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"was further expanded,\" which is grammatically correct but may imply a completed action rather than a future one, which is less consistent with the original text.\n- **Translation 5** introduces \"Hong Kong Banking Association\" instead of \"Banking Association\" and uses \"ATM\" instead of \"Automated Teller Machine,\" which is acceptable but not the exact dictionary term.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"banking industry\" instead of \"Banking Association,\" which is a slight deviation from the dictionary and may be less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain the use of \"Banking Association\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"will be expanded\" consistently for future actions.\n- Ensure that \"Automated Teller Machine\" is used in full, as it is the preferred term in the dictionary.\n- Avoid using \"ATM\" unless it is explicitly defined in the text.\n- Ensure that the verb tenses are consistent with the original meaning (future actions).\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Hong Kong Police Force (police) and the Banking Association, announced that the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism will be expanded to cover internet banking and physical branch transactions. The scope of the alert mechanism will be further extended in December to include Automated Teller Machine (including cash deposit machines) transactions.\n\nA series of enhanced anti-fraud efforts have also been launched simultaneously. For example, the HKMA, police, and the banking industry have jointly established a mechanism to provide the \"Scameter+\" mobile application with more timely and updated alerts about fake bank websites and suspicious calls.\n\n# August 2nd\n\nHKMA shared its insights on measures to prevent and detect financial crime at the Financial Institutions AML Forum 2024.\n\n# August 5th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"public consultation,\" \"three-tier banking system,\" and \"two-tier banking system.\" All translations capture the main idea that the HKMA has published a summary of public consultation on reviewing the three-tier banking system and that respondents broadly support the proposal to implement a two-tier system.\nWeaknesses include minor grammatical and stylistic issues. For example, the first translation uses \"published\" in the past tense, which is correct, but the second and third translations use \"published\" without \"the\" before \"summary,\" which is slightly less formal. The fourth translation uses the present tense \"publishes,\" which is incorrect in this context, as the action has already been completed. The fifth and sixth translations use \"has published,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than necessary for a news-style summary.\nIn terms of fluency, the fifth and sixth translations are the most natural, using \"The HKMA has published\" and \"The HKMA published\" respectively, both of which are acceptable. However, \"published\" in the simple past tense is more commonly used in such contexts, making the sixth translation slightly more appropriate.\nThe use of \"the new two-tier banking system\" in translations 2, 3, and 5 adds clarity, emphasizing that the proposed system is a new structure. However, the original Chinese does not explicitly use the word \"new,\" so including it may be an interpretive addition. That said, it does not distort the meaning and may even enhance clarity.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use the simple past tense \"published,\" include \"the\" before \"summary,\" and optionally include \"the new\" before \"two-tier banking system\" to reflect the novelty of the proposed system, while maintaining fluency and grammatical correctness.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA published a summary of the public consultation on the review of the three-tier banking system, with respondents broadly supporting the proposal to implement the new two-tier banking system.\n\n# August 6th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, verb choice, and preposition usage that affect the overall quality.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"policy targets\" for \"政策目標.\" The term \"virtual banks\" is consistently used for \"虛擬銀行,\" which is appropriate in this context. All translations maintain the structure and meaning of the original sentence.\nWeaknesses include the use of \"has achieved\" in all translations, which is grammatically correct but slightly less dynamic than alternatives like \"has met\" or \"has fulfilled.\" Additionally, the preposition \"for introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong\" is used in all translations, but \"to Hong Kong\" in the fourth translation is more concise and natural in English.\nThe verb choices vary slightly: \"issued,\" \"published,\" \"released,\" and \"has published\" are all acceptable, but \"published\" is the most neutral and commonly used in formal contexts. The inclusion of \"has\" in some translations (\"has published,\" \"has released\") adds a slight nuance of ongoing action, which may not be necessary here.\nTo improve the translation, the verb \"published\" is preferable for its neutrality and clarity. The preposition \"to\" is more natural than \"in\" when referring to introducing something to a place. The phrase \"has achieved\" can be replaced with \"has met\" for a more formal tone.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"published,\" \"to Hong Kong,\" and \"has met\" to enhance fluency and formality.\nThe final translation is:\nThe HKMA published a review report on virtual banks. According to the review results, the development of virtual banks has met the three policy targets for introducing virtual banks to Hong Kong.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. The use of \"relaxation of requirements for their business and operations\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable. The phrase \"subsequently published a summary of the public consultation regarding the proposal\" is slightly formal but appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. The use of \"relaxed regulations regarding their operations\" is concise and natural. The structure \"published in October a summary of the public consultation on the proposal\" is slightly awkward but still understandable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The phrase \"rename 'virtual banks' as 'digital banks'\" is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"rename 'virtual banks' to 'digital banks'.\" The phrase \"relaxation of its business and operations\" is awkward and unclear, as \"its\" could be misinterpreted.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. The use of \"relaxed requirements for its operations\" is concise and natural. The structure \"published a summary of the public consultation on the proposal to rename\" is fluent and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: The phrase \"its proposal\" is slightly ambiguous, as it could imply the HKMA's proposal is the subject, rather than the renaming. The phrase \"relaxation of regulations regarding their business and operations\" is accurate but slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very fluent and natural. The use of \"proposed renaming\" is concise and idiomatic. The phrase \"relaxation of regulations on their business and operations\" is clear and natural.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use natural English phrasing. It should also accurately reflect the original meaning and use the correct terminology from the dictionary. The phrase \"relaxed requirements for its operations\" is more natural than \"relaxation of requirements for their business and operations.\" Additionally, the use of \"proposed renaming\" is more idiomatic than \"proposal to rename.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA published a summary of the public consultation on the proposed renaming of \"virtual banks\" to \"digital banks\" in October. Respondents generally supported the proposal. The new name and the relaxed requirements for its operations took effect on October 25.\n\n# August 8\n\nHKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) has introduced new arrangements under the Mortgage Insurance Programme, considering on a case-by-case basis the approval for eligible homeowners to rent out their self-occupied properties.\n\n# August 9\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, written as \"# 8月9日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first and fifth translations use \"August 9\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is acceptable in informal contexts but less common in formal writing. The second, third, fourth, and sixth translations use \"August 9th,\" which is more standard in formal English writing.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or label, but it is not necessary in the English translation unless it serves a specific formatting purpose. Since the dictionary is empty, there are no specific terms to be translated exactly, and the task is to provide a fluent and natural English translation.\nConsidering the above, the most appropriate translation would be \"August 9\" as it is concise and commonly used in English for dates. However, \"August 9th\" is also acceptable and may be preferred in more formal contexts. Given the simplicity of the original text, \"August 9\" is the most natural and concise translation.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a standard news headline about an official agreement between two regulatory bodies. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, tense, and formality that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"have signed\" which is appropriate for a completed action. The use of \"MoU\" is correct and concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and natural. The use of \"signed an MoU with Indonesia's Financial Services Authority\" is clear and grammatically correct. The structure is slightly more formal than the first translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is correct but slightly wordier with \"exchange and cooperation of regulatory information.\" The phrase \"exchange and cooperation of\" is less idiomatic than \"exchange of... and cooperation.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation, similar to the second one. It uses \"signed a Memorandum of Understanding\" and \"enhance the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\" The phrasing is natural and formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The use of \"signs\" is problematic because it implies a habitual or ongoing action, not a completed event. This is incorrect in the context of a specific event that has already occurred.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a solid translation, similar to the first and fourth. It uses \"signed a MoU\" and \"strengthen the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\" The only minor issue is the lack of the possessive \"Indonesia's,\" which is not strictly necessary but adds clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also use the correct tense to reflect that the signing has already occurred. The use of \"MoU\" is preferable for brevity, though \"Memorandum of Understanding\" is also acceptable. The possessive \"Indonesia's\" is optional but adds clarity. The phrase \"enhance the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation\" is more natural than \"strengthen the exchange and cooperation of regulatory information.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nHKMA and Indonesia's Financial Services Authority\/Otoritas Jasa Keuangan signed an MoU to enhance the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\n\n# August 13\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in style and completeness that can be refined. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a strong point. However, some translations omit minor details or use slightly less precise phrasing.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and concise, using \"fields of banking, securities, insurance, and technology.\" However, \"fields of\" is slightly less common than \"sectors\" in this context.\nTranslation 2 is also accurate but uses \"Cyberport\" instead of the full name, which is acceptable but may be less formal than using the full name in a formal context.\nTranslation 3 is identical to Translation 1, which is fine, but it does not add any new value.\nTranslation 4 is the most complete, using \"organized\" instead of \"hosted\" and including \"to attend,\" which adds a bit more clarity. However, \"organized\" is slightly less common than \"hosted\" in the context of events.\nTranslation 5 is the most concise, using \"Cyberport\" and \"FinTech Association of Hong Kong\" without the full names, which is acceptable but may be less formal.\nTranslation 6 is identical to Translation 1, which is fine but again does not add any new value.\nConsidering these points, the best approach is to use the full names for the organizations as they appear in the dictionary, use \"hosted\" as it is more commonly used in event contexts, and use \"sectors\" for a more formal and precise tone.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nHKMA, Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited (Cyberport), and the FinTech Association of Hong Kong jointly hosted the second FiNETech, attracting over 300 professionals from the banking, securities, insurance, and technology sectors.\n\nDuring the event, the HKMA and Cyberport announced the launch of a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Sandbox, aimed at promoting responsible innovation in the banking sector's development of GenAI. The list of initial GenAI Sandbox participants was announced in December, comprising 15 use cases from ten banks and four technology partners.\nDuring the event, the HKMA and Cyberport announced the launch of a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Sandbox, aimed at promoting responsible innovation in the banking sector's development of GenAI. The list of initial GenAI Sandbox participants was announced in December, comprising 15 use cases from ten banks and four technology partners.\n\n# August 15th\n\nThe HKMA, together with the police, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, and the Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong, announced a series of measures to protect university students from becoming victims of scams.\n\n# August 18\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a standard news headline or official statement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" and either \"Memorandum of Understanding\" or \"MoU\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with the subject (HKMA and Maldives Monetary Authority) followed by the action (signed) and the purpose (to enhance\/strengthen the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation).\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"enhance the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"strengthen.\"\n- The third junior translator uses \"strengthen the exchange and cooperation of regulatory information,\" which is awkward phrasing. \"Exchange and cooperation\" should not be directly linked to \"regulatory information\" in this way.\n- The fifth junior translator uses \"MoU\" instead of \"Memorandum of Understanding,\" which is acceptable but less formal and may be less appropriate in a formal context.\n- The sixth junior translator uses \"strengthen the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation,\" which is the most precise and natural phrasing among the translations.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Strengthen\" is more commonly used in formal contexts to describe the deepening of cooperation or information sharing than \"enhance.\"\n- \"Memorandum of Understanding\" is the full and more formal term, which is appropriate for official statements.\n- The phrase \"exchange of regulatory information and cooperation\" is more natural than \"exchange and cooperation of regulatory information.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nHKMA and the Maldives Monetary Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\n\n# August 19th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 8月19日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first and fifth translations use \"August 19\" without the \"th\" suffix, while the second, third, fourth, and sixth translations use \"August 19th\". The use of the \"th\" suffix is more common in American English, while British English often omits it in informal contexts. However, in formal or written contexts, \"August 19th\" is more precise and commonly used.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or section marker. The first and fifth translations omit it, while the second and fifth translations include it. In English, the \"#\" symbol is often used as a hashtag or to denote a section, so including it in the translation is appropriate.\nConsidering these factors, \"August 19th\" is the most accurate and natural translation of the date, and including the \"#\" symbol is appropriate to maintain the original format. Therefore, the best possible translation is \"August 19th\".\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and precision that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"GenAI,\" and \"consumer protection.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the message is clear in all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"guidelines,\" \"principles,\" and \"encourages banks to explore\" is appropriate and aligns with the formal tone of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and word choice:** Some translations repeat the word \"guidelines\" unnecessarily (e.g., \"providing a set of guidelines for the application of GenAI to ensure consumer protection\"). This can be simplified for better fluency.\n- **Verb tense and formality:** The first translation uses \"issued guidelines to banks, providing a set of guidelines,\" which is slightly awkward. The second and third translations use \"has issued\" and \"has issued guidelines to banks regarding,\" which are more natural and formal.\n- **Use of \"guiding principles\" vs. \"principles\":** Some translations use \"guiding principles,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary. \"Principles\" alone is sufficient and more concise.\n- **\"Leveraging artificial intelligence\" vs. \"use of artificial intelligence\":** While both are correct, \"use of artificial intelligence\" is more standard in formal contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"guidance\" or \"guidelines\" consistently, avoiding repetition.\n- Choose more concise and formal phrasing, such as \"setting out principles\" or \"providing a set of principles.\"\n- Ensure that the verb tenses and sentence structures are consistent and natural in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that is concise, fluent, and maintains the formal tone of the original, while using the correct dictionary terms and avoiding redundancy.\nThe final translation is:\nThe HKMA has issued guidance to banks, providing a set of principles for the application of GenAI to ensure consumer protection. The HKMA also encourages banks to actively explore the use of artificial intelligence to enhance consumer protection.\n\n# August 23rd\n\nThe original text discusses the establishment of a joint taskforce by the HKMA and the Banking Association to support SMEs at both the case and industry levels. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"jointly established a joint\" which is redundant. Also, \"at both the case and industry levels\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"the Hong Kong Association of Banks\" which is not in the dictionary. \"At both the individual case and industry levels\" is more precise than \"case and industry levels.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"from the case and industry levels\" which is grammatically incorrect. Also, \"Banking Association\" is not in the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"advance\" instead of \"promote,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable. \"At both the case and industry levels\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"from both case and industry perspectives,\" which is more natural than \"levels.\" However, \"Banking Association\" is not in the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"a joint Taskforce on SME Lending\" which is correct. \"From both individual and industry perspectives\" is more natural than \"levels.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" and \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" as per the dictionary. It should use \"SMEs\" for \"中小企\" and \"Taskforce on SME Lending\" for the full term. The phrase \"at both the case and industry levels\" is awkward; \"from both case and industry perspectives\" is more natural. Also, \"jointly established\" should not be repeated.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association have jointly established the Taskforce on SME Lending to further promote support for SMEs from both case and industry perspectives.\n\n# September 9th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Cyberport,\" and \"suspicious activity monitoring.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- The use of \"co-hosting\" or \"co-organizing\" is appropriate and reflects the collaborative nature of the event.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Prepositions:** Some translations use \"by banks\" (e.g., Translation 2 and 3), which is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than \"in banking\" or \"in the banking sector.\"\n- **Word Choice:** \"The authority\" (Translation 4 and 6) is more natural than \"the authorities\" (used in Translations 1, 2, 3, and 5), as the HKMA is a singular entity.\n- **Verb Tense and Clarity:** Translation 5 uses \"has taken\" and \"hosting\" in a way that slightly disrupts the parallel structure of the sentence.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** \"Share relevant experiences\" (used in Translations 1, 3, and 5) is slightly more repetitive than \"share relevant experience\" (used in Translations 2, 4, and 6), which is more concise and natural in English.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"the authority\" instead of \"the authorities\" to reflect the singular nature of the HKMA.\n- Use \"in banking\" or \"in the banking sector\" instead of \"by banks\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Use \"co-organizing\" instead of \"co-hosting\" for a more formal tone, which is appropriate for official announcements.\n- Use \"share relevant experience\" for conciseness and natural flow.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and grammatically accurate versions while ensuring consistency and natural phrasing.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued a notice to share the advantages of artificial intelligence in suspicious activity monitoring, as well as the measures taken by the authority to support and accelerate the banking sector's application of AI, including co-organizing a forum with Cyberport in November to share relevant experience.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, formality, and word choice that affect fluency and precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and concise. It uses \"consultation summary document\" and \"take effect,\" which are appropriate. However, \"take effect\" is slightly less formal than \"come into effect.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version uses \"concluding paper\" instead of \"summary document,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. \"Enhancement\" is a good synonym for \"optimization,\" though \"enhancement\" may imply a different kind of improvement than \"optimization.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with the addition of \"of their joint consultation,\" which adds clarity. However, it is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is nearly identical to the first, with no significant differences in meaning or fluency.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version uses \"summary document on their joint consultation regarding the optimization,\" which is slightly more precise. It also uses \"come into effect,\" which is more formal and commonly used in official contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version uses \"consultation summary paper\" and \"optimisation\" (British spelling), which is acceptable but may be less common in American English. It also uses \"take effect,\" which is slightly less formal than \"come into effect.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement**:\n- \"Consultation summary document\" is a standard term in regulatory contexts and is used consistently across most translations.\n- \"Come into effect\" is more formal and commonly used in legal and regulatory documents than \"take effect.\"\n- \"Optimization\" is the preferred term in this context, as it aligns with the original Chinese term and is more precise than \"enhancement.\"\n- The use of \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" is consistent with the dictionary and should be retained.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) jointly issued a consultation summary document on optimizing Hong Kong's over-the-counter derivatives reporting regime. The proposed optimization measures will come into effect on September 29, 2025.\n\n# September 27\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in tone, fluency, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Grammar and Syntax**: All translations are grammatically correct, but some use \"has published\" (e.g., translations 3 and 5), which is slightly more formal than \"published\" or \"releases.\" While not incorrect, \"published\" is more commonly used in such contexts.\n2. **Fluency and Style**: The use of \"in-depth exploring\" (translation 1) is awkward and should be \"in-depth exploration\" or \"thoroughly exploring.\" Similarly, \"delving into\" (translation 2) is more concise and natural than \"in-depth exploring.\"\n3. **Punctuation and Quotation Marks**: Some translations use quotation marks around the title (translations 1, 4, 6), which is appropriate for formal titles. Others omit them (translations 2, 3, 5), which is less precise.\n4. **Word Choice**: \"Releases\" (translation 2) is less common than \"published\" in formal contexts. \"Publishes\" (translation 4) is more neutral and appropriate.\n5. **Structure and Flow**: Translation 6 uses \"which thoroughly explores\" to introduce the content of the report, which adds clarity and improves the flow of the sentence.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation should use \"published\" as the verb, include quotation marks around the title, and use \"thoroughly exploring\" or \"which thoroughly explores\" for clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA has published the \"Research Paper on Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Services Sector,\" which thoroughly explores the transformative potential of GenAI and its impact on the financial industry, particularly in terms of operational efficiency, risk management, and customer engagement.\n\n# September 30th\n\nThe original text is concise and formal, reflecting a governmental or regulatory context. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in tense, prepositions, and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構.\"\n- The term \"public consultation\" is consistently translated, which is crucial for maintaining the formal tone of the original.\n- The phrase \"respondents generally supported the proposal\" is well-received in most translations, accurately reflecting the sentiment of the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense:** Some translations use the present tense (\"publishes\") while others use the past tense (\"published\"). The original uses the past tense (\"發表\"), so \"published\" is more accurate.\n- **Prepositions:** \"On\" vs. \"regarding\" – both are acceptable, but \"on\" is more direct and commonly used in such contexts.\n- **\"Proposals\" vs. \"recommendations\":** The original refers to \"建議,\" which is best translated as \"recommendations\" in a formal context.\n- **\"Support\" vs. \"supported\":** The original uses the past tense, so \"supported\" is more consistent.\n- **\"Crimes\" vs. \"crime\":** The original uses the plural, which is more appropriate in the context of multiple types of offenses.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the past tense consistently (\"published\").\n- Use \"on\" rather than \"regarding\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"recommendations\" for \"建議\" to reflect the formal nature of the consultation.\n- Use \"supported\" to match the past tense of the original.\n- Use \"crimes\" to match the plural form in the original.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\n**The HKMA published a summary of the public consultation on authorized institutions exchanging information to assist in preventing or detecting crimes. Respondents generally supported the recommendations.**\n\n# October 9th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 10月9日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"October 9th\" or \"# October 9\", while the third and fourth use \"October 9\" or \"# October 9\".\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be \"October 9th\", as it correctly uses the ordinal form of the date, which is standard in English. The use of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement not indicated in the original text. Since the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it should be retained in the translation to maintain consistency.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be \"# October 9th\".\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"ICAC,\" \"Banking Industry Integrity Charter,\" \"retail banks,\" and \"private wealth management banks.\"\n- Most translations accurately reflect the key points: the support of the HKMA and the Banking Association, the co-organization of the launch ceremony with the ICAC, and the attendance of 30 banks, including major retail and private wealth management banks.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" instead of \"Banking Association\" or \"Bankers Association,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be less standard.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Banking Association\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is acceptable but less precise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Bankers Association,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be less commonly used than \"Banking Association.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be redundant or incorrect.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Banking Association\" and \"Management representatives,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Banking Association\" and \"jointly organize,\" which is grammatically incorrect in the context (should be \"jointly organized\").\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Banking Association\" consistently, as it is the most neutral and standard term.\n- Use \"co-organized\" or \"co-hosted\" to reflect the past tense of the event.\n- Use \"senior management\" or \"management\" consistently, depending on the tone desired.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"covering Hong Kong's major retail banks and private wealth management banks\" is used to clearly indicate the scope of the banks involved.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Banking Association support the Banking Industry Integrity Charter launched by the ICAC and co-organized the launch ceremony of the Integrity Charter with the ICAC. Senior management from 30 banks attended the ceremony, covering Hong Kong's major retail banks and private wealth management banks.\n\n# October 10th\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of a regulation that sets the effective date for the final Basel III reform package in Hong Kong. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and adherence to formal legal style.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"published in the Gazette\" which is appropriate for legal notices. However, \"final reform package\" is slightly informal compared to \"final reform plan\" or \"final reform measures.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. The use of \"gazetted\" is appropriate, and \"will take effect\" is a natural legal phrasing. However, the title \"Notice on the Effective Date of the 2023 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules (2024)\" is slightly awkward due to the placement of the year.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The title is slightly off, using \"Notice of the Effective Date\" instead of \"Notice on the Effective Date,\" which is less common in legal English. The use of \"final reforms of 'Basel III'\" is slightly less precise than \"final reform package of Basel III.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most fluent and accurate translation. It uses \"has been published\" and \"designating\" which are appropriate for formal legal notices. The title is well-structured and the phrasing is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The title is awkward and overly complex, using \"Notice of Publication of the 'Banking (Capital) (Revised) Rules (Effective Date) 2024.'\" The phrase \"date of effectuation\" is overly formal and not commonly used in legal English.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a critical error in the title, stating \"2024 Revised Banking (Capital) Rules (2023)\" which is logically inconsistent. The year 2024 should not be paired with the 2023 rules. This is a major flaw in the translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and use standard legal terminology. It should correctly reflect the title of the notice and the effective date of the Basel III reform package. The fourth junior translator's version is the closest to this standard, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Notice on the Coming into Force Date of the 2023 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules (2024) has been published, designating January 1, 2025, as the effective date of the final Basel III reform package in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 10th\n\nTo prevent malware scams involving payment card transactions, the HKMA has provided guidance to banks to further strengthen the security of online payment card transactions. Starting from the end of 2024, bank customers will be able to use mobile banking Apps instead of SMS one-time passwords for online payment card transactions.\n\n# October 16th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary, such as \"HKMA,\" \"countercyclical macroprudential measures,\" \"property mortgage loans,\" \"maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios,\" \"non-residential properties,\" and \"debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"uniformly set\" or \"standardized\" is appropriate for conveying the policy change.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"guidance\" while others use \"guidelines.\" While both are acceptable, \"guidelines\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts and may be more precise.\n- The phrase \"after the revision\" or \"after revision\" is used inconsistently. \"After the revision\" is slightly more natural in formal writing.\n- The use of \"percent\" versus \"%\" is inconsistent. In formal writing, it is preferable to use the symbol \"%\" for consistency and brevity.\n- The inclusion of \"debt servicing ratio (DSR)\" in parentheses is helpful for clarity, but not all translations include it, which may affect the reader's understanding of the term.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"guidelines\" instead of \"guidance\" for consistency with regulatory terminology.\n- Use \"after the revision\" for grammatical consistency and natural phrasing.\n- Use the symbol \"%\" consistently for percentages.\n- Include the full term \"debt servicing ratio (DSR)\" for clarity, especially since it is a technical term.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing, precise terminology, and consistent formatting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued guidelines to banks to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures applicable to property mortgage loans. After the revision, the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for all residential and non-residential properties are uniformly set at 70%, and the debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit is uniformly set at 50%.\n\n# October 16th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical consistency, and the use of quotation marks and abbreviations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. It uses \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" consistently and correctly applies the dictionary terms. However, it uses \"take effect\" instead of \"take effect on,\" which is slightly less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"enhanced measures\" and includes quotation marks around the terms from the dictionary, which adds clarity. However, it uses \"took effect\" in the past tense, which may be less appropriate if the date is in the future or present.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"optimize\" and \"partial principal repayment options\" correctly. However, it uses \"took effect\" in the past tense, which may not be ideal if the date is current or future.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses the abbreviation \"SFGS\" and quotation marks appropriately. However, it uses \"will be extended\" and \"will be provided,\" which may be less precise than the past tense if the measures are already in effect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and uses quotation marks effectively. It also uses \"newly created loans\" instead of \"new loans,\" which is slightly more precise. However, it uses \"November 18th\" with the \"th\" suffix, which is less common in formal writing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the second and is grammatically sound. It uses \"enhanced measures\" and \"took effect\" in the past tense. However, it lacks quotation marks around the dictionary terms, which may reduce clarity.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use of quotation marks around dictionary terms enhances clarity and shows that these are specific program names or features.\n- Consistency in tense is important. If the measures are already in effect, the past tense \"took effect\" is appropriate. However, if the date is current or future, the present tense \"take effect\" is better.\n- The use of \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" is preferred over the abbreviation \"SFGS\" unless the abbreviation has been previously defined.\n- \"New loans\" is more concise and commonly used than \"newly created loans.\"\n- The phrase \"partial principal repayment options\" should be in quotation marks to indicate it is a specific feature.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe government announced enhanced measures for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for up to 12 months of \"principal moratorium\" on existing and new loans. Additionally, the maximum loan guarantee periods for the 80% and \"90% Guarantee Product\" have been extended to 10 and 8 years respectively, and \"partial principal repayment options\" are now available for new loans under both guarantee products. These measures take effect on November 18.\n\n# October 18th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese: \"# 10月18日\". The \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or section marker, and \"10月18日\" translates to \"October 18th\" in English.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"October 18th\"** – This is correct and natural, but it omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be important for formatting or context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# October 18\"** – This preserves the \"#\" symbol and the date, but \"October 18\" is less formal than \"October 18th\" and may not match the tone of the original.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"October 18th\"** – Same as the first, missing the \"#\" symbol.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# October 18\"** – Same as the second, preserving the symbol but using a less formal date format.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"October 18\"** – This is the least formal and omits both the \"#\" symbol and the \"th\" suffix.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"October 18th\"** – Same as the first and third, missing the \"#\" symbol.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nThe \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or section marker, so it should be preserved in the translation. The date format \"October 18th\" is more natural and formal in English than \"October 18.\" Therefore, the best translation would be \"# October 18th,\" which preserves the original formatting and uses the most natural English date format.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"credit products\" for \"信貸產品.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations capturing the main idea of the five measures introduced by the HKMA and the banking sector to support SMEs.\n- The use of \"SMEs\" as an abbreviation for \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" is appropriate and commonly used in formal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"launching\" while others use \"introduced,\" which may affect the tone. \"Introduced\" is more neutral and formal, which is suitable for official announcements.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations include unnecessary words, such as \"helping them explore new business opportunities and markets\" in Translation 3, which is slightly redundant compared to \"assist them in exploring new business and markets.\"\n- **Use of \"special funds\" vs. \"dedicated funds\":** Translation 5 uses \"special funds,\" which is not listed in the dictionary. The correct term is \"dedicated funds.\"\n- **\"Banks\" vs. \"banking sector\":** Translation 6 uses \"banks\" instead of \"banking sector,\" which is less formal and less aligned with the original text's tone.\n- **\"Transformation\" vs. \"turning around\" or \"restructuring\":** While \"transformation\" is acceptable, it may be more precise to use \"transformation\" in the context of SMEs adapting to new markets and business models.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and use the exact terms from the dictionary. It should avoid redundancy and maintain a consistent tone. Based on these considerations, the best translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent versions while ensuring adherence to the dictionary and clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the banking sector, has introduced five new measures to further support the continued development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and assist them in exploring new business and markets, from the aspects of funding and banking products and services. These include releasing bank capital to facilitate SMEs' financing needs; setting aside dedicated funds to support SMEs; and introducing more credit products and services to assist SMEs in their transformation.\n\n# October 28th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely serving as a heading or marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with the primary difference being the use of \"October 28th\" versus \"October 28\" and the inclusion or exclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in translating the date itself, which is straightforward. However, there are minor differences in formatting that could affect the perceived professionalism or consistency of the text. The use of \"October 28th\" with the ordinal suffix \"th\" is more common in formal or written English, while \"October 28\" is also acceptable, particularly in contexts where brevity is preferred.\nThe inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is consistent with the original text, which may be important for formatting or categorization purposes. However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date formatting unless it serves a specific function, such as indicating a heading or a section title.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"October 28th\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and commonly used format for dates in English. If the \"#\" symbol is intended to serve a specific function in the context, it may be retained, but in the absence of additional context, it is safer to omit it to ensure clarity and naturalness in the English translation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"enhancing cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)\" and \"driving the shared growth of the fintech ecosystem.\" The term \"fintech innovation\" is not used, which is acceptable since the dictionary allows for either \"fintech\" or \"fintech innovation.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"collective growth\" and \"enhancing its capabilities,\" which are slightly more formal than the original. The use of \"Management Bureau\" is correct, though \"Authority\" is also acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"fostering collaboration\" instead of \"promoting collaboration,\" which is slightly more natural. However, it uses \"fintech sourcing platform\" instead of \"cross-sectoral sourcing platform,\" which is slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"fostering collaboration\" and \"common growth,\" which are natural choices. It also uses \"GBA\" without the full name, which is acceptable in context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is slightly less accurate. It uses \"fintech innovation\" instead of \"fintech services,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary. It also uses \"fostering collaboration and innovation\" instead of \"promoting collaboration and innovation,\" which is slightly less direct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is a strong translation, very similar to the second. It uses \"joint growth\" and \"strengthening cooperation in the GBA,\" which are natural and accurate. It also uses \"partnered with\" instead of \"collaborates with,\" which is slightly more formal but still correct.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"fintech services\" should be used consistently, as it is the most direct translation from the dictionary.\n- \"Promoting collaboration and innovation\" is more direct than \"fostering\" or \"driving.\"\n- \"Enhancing cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)\" is more precise than \"strengthening cooperation in the GBA.\"\n- \"Cross-sectoral sourcing platform\" should be used as per the dictionary.\n- \"Fintech solution providers\" should be used consistently.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent versions, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA has launched the cross-sectoral sourcing platform \"Fintech Connect\" to connect financial institutions with fintech solution providers. The platform provides one-stop assistance in accurately matching the supply and demand for fintech services, promoting collaboration and innovation. The HKMA is collaborating with the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone to include fintech solution providers from Qianhai, further strengthening the platform and enhancing cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), driving the common growth of the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# November 5th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"payment card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses,\" \"payment card direct debit authorisation,\" and \"merchant institutions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the intent of the sentence is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of \"enhance consumer protection\" or \"strengthen consumer protection\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Modality:** Some translations use \"issues\" (present tense) while others use \"has issued\" (past perfect). The original Chinese uses the present perfect tense (\"發出\"), which is best rendered as \"has issued.\"\n- **Word Choice:** \"Go out of business\" and \"close down\" are both acceptable, but \"close down\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like regulatory guidelines.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use \"in order to\" or \"regarding,\" which are grammatically correct but can be more naturally phrased as \"to\" or \"on.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"merchant institutions\" unnecessarily, while others use \"merchants,\" which is more concise and natural in English.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The verb \"has issued\" is more accurate than \"issues\" or \"issued\" in this context, as it reflects a completed action with ongoing relevance.\n- \"Merchant institutions\" is the exact term from the dictionary, but \"merchants\" is more natural and commonly used in English regulatory texts.\n- \"To enhance consumer protection\" is more concise and natural than \"in order to enhance consumer protection.\"\n- \"Suspend operations or close down\" is a balanced and natural phrasing that avoids redundancy and maintains clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has issued guidelines to banks engaged in payment card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses regarding payment card direct debit authorisation, to enhance consumer protection when merchants suspend operations or close down.\n\n# November 8th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, and the junior translators have mostly captured its meaning accurately. However, there are subtle differences in tense, phrasing, and formality that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"cooling-off period,\" and \"unsecured consumer credit products.\"\n- The core message—introducing a cooling-off period to promote responsible lending and reduce risks—is preserved in all versions.\n- The sentence structure is generally clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense:** The original text uses the present tense (\"引入\") to indicate a current policy action. However, translations 3 and 4 use the simple past tense (\"introduces\" and \"has introduced\"), which may imply the action is completed or less current. Translations 1, 5, and 6 use the present continuous (\"is introducing\") or simple past (\"introduced\"), which are more appropriate depending on the context of when the policy was implemented.\n- **\"Responsible lending\" vs. \"responsible borrowing\":** The original uses \"推廣負責任借貸,\" which refers to responsible lending practices by financial institutions, not just responsible borrowing by consumers. Therefore, \"responsible lending\" is more accurate than \"responsible borrowing.\"\n- **Fluency and formality:** While all translations are fluent, the use of \"The HKMA\" in translations 1, 5, and 6 adds a slight formality that may be more appropriate for official or formal contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the present continuous tense (\"is introducing\") to reflect an ongoing or current policy implementation.\n- It should use \"responsible lending\" to align with the original's focus on institutional responsibility.\n- The phrase \"The HKMA\" is more formal and appropriate for official announcements.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is introducing a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to promote responsible lending and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing.\n\n# November 11th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. It correctly uses \"SME Digital Technology Solution Day\" and \"digital transformation.\" However, it uses \"the Banking Association\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" or \"the Hong Kong Banking Association,\" which may not be the exact term from the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and uses the dictionary terms correctly. It uses \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" and \"SMEs\" as per the dictionary. The structure is clear and the language is natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"banking associations\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" which is not precise. It also uses \"digital technology solutions providers\" instead of \"technology solution providers,\" which is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses the dictionary terms correctly, including \"HKCBA\" as an alternative for \"Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong.\" It uses \"on-site\" and \"tailored for SMEs,\" which are natural expressions. However, it uses \"SMEs\" instead of \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" in one instance, which is acceptable but less formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"the banking association\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" which is not the exact term from the dictionary. It also uses \"banks\" instead of \"bank representatives,\" which is less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses the dictionary terms correctly. It uses \"banking professionals\" instead of \"bank representatives,\" which is slightly different but still acceptable. It also uses \"on-site\" and \"tailored for SMEs,\" which are natural expressions.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the exact dictionary terms, maintain fluency, and ensure clarity. Based on the above review, the second and sixth translations are the most accurate. However, the second translation uses \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" and \"SMEs\" consistently, which aligns well with the dictionary. It also uses \"on-site\" and \"digital transformation\" correctly. The sixth translation is also strong but uses \"banking professionals\" instead of \"bank representatives,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA, Cyberport, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, and the Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong jointly organized the \"SME Digital Technology Solution Day.\" Over 100 representatives from SMEs in the food and beverage and retail sectors, bank representatives, and technology solution providers exchanged views on how the banking industry can support SMEs' digital transformation through big data and technology. Technology service companies also showcased various digital technology solutions tailored for SMEs on-site.\n\n# November 13\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" and \"DPO\" as per the dictionary. It uses \"fraud tactics\" and \"best practices,\" which are appropriate. However, \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" is not the exact term in the dictionary, which lists \"banking association\" or \"banking associations\" without specifying \"Hong Kong.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"Digital Policy Office\" and \"fraud tactics involving deepfake technology,\" which is a natural phrasing. It also uses \"good practices\" instead of \"best practices,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"modus operandi\" instead of \"fraud tactics,\" which is a valid dictionary option but less commonly used in this context. It also omits \"Hong Kong\" from \"Banking Association,\" which may be acceptable but less precise.\n4. **Translation 4** is concise and fluent, using \"Digital Policy Office\" and \"good practices.\" However, it omits \"HKMA\" from the full name in the first sentence, which may be less formal than the original.\n5. **Translation 5** is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"police force\" instead of \"police,\" which is slightly more formal. It also uses \"hosted\" instead of \"organized,\" which is acceptable but less common in official contexts.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most comprehensive, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" which are more precise than \"Banking Association.\" It also uses \"fraud tactics involving deepfake technology\" and \"best practices,\" which are natural and accurate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the police, the Digital Policy Office (DPO), and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, jointly organized an anti-digital fraud workshop to enhance the industry's awareness of fraud tactics involving deepfake technology and to share best practices for managing related risks.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2025 年工作重點及前瞻\n\n2025年環球經濟前景仍然不明朗，美國的經濟與貿易政策存在顯著的不確定性，加上美國通脹面對上行風險，以致市場憂慮美國政策利率的未來走向。與此同時，在中國內地公布及陸續推出經濟刺激措施後，內地與香港的市場氣氛改善，而政府推出的各項相關支持措施應可令訪港旅遊業進一步改善。香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局將繼續致力促進香港金融體系及基建的穩定與健全。面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，我們會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，我們會積極把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港的國際金融中心地位。我們會繼續謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 金融體系穩定健全\n\n在新一屆美國政府下，政策走向難以預料，並引致地緣經濟碎片化，因此預期全球經濟不明朗的情況應會在2025年持續。金管局肩負促進香港金融體系穩定健全的重任，將繼續提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，確保能掌握最新發展，並作好準備隨時為香港經濟提供支援。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n展望2025年，鑑於宏觀經濟環境不明朗，環球金融市場或會出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。我們亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，並評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n宏觀經濟環境的不確定性很可能會對銀行體系帶來挑戰。與此同時，數碼化的持續發展及生成式人工智能(GenAI)等創新科技的應用，既帶來眾多好處，亦不免為銀行增添新的業務操作與科技風險。面對上述環境，金管局將致力於透過提供政策與實務指引，以及與個別銀行以至整體業界的持續監管聯繫與溝通，進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會因應科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準與最佳做法，繼續加強及改進銀行規管架構與監管模式。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在信貸環境面臨壓力下，金管局將繼續重點監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估它們的信用風險管理手法的成效，特別是涉及貸款分類與撥備，以及問題貸款管理等範疇。同時，我們會與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，並鼓勵認可機構在維持審慎信用風險管理的首要原則下，繼續支持實體經濟。\n\n主要先進經濟體利率前景不明朗及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫，致使環球金融市場更趨波動，有見及此，金管局會繼續採取主動，監管認可機構的市場風險管理。因應宏觀經濟環境不明朗，以及銀行服務日益數碼化，我們亦會審視認可機構如何管理流動性風險，以加強它們應付突發性資金流的能力。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n金管局會繼續其提升銀行體系整體運作穩健性的工作，審視銀行在識別維持關鍵運作的潛在風險並作出補救方面的進度，以作為其實施運作穩健性架構的其中一部分。\n\n鑑於銀行業日益倚賴第三方服務供應商，金管局會進一步加強銀行對第三方風險的管理，制定新指引以實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所制定的相關國際標準。\n\n在網絡防衛韌性方面，金管局會透過跨界別的「網絡地圖」項目評估系統性網絡風險。該項目正由金管局聯同其他本地金融監管機構按照國際貨幣基金組織的建議共同推進。此外，我們將審視銀行實施「穩固三重數據備份」安排的情況及推出網絡防衛韌性測試框架，以推動銀行加強在遇到嚴峻網絡事故時恢復關鍵運作的能力。\n\n儘管我們留意到銀行業更廣泛採用GenAI等高端技術所帶來的好處，但亦會保持警覺，留意新生風險，並按需要就相關技術的運用提供指引。\n\n我們亦會與業界及其他相關持份者合作，保持機動應對，防患未然，以提升銀行打擊數碼詐騙及防範千變萬化的詐騙手法的能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2025年，金管局將推出制度改革、創新及其他措施，以提升香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈的整體能力、減低來自非法資金流的威脅，以及與最新的國際標準及最佳做法看齊。\n\n作為政府跨部門合作的一部分，我們將協助進行第三次香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的全面評估，以加深對科技發展所帶來的潛在弱點的了解，並根據評估結果制定有效且適度的指引，以配合新的穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。\n\n我們將會繼續在能帶來公眾價值的領域帶領及推廣負責任地應用科技，包括人工智能。相關工作包括加強可疑活動監察，讓銀行能識別及制止更多詐騙及傀儡戶口，從而進一步增加向執法機構提交的優質及有助作出跟進的情報。\n\n為加強打擊詐騙和其他金融罪行的力度，我們將提出所需的法例修訂建議，為銀行間分享個人戶口的訊息創造必要的途徑與保障。為加強偵測非法資金流的速度與數量，金管局將展開有關支付數據分析平台的工作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n在2025年，金管局會就認可機構在證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的操守進行現場及非現場審查。我們會重點留意高收益複雜產品、數碼資產及相關投資產品、「跨境理財通」業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，按需要就銷售證券、投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。為促進數碼資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，我們會繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為數碼資產行業制定穩健、周全和平衡的監管架構。\n\n此外，金管局會促進及監察業界實施「跨境理財通」優化措施的情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局聯繫，以進一步優化該計劃及其他銀行相關的跨境項目。\n\n我們亦會按需要整合及釐清有關財富管理及強積金相關業務的現行指引，讓業界更容易掌握金管局的監管規定，便利遵守。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案於2025年1月1日在香港生效。金管局將就最終改革方案在詮釋方面的常見問題持續向認可機構提供指引並加以釐清，以確保業界一致地採納該方案。\n\n巴塞爾委員會在2022年12月發出銀行審慎處理加密資產風險承擔的新標準，再於2024年7月發出具針對性修訂，進一步釐清穩定幣得到優惠監管待遇的準則。同時，巴塞爾委員會亦發表題為「加密資產風險承擔的披露」的文件，列載更新的加密資產風險承擔披露規定。為於香港實施相關標準，金管局會研究可能需要對《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）規則》、《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（《風險承擔限度規則》）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》等各套規則作出的法例修訂。金管局亦會因應實施經驗及業界回饋，對《風險承擔限度規則》提出若干優化建議。金管局將於2025年上半年就修訂進行法定諮詢，以能按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2026年1月1日實施新標準。金管局亦會制定相關銀行業申報表及輔助指引，以便利認可機構實施新標準。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為緊貼最新國際標準、監管方法及銀行業的發展，金管局計劃更新多個《監管政策手冊》單元，包括CA-G-5「監管審查程序」、CA-B-2「具系統重要性銀行」、IC-5「壓力測試」、IR-1「銀行帳內的利率風險」及IC-3「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」。《監管政策手冊》單元CR-G-13「對手方信用風險管理」會作出修訂，以反映巴塞爾委員會在2024年12月發出的「對手方信用風險管理指引」提出的穩健做法。\n\n# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\n\n巴塞爾委員會於2024年4月發出經修訂的《有效監管銀行業的主要原則》（《主要原則》）。經修訂《主要原則》反映自對上一次在2012年進行修訂以來監管與規管方面的發展，以及最近的結構性趨勢對銀行與銀行體系的影響。金管局將於2025年進行詳盡的自我評估，以確保其監管及規管架構符合經修訂《主要原則》。\n\n# 會計準則\n\n國際會計準則理事會計劃在2025年就動態風險管理(Dynamic Risk Management)發出徵求意見稿。金管局將與其他有關當局合作，就建議的動態風險管理會計模型對現行審慎監管規定的影響作出研究。\n\n# 執法\n\n金管局在2024年就擴大金融管理專員的調查及執法權力的建議諮詢銀行業，以確保他仍具備必要權力有效履行在《銀行業條例》下的職能。經考慮在諮詢中收到的意見後，金管局將調整有關建議，並制定必要的法例修訂，以進一步諮詢各持份者。\n\n# 處置機制\n\n金管局正繼續推行為期多年的項目，以建立運作暢順的認可機構處置機制。在2025年，金管局優先進行以下範疇的工作（表1）：\n\n表1 2025年處置機制的工作重點\n\n# 處置政策及標準\n\n- 就有關金管局對處置中的估值採取的方法，以及認可機構為支持適時穩健的處置估值而須具備的事前能力及安排的《實務守則》篇章進行諮詢，並完成相關制定工作\n- 推進制定處置重組的政策標準的工作\n\n# 國際及跨境合作\n\n- 參與國際處置政策發展及有效實施方面的工作，尤其金融穩定理事會透過轄下的處置機制督導小組及各工作小組計劃於2025年進行的12項處置機制改革措施\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management 321"],"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"US policy rate,\" \"inbound tourism,\" \"economic stimulus measures,\" \"inflation,\" and \"financial system.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence flow that affect the overall quality and naturalness of the English translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning of the original text.\n- They all use the required dictionary terms correctly.\n- The sentence structures are mostly clear and grammatically sound.\n- The translations are fluent and natural, with only minor stylistic differences.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"coupled with the upward risks facing inflation\" (Translation 2) or \"the risk of inflation rising\" (Translation 3), which are less idiomatic than \"rising inflation risks\" or \"upward risks to inflation.\"\n- Some translations use \"the mainland China\" or \"Mainland China\" inconsistently (e.g., Translation 4 uses \"China's mainland\" and \"Mainland China\").\n- Some translations use \"supportive measures\" or \"support measures\" (e.g., Translation 5), which are acceptable but not as precise as \"support measures\" or \"supporting measures.\"\n- The phrase \"long-established resilient capacity\" (Translation 4) is slightly awkward compared to \"robust resilience built up over the years\" (Translation 1).\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more idiomatic expressions such as \"rising inflation risks\" or \"upward risks to inflation.\"\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Mainland China\" or \"mainland China\" without unnecessary articles.\n- Use \"support measures\" or \"supporting measures\" consistently.\n- Use more natural phrasing for the financial system's resilience, such as \"robust resilience built up over the years\" or \"long-established resilience.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe best possible translation would combine the strengths of all the translations, using the most natural and idiomatic phrasing while ensuring consistency and accuracy in terminology.\n---\nThe global economic outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, with significant uncertainty surrounding U.S. economic and trade policies, compounded by upward risks to inflation, leading to market concerns about the future direction of the U.S. policy rate. At the same time, following the announcement and gradual implementation of economic stimulus measures by mainland China, market sentiment in both mainland China and Hong Kong has improved, and the various support measures introduced by the government should further enhance inbound tourism. Hong Kong's financial system, bolstered by its robust resilience built up over the years and ample buffers, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"macroeconomic environment,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"liquidity,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"financial system.\" The translations are consistent in meaning and convey the intended message of the original text.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and professional tone, appropriate for an official statement.\n- Good sentence structure and fluency in English.\n- Consistent use of formal language, suitable for the context of a government or regulatory body.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Minor variations in phrasing, such as \"strive to promote,\" \"dedicate itself to promoting,\" or \"strive for,\" which are all acceptable but may be refined for consistency.\n- Some translations use \"defensive arrangements\" or \"defensive deployments,\" which are both acceptable, but \"defensive preparations\" may be more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"create policy space\" is used consistently and effectively.\n- The use of \"ensure that the Exchange Fund can continue to effectively maintain monetary and financial stability\" is slightly repetitive in some translations and could be streamlined.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use the required terminology accurately, and ensure clarity and fluency. It should avoid redundancy and use natural phrasing that aligns with official communication.\nThe improved translation would aim to balance consistency, clarity, and natural English expression, ensuring that the message is both precise and accessible.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA will continue to strive to promote the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and infrastructure. Faced with an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, striving to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, we will actively seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund prudently and flexibly. We will make appropriate defensive preparations and maintain high liquidity, while continuing to diversify investments to strive for higher long-term returns on the Exchange Fund, ensuring that it can continue to effectively maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Stable and Sound Financial System\n\nUnder the new U.S. administration, policy direction is difficult to predict and is leading to geo-economic fragmentation, therefore the expectation is that global economic uncertainty will persist into 2025. The HKMA shoulders the important responsibility of promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system in Hong Kong, and will continue to heighten vigilance, guard against various potential risks, ensure it grasps the latest developments, and be prepared to provide support to the Hong Kong economy at any time.\n\n# Stay alert to potential risks  \nStay Alert to Potential Risks  \nStay Vigilant About Potential Risks  \nRemain vigilant about potential risks.  \nBe vigilant about potential risks.  \nStay alert to potential risks  \nAll translations are very close to the original text and convey the intended meaning accurately. However, there are some minor differences in tone and formality. \"Stay alert\" is more casual, while \"Stay vigilant\" is more formal. \"Remain vigilant\" is also formal but slightly more passive. \"Be vigilant\" is a direct imperative. The use of a hashtag (#) in translations 2 and 6 is unnecessary unless the context specifically requires it. Given that the original text does not include a hashtag, it is best to omit it. The most natural and balanced translation would be \"Stay alert to potential risks\" as it is concise, clear, and maintains the original tone.\nStay alert to potential risks\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"monetary and financial systems\" for \"貨幣及金融體系,\" adhering to the dictionary requirements.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"take appropriate measures as needed\" is a strong and natural phrasing that appears in multiple translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Instability factors\" vs. \"instabilities\"**: Some translations use \"instability factors\" (e.g., translations 2, 3, 4, 6), while others use \"instabilities\" (e.g., translations 1, 5). \"Instabilities\" is more concise and commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **\"Destabilizing factors\"**: Translation 2 and 3 use \"destabilizing factors,\" which is slightly more active and may imply a more direct cause-effect relationship than the original text suggests.\n- **\"Matters\" vs. \"issues\"**: Translations 1, 2, 3, 5 use \"matters,\" while translations 4 and 6 use \"issues.\" \"Matters\" is more neutral and formal, which aligns better with the tone of the original text.\n- **\"May affect\" vs. \"affect\"**: Translations 1 and 3 use \"may affect,\" which adds a layer of uncertainty, while translations 2, 4, 5, 6 use \"affect\" directly. The original Chinese uses \"有影響\" (have an impact), which is more definitive than \"may affect.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"instabilities\" instead of \"instability factors\" for consistency and conciseness.\n- Use \"matters\" instead of \"issues\" to maintain the formal tone.\n- Use \"affect\" without \"may\" to reflect the definitive nature of the original statement.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of \"HKMA\" (e.g., translations 4 and 6 start with \"HKMA\" without \"The,\" which is less formal and less consistent with the others).\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and instabilities in both local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems. We will also study matters that affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintaining Banking Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"macroeconomic environment,\" \"HKMA,\" \"supervisory engagement,\" \"banking sector\/system,\" \"international standards and best practices,\" \"regulatory frameworks,\" and \"supervisory approaches.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure that mirrors the original Chinese.\n- Proper use of formal and professional language appropriate for a regulatory context.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"banking sector\" while others use \"banking system.\" The original Chinese uses \"銀行體系,\" which is more accurately translated as \"banking system\" in this context, referring to the entire system of banks and their interconnections.\n- The phrase \"in response to the above environment\" is repeated in several translations. While grammatically correct, it can be made more natural by using alternatives such as \"faced with the aforementioned environment\" or \"in light of the above environment.\"\n- The use of \"maintaining continuous supervisory engagement\" is slightly repetitive and could be rephrased for better flow.\n- Some translations use \"enhance the ability of banks to withstand various shocks,\" which is correct but could be more concise as \"enhance banks’ resilience to various shocks.\"\n- The phrase \"in line with technological developments\" is slightly less natural than \"in response to technological developments.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translators' work while refining the phrasing for greater fluency and naturalness in English.\nFinal Translation:\nThe uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the ongoing development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits but also introduce new operational and technological risks for banks. Faced with the aforementioned environment, the HKMA will strive to enhance banks’ resilience to various shocks through providing policy and practical guidance, as well as maintaining continuous supervisory engagement and communication with individual banks and the broader industry. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen and improve the regulatory frameworks and supervisory approaches for banks in response to technological developments, changes in customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Supervisory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nUnder pressure from the credit environment, the HKMA will continue to focus on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly in areas involving loan classification and provisions, as well as problem loan management. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, and encourage authorized institutions to continue supporting the real economy while maintaining the principle of prudent credit risk management as a priority.\nThis translation integrates the strengths of the junior translators' versions while refining for fluency and precision. It uses \"authorized institutions\" consistently, as it is the more formal and commonly used term in regulatory contexts. The phrase \"maintaining the principle of prudent credit risk management as a priority\" captures the nuance of the original Chinese, which emphasizes the primacy of this principle. The use of \"at the same time\" and \"while\" ensures smooth transitions between the two main points of the sentence. The structure is clear, professional, and aligns with the tone expected in official regulatory communications.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"authorized institutions,\" \"market risk,\" \"liquidity risk,\" and others. However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and use the required dictionary terms.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the logical flow of the message.\n- The use of terms like \"proactive approach,\" \"review,\" and \"enhance their ability\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly less idiomatic expressions, such as \"take the initiative in regulating\" (Translation 5) or \"take an active role in overseeing\" (Translation 4), which are correct but not as commonly used in formal policy statements.\n- The phrase \"take a proactive approach\" (used in Translations 1, 2, and 3) is more standard in regulatory and financial contexts than \"take the initiative\" or \"take an active role.\"\n- The use of \"AIs\" (authorized institutions) in Translation 6 is acceptable but less formal than \"authorized institutions\" in other translations.\n- The phrase \"handle sudden fund flows\" (used in Translations 4 and 5) is slightly less precise than \"cope with sudden fund flows\" or \"deal with sudden fund flows.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"take a proactive approach\" as it is the most standard and formal expression in this context.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" consistently for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"cope with sudden fund flows\" for precision and naturalness.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and avoids redundancy, such as \"in light of this\" or \"given this.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe uncertain interest rate outlook in major advanced economies, combined with escalating geopolitical tensions, has led to increased volatility in global financial markets. In light of this, the HKMA will continue to take a proactive approach to overseeing market risk management at authorized institutions. In response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitalization of banking services, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risk to strengthen their ability to cope with sudden fund flows.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\nThe original text is a heading, likely for a document or section discussing risks related to business operations and technology. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with slight differences in capitalization, punctuation, and the use of \"Risks\" versus \"Risk.\"\nThe first and third translations use \"Risks\" with a plural form, which is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to multiple potential risks. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use the singular \"Risk,\" which may be less accurate unless the context specifically refers to a single, overarching risk. The fifth translation uses lowercase, which is less formal and less suitable for a heading.\nThe best translation should be consistent with standard English heading conventions, use the plural form \"Risks\" to reflect multiple potential risks, and maintain proper capitalization. Therefore, \"Business Operations and Technology Risks\" is the most appropriate translation.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to enhance the operational resilience of the banking sector, specifically by reviewing banks' progress in identifying and addressing risks to critical operations as part of implementing an operational resilience framework.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Accurately uses \"banking system\" and \"operational resilience framework.\" However, it omits \"maintaining\" before \"critical operations,\" which slightly weakens the nuance of the original.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"banking sector\" and includes \"maintaining critical operations,\" which is closer to the original. It also includes \"corrective actions,\" which is a good match for \"作出補救.\" However, it uses \"their\" instead of \"its\" when referring to the HKMA's implementation, which is a minor grammatical error.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"banking sector\" and \"remedial measures,\" which is a valid synonym for \"作出補救.\" However, it uses \"their\" instead of \"its\" again, and \"operational resilience framework\" is used in the singular, which is acceptable but less precise than the plural in the original.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"banking sector\" and \"remedial actions,\" and correctly uses \"its\" for the HKMA. It also uses \"operational resilience frameworks\" in the plural, which aligns with the original's use of \"架構\" (framework). However, it uses \"their\" for the banks' implementation, which is slightly inconsistent.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"banking sector,\" \"maintaining critical operations,\" and \"corrective actions.\" It correctly uses \"its\" for the HKMA and \"operational resilience framework\" in the singular. This is a strong translation with only minor improvements possible.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Similar to the fifth, but uses \"remedial actions\" instead of \"corrective actions.\" It also uses \"its\" consistently and \"operational resilience framework\" in the singular. This is also a strong translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"banking sector\" as it is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- Include \"maintaining critical operations\" to reflect the original's emphasis on sustaining essential functions.\n- Use \"corrective actions\" or \"remedial actions\" as both are acceptable, but \"corrective actions\" is slightly more formal and precise in this context.\n- Use \"its\" consistently when referring to the HKMA's implementation.\n- Use \"operational resilience framework\" in the singular, as the original uses \"架構\" (framework), which is singular.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue its work to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking sector, reviewing banks' progress in identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations and taking corrective actions, as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, all junior translators have produced fluent and grammatically correct translations that accurately reflect the meaning of the original Chinese. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and structure that can be refined for clarity and conciseness.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms: \"third-party service providers,\" \"HKMA,\" \"third-party risks,\" and \"Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).\"\n- Accurate conveyance of the main idea: the HKMA is strengthening banks' management of third-party risks through new guidelines aligned with Basel standards.\n- Consistent use of formal and professional language appropriate for regulatory texts.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The use of \"formulate\" versus \"develop\" for the guidelines: \"develop\" is more commonly used in regulatory and policy contexts for creating guidelines.\n- The phrase \"by developing new guidelines\" (used in translations 4 and 6) is slightly more concise than \"and develop new guidelines.\"\n- The use of \"banking sector\" versus \"banking industry\" is interchangeable, but \"banking industry\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- The inclusion of \"(Basel Committee)\" after the full name is optional but adds clarity and is used in translations 1, 3, and 4.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"banking industry,\" \"develop,\" and include the \"(Basel Committee)\" parenthetical for clarity.\nFinal translation:\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking industry on third-party service providers, the HKMA will further strengthen banks' management of third-party risks by developing new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six junior translations are largely accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. \nThe first junior translator uses \"cross-sectoral 'Cyber Mapping exercise' project\" and \"in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund,\" which are both accurate. However, the phrase \"advanced by the HKMA in collaboration with\" is slightly less fluid than \"jointly advanced by.\"\nThe second junior translator uses \"cross-sectoral 'Cyber Mapping' project\" without the word \"exercise,\" which is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary entry that specifies \"Cyber Mapping exercise.\" The phrase \"in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund\" is also accurate.\nThe third junior translator uses \"Cyber Mapping exercise\" without quotation marks, which is acceptable but less precise than using quotation marks as in the dictionary. The phrase \"in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund\" is accurate and well-phrased.\nThe fourth junior translator uses \"robust tertiary data backup\" instead of \"tertiary data backup,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be misleading. The phrase \"in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund\" is accurate.\nThe fifth junior translator uses \"suggestions\" instead of \"recommendations,\" which is a minor but notable deviation from the dictionary. The use of \"facing severe cyber incidents\" is slightly less formal than \"in the event of severe cyber incidents.\"\nThe sixth junior translator uses \"the IMF's recommendations\" instead of \"the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund,\" which is acceptable but less formal. It also uses \"robust tertiary data backup,\" which is not in the dictionary.\nThe best translation would retain the exact terminology from the dictionary, use consistent phrasing, and ensure grammatical precision and fluency. It should use \"Cyber Mapping exercise\" with quotation marks, \"in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund,\" and \"tertiary data backup\" without the word \"robust.\"\nIn terms of structure, the sentence about reviewing the implementation of \"tertiary data backup\" arrangements and introducing a \"cyber resilience testing framework\" should be concise and clear, using active voice where appropriate.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nIn terms of cyber resilience, the HKMA will assess systemic cyber risks through the cross-sectoral \"Cyber Mapping exercise.\" This initiative is being jointly advanced by the HKMA and other local financial regulators in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, we will review the implementation of \"tertiary data backup\" arrangements by banks and introduce a cyber resilience testing framework to enhance banks' ability to restore critical operations in the event of severe cyber incidents.\n\nWhile all six translations are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality. Here's a critical review:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and grammatically sound, but \"acknowledge\" feels slightly formal and less dynamic than \"note\" or \"recognize\" in this context. It also uses \"application of these technologies\" which is slightly wordy.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"noted\" and \"keep an eye on,\" which are more conversational and natural. However, \"keep an eye on\" is slightly informal compared to \"monitor\" or \"remain vigilant.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the original in structure but uses \"paying attention to\" and \"providing guidance\" in the same clause, which makes the sentence feel less polished and slightly awkward.\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and natural, using \"monitor\" and \"provide guidance on the use of such technologies.\" The use of \"monitor\" is more precise than \"keep an eye on\" or \"pay attention to.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to 4, but uses \"such technologies\" instead of \"these technologies,\" which is slightly more natural in this context.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"despite recognizing\" which is slightly less direct than \"although we recognize\" or \"although we have noted.\" It is still grammatically correct but slightly less dynamic.\n**Reasoning for improvement:** The best translation should use natural, fluent English while maintaining the formal tone appropriate for a statement about banking and technology. \"Recognize\" is more active than \"acknowledge\" or \"note.\" \"Monitor\" is more precise than \"keep an eye on\" or \"pay attention to.\" \"Such technologies\" is more natural than \"these technologies\" in this context. The structure should be clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAlthough we recognize the benefits brought about by the broader adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI in the banking sector, we will remain vigilant, monitor emerging risks, and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other relevant stakeholders to remain agile and proactive in preventing issues, thereby enhancing banks' ability to combat digital fraud and guard against ever-changing fraud tactics.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counterfinancing of Terrorism\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will introduce institutional reforms, innovations, and other measures to enhance Hong Kong's overall capability in the anti-money laundering and counterfinancing of terrorism ecosystem, reduce threats from illicit fund flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of government cross-departmental collaboration, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong, to deepen our understanding of potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidance in line with the implementation of the new regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that deliver public value. This work includes strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activities, enabling banks to identify and stop more fraud and mule accounts, thereby further increasing the quality and usefulness of information submitted to law-enforcement bodies for follow-up actions.\n\nTo strengthen efforts to combat fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendments to create the required pathways and safeguards for bank-to-bank information sharing. To enhance the speed and volume of detecting illicit fund flows, the HKMA will initiate work on an analytics platform for payments data.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Related Services\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will conduct on-site and off-site reviews of the conduct of authorized institutions in relation to securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses. We will focus on high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long term insurance products, and premium financing activities, and will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"MPF,\" \"supervision framework,\" \"DA sector,\" and \"fellow regulators.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, verb choice, and preposition usage that affect fluency and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of \"fellow regulators\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The term \"DA sector\" is used correctly in all translations.\n- The phrase \"robust, comprehensive, and balanced supervision framework\" is well-chosen and consistent across most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"coordinate\" instead of \"maintain close contact\" or \"maintain close communication,\" which is slightly less natural in this context.\n- The fourth translation uses \"digital asset industry\" instead of \"DA sector,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be less precise.\n- The second and sixth translations use \"fellow regulators\" consistently, which is preferable to \"other regulators\" for maintaining a more formal and consistent tone.\n- The use of \"as needed\" is slightly more natural than \"as needed\" in some contexts, but all translations are acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"maintain close communication\" for a more formal and natural tone.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"fellow regulators\" throughout the translation.\n- Use \"DA sector\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"collaborate\" or \"work with\" for a more natural and formal tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA will also maintain close communication with fellow regulators and the banking sector, providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investments, insurance, and MPF products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the DA sector, we will continue to collaborate with the government and fellow regulators to ensure the establishment of a robust, comprehensive, and balanced supervision framework for the DA sector.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA will promote and monitor the implementation of optimization measures for the Wealth Management Connect, and will continue to liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to further optimize the scheme and other cross-border banking initiatives.\n\nWe will also integrate and clarify the existing guidelines related to wealth management and MPF-related businesses as needed, enabling the industry to better understand HKMA's regulatory requirements and facilitating compliance.\n\n# Formulate Policy\n\n# Implementation of the Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe original text discusses the implementation of the Basel III reform package in Hong Kong and the role of the HKMA in providing guidance to authorized institutions. The translations by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" and either \"authorized institutions\" or \"AIs\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The core message is preserved in all translations: the Basel III reform package becomes effective in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025, and the HKMA will provide guidance and clarification to ensure consistent adoption by the industry.\n- Most translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"final reform package\" and \"consistent adoption by the industry,\" which are clear but slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"AIs\" and \"clarify them,\" which is slightly awkward and repetitive.\n- **Translation 3** is concise but lacks specificity in the role of the HKMA, using \"provide guidance and clarify common issues\" without specifying the target audience.\n- **Translation 4** is clear but uses \"the industry adopts the plan consistently,\" which is slightly less formal than \"ensure consistent adoption by the industry.\"\n- **Translation 5** is well-structured and uses \"AIs\" appropriately, but \"common issues in the interpretation\" is slightly less precise than \"common interpretive issues.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"final reform\" instead of \"final reform package,\" which is less precise than the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"final reform package\" to match the original text's specificity.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"provide guidance and clarify common interpretive issues\" is used to maintain precision and clarity.\n- Use \"ensure consistent adoption by the industry\" to maintain parallel structure and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe final reform package of Basel III will take effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The HKMA will continue to provide guidance to authorized institutions and clarify common interpretive issues regarding the final reform package to ensure consistent adoption by the industry.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Basel Committee,\" \"HKMA,\" \"cryptoasset exposures,\" \"preferential regulatory treatment,\" and \"BELR.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations accurately reflect the timeline and the procedural steps taken by the HKMA.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"Banking (Liquidity) Rules\" being mentioned twice in one version.\n- **Ambiguity in Rule Names:** Some translations incorrectly refer to \"Banking (Risk Limitation) Rules\" or \"Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules\" instead of \"Banking (Risk Limit) Rules (BELR),\" which is the correct term from the dictionary.\n- **Inconsistent Terminology:** Some translations use \"AIs\" while others use \"authorized institutions,\" which should be consistent.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations sound overly literal or awkward, such as \"the HKMA will study the legislative changes that may be needed to various rules,\" which could be more naturally phrased.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the exact dictionary terms consistently, especially for \"Banking (Risk Limit) Rules (BELR).\"\n- Ensure that \"AIs\" and \"authorized institutions\" are used consistently.\n- Improve sentence flow and eliminate redundancy.\n- Use more natural phrasing to enhance readability.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards for the prudent management of cryptoasset exposures in December 2022 and subsequently issued targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. At the same time, the Basel Committee published a document titled \"Disclosure of cryptoasset exposures,\" outlining updated disclosure requirements for cryptoasset exposures. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, the HKMA will study the potential legislative amendments required to the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Liquidity) Rules, and the Banking (Risk Limit) Rules (BELR). The HKMA will also propose several optimization suggestions for the BELR based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will conduct statutory consultation on the revisions in the first half of 2025, in order to implement the new standards by January 1, 2026, in line with the Basel Committee’s timeline. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking returns and supporting guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the new standards by authorized institutions.\n\n# Other Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches, and developments in the banking industry, the HKMA plans to update several units of the Supervisory Policy Manual, including CA-G-5 \"Supervisory Review Process,\" CA-B-2 \"Systemically Important Banks,\" IC-5 \"Stress-testing,\" IR-1 \"Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book,\" and IC-3 \"Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance.\" The Supervisory Policy Manual unit CR-G-13 \"Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" will be revised to reflect the sound practices outlined in the Basel Committee’s \"Guidelines for counterparty credit risk management\" issued in December 2024.\n\n# Basel Committee's Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"BCP,\" and \"Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.\" However, there are subtle variations in the use of terms like \"regulatory frameworks\" versus \"supervisory and regulatory frameworks,\" and in the choice of adjectives such as \"thorough,\" \"detailed,\" \"comprehensive,\" and \"aligned,\" \"in line with,\" \"consistent with,\" and \"comply with.\"\nTranslation 1 is concise and accurate, using \"regulatory frameworks\" and \"aligned with.\" Translation 2 adds \"supervisory\" to \"regulatory and supervisory frameworks,\" which is slightly more comprehensive but not incorrect. Translation 3 uses \"regulatory frameworks are in line with,\" which is natural and accurate. Translation 4 uses \"supervisory and regulatory frameworks\" and \"consistent with,\" which is also correct. Translation 5 uses \"comprehensive\" and \"comply with,\" which are slightly more formal. Translation 6 has a minor grammatical error (\"reflect\" should be \"reflects\") and uses \"banking sector\" instead of \"banking system,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this context.\nThe best translation would combine the strengths of these versions: using \"supervisory and regulatory frameworks\" to capture both aspects, \"comprehensive\" to convey the thoroughness of the self-assessment, and \"comply with\" to reflect the formal requirement of alignment with the BCP.\n---\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised *Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision* (BCP) in April 2024. The revised BCP reflects developments in regulation and supervision since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The HKMA will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its supervisory and regulatory frameworks comply with the revised BCP.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and word choice that affect fluency and precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Accuracy and Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms. \"HKMA,\" \"International Accounting Standards Board,\" \"Exposure Draft,\" \"DRM,\" \"DRM accounting model,\" and \"prudential requirements\" are all used appropriately.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically correct. However, the use of \"collaborate\" versus \"cooperate\" is a minor stylistic choice. \"Collaborate\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in regulatory and institutional contexts, making it more appropriate here.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The phrase \"issue an Exposure Draft on Dynamic Risk Management\" is slightly more direct than \"issue an Exposure Draft regarding Dynamic Risk Management.\" The preposition \"on\" is more commonly used in regulatory and policy contexts when referring to the subject of a draft.\n4. **Consistency**: The first, third, and fourth translations include \"(DRM)\" after \"Dynamic Risk Management,\" which adds clarity and is consistent with the dictionary entry that lists both \"DRM\" and \"Dynamic Risk Management\" as acceptable translations. This is a minor but helpful addition for clarity.\n5. **Punctuation and Style**: The fourth translation uses \"regarding\" instead of \"on,\" which is slightly less direct. The first, third, and fourth translations are more consistent in their phrasing and punctuation.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an Exposure Draft on Dynamic Risk Management (DRM) in 2025. The HKMA will collaborate with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed DRM accounting model on existing prudential requirements.\n\n# Law Enforcement\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"banking industry\" and \"legislative changes,\" both of which are acceptable. However, \"formulate the necessary legislative changes\" is slightly awkward compared to \"prepare the necessary legislative amendments.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version uses \"banking sector\" and \"legislative amendments,\" which are appropriate. However, the use of \"he\" to refer to the Monetary Authority is incorrect, as the Monetary Authority is an institution, not a person. This is a significant grammatical and stylistic error.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"banking sector,\" \"legislative amendments,\" and \"formulate necessary legislative amendments.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"formulate\" with \"legislative amendments,\" which is slightly less common than \"prepare\" or \"draft.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is similar to the third, but it uses \"proposed measures\" instead of \"proposals,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"all stakeholders,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"banking industry,\" \"legislative amendments,\" and \"revise the proposals,\" which is a natural choice. The only minor issue is the use of \"views\" instead of \"feedback,\" which is slightly less direct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very fluent and natural. It uses \"banking sector,\" \"legislative amendments,\" and \"refine the proposals,\" which is a more precise term than \"adjust\" or \"revise.\" The use of \"retains\" is also more natural than \"possesses\" or \"has.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- \"Banking sector\" is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"banking industry.\"\n- \"Legislative amendments\" is the more precise term from the dictionary.\n- \"Refine the proposals\" is more natural and precise than \"adjust\" or \"revise.\"\n- \"Retains\" is a more natural and concise choice than \"possesses\" or \"has.\"\n- \"Prepare the necessary legislative amendments\" is more natural than \"formulate\" or \"draft.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the third, fifth, and sixth translations, using the most natural and precise language.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA consulted the banking sector in 2024 on proposals to expand the Monetary Authority’s investigative and enforcement powers to ensure it retains the necessary powers to effectively perform its functions under the Banking Ordinance. Having considered the feedback received during the consultation, the HKMA will refine the proposals and prepare the necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Resolution Regime\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continuing a long-term project to establish an operational resolution regime, with a focus on key areas of work in 2025. The dictionary specifies that \"運作暢順的認可機構處置機制\" must be translated as \"operational resolution regime\" and \"金管局\" as \"HKMA.\"\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"continuing to advance\" which is natural, and correctly uses \"operational resolution regime.\" However, it omits \"authorized institutions\" which is part of the original phrase, though it may be implied.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"continuing\" without \"to advance,\" which is slightly more concise but still correct. It correctly uses the term from the dictionary and maintains the structure of the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation includes \"authorized institutions,\" which is not in the dictionary, but it is part of the original phrase. However, the dictionary only specifies \"運作暢順的認可機構處置機制\" as \"operational resolution regime,\" so adding \"for authorized institutions\" may be unnecessary unless it is part of the official term. The use of \"prioritizes\" is slightly less formal than \"will prioritize.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"long-term project\" instead of \"multi-year project,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise. It also includes \"for authorized institutions,\" which is not in the dictionary. The use of \"prioritize work in the following areas\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes \"authorized institutions,\" which may be redundant based on the dictionary. It uses \"implement\" instead of \"advance\" or \"continue,\" which is acceptable but slightly more active than the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is similar to the fifth but omits \"authorized institutions,\" which is better in line with the dictionary. It uses \"implement\" and \"will prioritize,\" which are both acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural. It should use the exact terms from the dictionary and avoid adding unnecessary information. \"Multi-year project\" is more precise than \"long-term project.\" \"Continuing to advance\" is slightly more active than \"continuing\" alone. \"Will prioritize\" is more formal and appropriate for official contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is continuing to advance a multi-year project to establish an operational resolution regime. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritize work in the following areas (Table 1):\n\nTable 1 Key Work Priorities of the 2025 Resolution Regime\n\n# Disposal Policies and Standards\n\n- Consult on the Code of Practice chapter regarding the approach taken by the HKMA for resolution valuations, and the ex-ante capabilities and arrangements that authorized institutions must have to support timely and prudent resolution valuations, and complete the related drafting work  \n- Advance the development of policy standards for resolution restructuring\n\n# International and cross-border cooperation\nThe original text is a heading, \"國際及跨境合作,\" which translates to \"International and Cross-Border Cooperation.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with differences in capitalization and punctuation.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use lowercase for \"cross-border,\" which is acceptable in headings but less formal. The second, fifth, and fourth translations capitalize \"Cross-Border,\" which is more appropriate for a heading. The fourth and fifth translations also include the \"#\" symbol, which may be used to denote a section heading in certain formatting contexts, but it is not part of the original text and should be omitted unless explicitly required.\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and stylistically appropriate for a heading. It should use title case for the heading and avoid unnecessary symbols. Therefore, the most suitable translation is \"International and Cross-Border Cooperation.\"\n\nParticipate in work related to the development and effective implementation of international resolution policies, particularly the Financial Stability Board's planned 12 reforms to the resolution regime to be carried out by 2025 through its Resolution Steering Group and various working groups.\n"}

金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授予金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全（惟同時須顧及外匯基金的主要目的），藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》訂明金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。金融管理專員獲賦予一系列權力，對不可持續經營的銀行界實體進行有秩序處置（有關實體倒閉可能構成系統性風險），以維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n保險業監管局根據《保險業條例》就銀行的保險相關業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》授權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例下有關客戶盡職審查及備存紀錄的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付的持牌銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察某些重要的結算及交收系統，以及在香港營運的零售支付系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理用作儲存金錢價值並符合該條例指明準則的電子及實物「工具」的發牌制度。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

structure. All correctly identify \"香港金融管理局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"香港的中央銀行機構\" as \"Hong Kong’s central banking institution,\" adhering to the dictionary specifications. The only variation lies in the choice of adjectives to describe the functions: \"main\" versus \"primary.\" Both are grammatically correct and convey similar meanings, though \"primary\" may imply a slight emphasis on the importance of these functions.\nThe translations are fluent, grammatically sound, and culturally appropriate. However, they all follow the same structure and wording, which may suggest a lack of diversity in the junior translators' approaches. To improve the translation, one could consider slight variations in phrasing to enhance readability and avoid repetition, while still maintaining accuracy and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the correct terminology and use \"primary\" to emphasize the significance of the functions, as it is slightly more formal and precise in this context.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution, with four primary functions:\n\n- Maintain currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;  \n- Promote the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking sector);  \n- Assist in strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and  \n- Manage the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA's Legal Mandate\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but the phrase \"(formerly the Legislative Council)\" is redundant and confusing. Also, \"Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Secretary)\" is incorrect and redundant. The term \"Monetary Authority\" is correctly used, and \"HKMA\" is properly substituted.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the correct version. The use of \"amended provisions\" is appropriate, and \"subsequently\" is a good choice. However, the phrase \"(formerly known as the Legislative Council)\" is still redundant and could be simplified.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate, but it incorrectly uses \"Financial Commissioner\" instead of \"Financial Secretary\" in the parenthetical. This is a critical error, as the dictionary specifies \"Financial Secretary\" as the correct term.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"revised\" instead of \"amended,\" which is acceptable. The parenthetical \"(formerly known as the Financial Secretary)\" is correct, and \"then\" is a natural choice for the temporal transition.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation contains two significant errors: it uses \"Legislative Assembly\" instead of \"Legislative Council\" and \"Financial Comptroller\" instead of \"Financial Secretary.\" These are both incorrect based on the dictionary and the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the correct version. It avoids redundancy in the parenthetical and uses \"amendments\" correctly. However, the phrase \"the amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance\" is slightly awkward compared to \"amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"Legislative Council\" should not be redundantly repeated in the parenthetical.\n- \"Financial Secretary\" must be used consistently, as per the dictionary.\n- \"Monetary Authority\" is the correct term for \"金融管理專員.\"\n- \"HKMA\" should be used as the abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- The phrase \"amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance\" is more natural than \"revised Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n- The use of \"subsequently\" or \"then\" is appropriate for the temporal transition.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be concise, accurate, and fluent, using the correct terminology and avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Assembly) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Comptroller) to appoint the Monetary Authority. The HKMA was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"HKMA\" for \"金管局.\" The use of \"Ordinances\" (with or without capitalization) is consistent with the dictionary entry for \"條例.\"\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and grammatically correct sentence structures.\n- Proper handling of legal and formal language.\n- Correct identification of the date format (25 June 2003) and the reference to the HKMA website.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"explicitly stipulated\" or \"expressly provided for,\" which are all acceptable, but \"explicitly stipulated\" is slightly more formal and precise in a legal context.\n- The phrase \"exchange of letters\" is used consistently, but \"mutual letter\" or \"letter of exchange\" may be less common in formal legal English.\n- The phrase \"discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers\" is slightly awkward; \"reveals\" or \"outlines\" may be more natural.\n- The use of \"the aforementioned letter\" or \"the relevant letters\" is acceptable, but \"the letters\" is more direct and concise.\nImprovements could include:\n- Using \"explicitly stipulated\" for consistency and formality.\n- Using \"the exchange of letters\" as the most standard phrasing.\n- Using \"outlines\" or \"details\" instead of \"discloses\" for smoother flow.\n- Using \"the letters\" instead of \"the aforementioned letters\" or \"the relevant letters\" for conciseness.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions, using precise legal terminology, clear structure, and natural phrasing.\n---\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are explicitly stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 outlines the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also reveals that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be accessed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. The use of \"controlled by\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. However, \"monetary and financial system\" is slightly redundant, as \"financial system\" already implies monetary aspects.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the only notable difference being the use of \"integrity\" instead of \"soundness.\" While both are acceptable, \"soundness\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is nearly identical to the first, with no significant improvements or errors. It is a solid translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The phrase \"exercises control by the Financial Secretary\" is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It should be \"is controlled by the Financial Secretary.\" Additionally, \"mainly\" is less formal than \"primarily,\" which is more appropriate in legal or official contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"holds control over it\" which is slightly more formal and precise. It also uses \"preserving\" instead of \"maintaining,\" which is a subtle but elegant variation. However, it omits \"monetary\" from \"monetary and financial system,\" which may be a minor oversight.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is also very good. It uses \"in accordance with\" instead of \"under,\" which is slightly more formal. It also uses \"should primarily be used\" instead of \"must primarily be used,\" which is a more flexible phrasing that still conveys the intended meaning.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"In accordance with\" is more formal and appropriate for legal texts.\n- \"Maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system\" is more concise and avoids redundancy.\n- \"Preserving\" is a more elegant alternative to \"maintaining\" in the final clause.\n- \"Primary objective\" is slightly more formal than \"primary purpose,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund was established in accordance with the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund should primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system (while also considering the Exchange Fund's primary objective), thereby preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial center.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and precision of terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but the phrase “the functions assigned by other Ordinances and by the Financial Secretary” is slightly awkward. It should be “other Ordinances and by the Financial Secretary” to maintain parallel structure.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, but the phrase “other Ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary” is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as “other Ordinances and [other] functions,” which is not the intended meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The phrase “to exercise other Ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary” is grammatically incorrect. “Exercise” cannot be applied to “Ordinances,” which are legal documents, not functions.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The phrase “in exercising other Ordinances and functions delegated by the Financial Secretary” is also grammatically incorrect for the same reason as above. “Exercise” is not applicable to “Ordinances.”\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most fluent and grammatically correct of the translations. It uses “carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as other ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary.” The use of “ordainances” (lowercase) is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary term “Ordinances” (capitalized), but it is not a major issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent, with the only minor issue being the phrase “under other Ordinances” which is slightly redundant. It could be simplified to “under other Ordinances.”\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the exact terms from the dictionary. It should also avoid redundancy and maintain parallel structure. Based on the above review, the fifth and sixth translations are the strongest, with the fifth being slightly more concise and natural in phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred upon him under that Ordinance, as well as other Ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"licensing\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is acceptable, though \"recognition\" might be more precise in a regulatory context. The term \"deposittaking companies\" is misspelled as \"deposittaking\" (should be \"deposit-taking\").\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"authorisation matters\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is appropriate. However, \"vested in it\" is slightly more formal than necessary and could be simplified to \"conferred by\" or \"under.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"authorization\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is accurate. The phrase \"matters relating to the authorization\" is slightly wordy but still clear. The use of \"responsibilities\" alongside \"powers\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and uses \"recognition matters\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is appropriate. However, \"businesses\" is plural, while the original uses \"業務\" (singular), which may be better rendered as \"business\" to match the original's singular form.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"recognition matters\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is accurate. It is grammatically sound and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"licensing\" for \"認可事宜,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"recognition.\" The term \"deposittaking companies\" is again misspelled.\n**Reasoning for improvement**:\n- The term \"認可事宜\" should be translated as \"recognition matters\" to reflect the formal regulatory process of granting recognition.\n- \"deposittaking companies\" should be corrected to \"deposit-taking companies.\"\n- The phrase \"exercising its duties and powers\" is more natural than \"vested in it\" or \"conferred by.\"\n- The use of \"business\" (singular) is more consistent with the original text than \"businesses\" (plural).\n- \"Handling recognition matters\" is more precise than \"licensing\" or \"authorisation.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority, exercising its duties and powers conferred by the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking business and deposit-taking business. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling recognition matters relating to licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"resolution authority,\" \"banking sector entities,\" and \"systemic risk.\" This is a strong point, as adherence to the dictionary is crucial for consistency and legal accuracy.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are subtle differences in the choice of verbs and adjectives that affect the tone and precision of the translation. For instance, the phrase \"conduct orderly resolution\" (used in Translation 1 and 5) is slightly more formal and precise than \"orderly resolve\" (used in 2, 3, 4, and 6). Additionally, the use of \"no longer viable\" (Translation 3 and 5) is more idiomatic in English legal contexts than \"unsustainable\" or \"not operating sustainably,\" which are slightly more literal translations of the Chinese.\nThe phrase \"the collapse of which may constitute systemic risk\" (used in Translation 1 and 5) is slightly more precise than \"the failure of which may constitute systemic risk\" (used in 3 and 5) or \"the closure of which may constitute systemic risk\" (used in 6), as \"collapse\" more directly conveys the severity of the situation described in the original text.\nThe final phrase \"striving to protect public funds\" is used in all translations except Translation 1, which uses \"safeguard public funds.\" While both are correct, \"protect\" is slightly more common in legal English than \"safeguard\" in this context.\nConsidering these nuances, the best possible translation would retain the formal tone of the original text, use precise legal terminology, and ensure clarity and fluency in English. It should also reflect the intent of the original text accurately, particularly in describing the role of the Monetary Authority and the potential consequences of the collapse of banking sector entities.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance stipulates that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is granted a series of powers to conduct orderly resolutions of banking sector entities that are no longer viable (the collapse of which may constitute systemic risk), in order to maintain financial stability while striving to protect public funds.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by junior translators mostly capture the intended meaning. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and the use of appropriate terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the official names of the ordinances as specified in the dictionary: \"Securities and Futures Ordinance\" and \"Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance.\"\n- The term \"Monetary Authority\" is consistently used for \"金融管理專員,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The use of \"grant,\" \"confer upon,\" and \"empower\" are all valid verbs for \"賦予\" in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** uses \"bank securities,\" which is not a standard term and may confuse readers. The correct phrase should be \"banking and securities.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"businesses\" instead of \"business,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly uses \"banking securities\" without a conjunction, which is not standard English.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"and\" between \"banking\" and \"securities,\" which is correct, but \"operations\" is less precise than \"business\" in this legal context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The verb \"grant\" is more direct and commonly used in legal contexts than \"confer upon\" or \"empower.\"\n- \"Banking and securities\" is the standard phrasing and avoids ambiguity.\n- \"Mandatory provident fund\" is the more commonly used term in legal English, though \"Mandatory Provident Fund\" is also acceptable.\n- \"Business\" is more appropriate than \"operations\" in this context, as it refers to the general scope of activities.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Monetary Authority certain powers relating to banking and securities and mandatory provident fund business.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and structure that affect clarity and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"Insurance Authority,\" \"Insurance Ordinance,\" and \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- The core meaning of the sentence is preserved in all translations: the Insurance Authority has delegated inspection and investigation powers regarding banks' insurance-related business to the Monetary Authority.\n- The use of \"delegated\" or \"delegates\" is appropriate, though the tense varies slightly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"has delegated,\" which implies a completed action, but the original sentence does not specify whether the delegation is ongoing or completed.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"delegates\" without a time reference, which may be less precise than the original.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the bank's insurance-related business,\" which is slightly narrower than the original, which refers to \"banks’ insurance-related business\" in general.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"investigative and inquiry powers,\" which is slightly redundant and less precise than \"inspection and investigation powers.\"\n- **Translation 5** and **Translation 6** are very similar and both use \"relating to the insurance business of banks,\" which is slightly less precise than \"insurance-related business of banks.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"delegates\" without a tense marker to reflect the ongoing nature of the delegation.\n- Use \"insurance-related business of banks\" to match the original phrasing.\n- Use \"inspection and investigation powers\" to maintain clarity and precision.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Insurance Authority delegates to the Monetary Authority the powers of inspection and investigation regarding the insurance-related business of banks under the Insurance Ordinance.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency and precision. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"customer due diligence,\" and \"record-keeping requirements.\" However, there are differences in phrasing and structure that affect clarity and naturalness in English.\nTranslation 1 is clear and grammatically correct, using \"supervise banks in complying with the Ordinance's provisions regarding...\" which is natural and precise.\nTranslation 2 is also accurate, using \"supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\" The phrasing is slightly more concise and flows well.\nTranslation 3 and 4 are similar, with the only difference being \"supervise\" vs. \"empowers\" and the order of \"record-keeping requirements and customer due diligence.\" While both are correct, \"supervise\" is more aligned with the original Chinese term \"監管,\" which implies oversight rather than empowerment.\nTranslation 5 is nearly identical to Translation 1, with the only difference being the placement of \"customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements.\" This does not significantly affect the meaning.\nTranslation 6 uses \"monitor compliance with the Ordinance's provisions regarding...\" which is slightly more passive and less direct than \"supervise banks’ compliance with...\" The use of \"monitor\" may not fully capture the active regulatory role implied by \"監管.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best approach is to use a structure that clearly conveys the authority granted to the Monetary Authority, the subject (banks), and the specific obligations (customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements). The phrase \"supervise banks’ compliance with\" is more direct and natural in legal English than \"supervise banks in complying with.\"\nThe improved translation should also ensure that the terms are in the correct order and that the sentence flows smoothly in English while preserving the original meaning.\nThe best possible translation is:\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance authorizes the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe original text outlines the legal authority granted by the *Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance* to the *Monetary Authority*, specifying their role in assisting with the operation of the *Deposit Protection Scheme* and initiating *Compensation payments* from the *Deposit Protection Scheme Fund* to depositors of *licensed banks* that are *insolvent*.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains the legal tone. However, \"initiate compensation payments to depositors of insolvent licensed banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund\" could be slightly clearer in structure.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"unable to repay their debts\" is slightly less precise than \"insolvent\" and may not fully capture the legal nuance. Also, \"Compensation payments\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the first, but \"licensed banks that are unable to meet their obligations\" is slightly less direct than \"insolvent licensed banks.\" The capitalization of \"Compensation\" is also inconsistent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"insolvent licensed banks\" correctly and maintains the correct structure. However, it omits the phrase \"to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme\" and replaces it with \"provide assistance in the operation,\" which is slightly less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"insolvent licensed banks\" and \"from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund\" correctly. The only minor issue is the capitalization of \"Compensation.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses the correct terms and structure. The only minor issue is the capitalization of \"Compensation.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Maintain a formal and legal tone.\n- Ensure clarity and precision in legal terminology.\n- Use consistent capitalization for terms like \"Compensation payments.\"\nBased on the above, the best translation would combine the strengths of the first, fifth, and sixth translations, ensuring clarity, precision, and consistency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority the responsibility to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate compensation payments to depositors of insolvent licensed banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"licensing regime,\" \"clearing and settlement systems,\" \"electronic and physical 'facilities',\" and \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\" However, there are subtle variations in verb usage and prepositions that affect the tone and precision of the translations.\nThe first translation uses \"can specify and supervise,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"may designate and supervise,\" used in the second, third, fifth, and sixth translations. The second translation uses \"Ordinances\" instead of \"Ordinance\" in the second sentence, which is incorrect since the full title of the legislation is singular. The third translation is very close to the best version, using \"may designate and supervise\" and \"meet the criteria specified under the Ordinance.\" The fourth translation uses \"empowers\" and \"regulate the licensing regime,\" which is slightly less precise than \"authorizes the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime.\" The fifth and sixth translations are very similar, with the sixth using \"has the authority to designate\" and \"complying with the specified criteria under the Ordinance,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nThe best version would retain the formal tone of the original text, use \"may designate and supervise\" for consistency, and ensure that \"Ordinance\" is used correctly in both instances. It should also use \"complying with the criteria specified in the Ordinance\" for clarity and consistency.\nBased on this review, the improved translation would be:\nUnder the statutory regime of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Monetary Authority may designate and supervise certain important clearing and settlement systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. The Ordinance also authorizes the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for electronic and physical \"facilities\" used for storing monetary value and complying with the criteria specified in the Ordinance.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n\n- 建立了一套清晰的機構管治架構；\n- 維持高問責性及透明度，並與各持份者保持緊密聯繫；及\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準。\n\n金管局的管治架構涵蓋幾個主要部分，包括給予意見和指導的各法定諮詢委員會、問責性與透明度，以及內部監控與外部審計。\n\n# 金管局與特區政府\n\n金管局是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及管理層\n\n# 諮詢委員會\n\n諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》成立，就與財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權相關的事宜向其提供意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員各以本身的專業知識及經驗獲得委任，使外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下設有五個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定範疇的工作和給予意見，並透過諮詢委員會向財政政司長報告及提出建議。有關外匯基金諮詢委員會及其轄下五個專責委員會的詳情，請參閱第53至63頁。\n\n銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會就有關《銀行業條例》，特別是有關銀行、接受存款公司及有限制牌照銀行經營銀行業務或接受存款業務（視屬何情況而定）的事宜，向香港特別行政區行政長官提供意見。兩個委員會均由財政司司長擔任主席，成員包括金融管理專員及財政司司長根據行政長官的授權而委任的人士。有關銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會的詳情，請參閱第64至65頁。\n\n# 管理層\n\n總裁委員會由金管局總裁、副總裁及其他高層人員組成，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。總裁委員會定期開會，向總裁匯報金管局各部門主要工作的進度，並就與金管局運作有關的政策事項向總裁提供意見。有關總裁委員會成員名單，請參閱第66至67頁。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n# 與公眾溝通\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局亦盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項，尤其透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n此外，金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放六日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能一章（第185至191頁）。\n\n# 立法會\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年三次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。金管局總裁定期在財經事務委員會作出的簡報載於金管局網站。\n\n此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 資訊披露\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演講辭及簡報會資料文件。\n\n金管局不時檢討外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的披露是否足夠。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n# 內部監控與外部審計\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和匯報各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management

governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfillment of statutory mandates, and has therefore consistently strived to uphold a high standard of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to good Corporate Governance, the HKMA:\n\n- Established a clear governance structure;  \n- Maintained high accountability and transparency, and maintained close communication with all stakeholders; and  \n- Implemented robust controls to manage risks and ensure that the behavior of all employees at all levels and their day-to-day operations comply with specified standards.\n\nThe original text discusses the corporate governance framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), highlighting its key components. The junior translators have all correctly used the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"corporate governance framework,\" \"statutory Advisory Committees,\" \"internal controls and external audit,\" and \"transparency.\" However, there are minor differences in phrasing and fluency across the translations.\nThe first, second, third, sixth, and fifth translations are very similar, with slight variations in prepositions (e.g., \"encompasses,\" \"includes,\" \"covers\") and the order of phrases (e.g., \"advice and guidance\" vs. \"opinions and guidance\"). The fourth translation uses \"covers\" and \"which\" instead of \"that,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal.\nThe most notable difference is in the third and fifth translations, which use \"provide guidance and opinions\" and \"provide opinions and guidance,\" respectively. While both are acceptable, \"advice and guidance\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like corporate governance, making it more appropriate for this text.\nIn terms of fluency and natural English expression, the use of \"encompasses\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"includes\" or \"covers,\" which makes it a stronger choice for a document of this nature. Additionally, the structure \"including the statutory Advisory Committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audit\" is clear and well-balanced.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use \"encompasses,\" \"advice and guidance,\" and maintain the structure that clearly separates the components of the governance framework.\nThe HKMA’s corporate governance framework encompasses several key components, including the statutory Advisory Committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audit.\n\n# HKMA and the HKSAR Government\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"civil service,\" \"day-to-day operations,\" \"Chief Executive of the HKMA,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" and \"Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, formality, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the structure and meaning of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and accurate.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"terms of engagement\" or \"terms of appointment,\" which are less common than \"terms of employment\" in official contexts.\n- The phrase \"public officials\" is used in some translations, while others use \"public officers.\" Both are acceptable, but \"public officials\" is more commonly used in formal English.\n- The term \"the法定 powers\" in the sixth translation is a mix of English and Chinese, which is an error and should be corrected to \"statutory powers.\"\n- Some translations use \"the Government\" or \"the HKSAR Government\" as a parenthetical, which is acceptable but can be made more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"terms of employment\" consistently for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"public officials\" for consistency with official terminology.\n- Ensure that all terms are fully translated and no mixed-language phrases are present.\n- Maintain a consistent and formal tone throughout the translation.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the phrasing for maximum clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (the HKSAR Government), but it can employ staff under terms of employment different from those applicable to the civil service, in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officials. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the scope of statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in phrasing, terminology, and structure. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is well-structured and uses the correct terminology from the dictionary. It accurately conveys the responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority. However, it uses \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase \"currency stability\" or \"monetary stability.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is also accurate and uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"HK$7.80 per US dollar\" and maintains a clear structure. However, it uses \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase form.\n3. **Translation 3** is fluent and uses \"Currency Board system\" and \"monetary stability\" correctly. It uses \"7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar,\" which is slightly wordier than necessary but still correct. It also uses \"determination of relevant strategies,\" which is slightly less idiomatic than \"deciding on the relevant strategies.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is accurate and uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" and \"HK$7.80 to US$1.\" It is concise and well-structured. However, it uses \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase form.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses \"Currency Board system\" and \"currency stability\" correctly. It uses \"instruments\" instead of \"tools,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable. It also uses \"on its own\" to reflect the original text's \"自行負責,\" which is a good choice.\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses \"Currency Board system\" and \"monetary stability\" correctly. It uses \"on its own\" to reflect the original text's \"自行負責,\" which is a good choice. However, it uses \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase form.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Consistency in terminology is crucial. The dictionary provides both \"monetary stability\" and \"currency stability,\" but \"monetary stability\" is more commonly used in formal economic contexts.\n- \"Currency Board system\" is more specific and preferred over \"Currency Board arrangements\" in this context.\n- \"HK$7.80 to 1 US dollar\" is more concise and commonly used than \"7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar.\"\n- \"Deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and operational means\" is more idiomatic than \"determination of relevant strategies\" or \"determining the relevant strategies.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and the structure of the monetary system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority, it was stated that the Currency Board system should be used to maintain monetary stability, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and operational means, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" \"financial system,\" and \"Monetary Authority.\" The core meaning of the original text is preserved in all versions.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Correct use of the required dictionary terms.\n- Accurate rendering of the main idea: the Financial Secretary's responsibility for maintaining the financial system and the Monetary Authority's role in implementing policies.\n- Generally fluent and natural English.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"implementing policies\" twice (e.g., in Translation 1 and 5), which may be redundant.\n- The phrase \"preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center\" is repeated in several translations, though it is not incorrect.\n- The use of \"financial centre\" versus \"financial center\" is a minor stylistic choice, but \"center\" is more commonly used in American English, while \"centre\" is British English. The original uses \"中心\" (center), so either is acceptable, but consistency is key.\n- Some translations use \"duties\" while others use \"responsibilities\" for \"職責.\" Both are correct, but \"responsibilities\" may be slightly more formal and appropriate in this context.\nImprovements could include:\n- Ensuring consistency in the use of \"center\" or \"centre.\"\n- Avoiding redundancy by varying the phrasing of \"implementing these policies.\"\n- Using \"responsibilities\" instead of \"duties\" for \"職責\" to maintain a more formal tone.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, avoid redundancy, and use consistent and formal language.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system, as well as preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the responsibilities of the Monetary Authority include:\n\n- Promote the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;  \n- Handle matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;  \n- Promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of clearing and settlement systems, and where appropriate, be responsible for operating such systems; and  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implement appropriate market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe original text outlines the authority structure regarding the Exchange Fund, specifying that the Financial Secretary holds control and that the Monetary Authority is responsible for its management and investment under delegated powers. All six translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" and \"Financial Secretary.\" This is a strength across all versions.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are largely correct, though there are subtle differences in phrasing and word choice that affect clarity and naturalness. For instance, \"must be accountable to\" and \"shall be responsible to\" are both grammatically correct, but \"shall\" is more formal and often used in legal or official contexts, which aligns well with the tone of the original text. \"Based on the powers delegated by\" and \"in accordance with the powers delegated by\" are both accurate, but \"in accordance with\" is slightly more formal and precise in legal writing.\nThe use of \"deployment\" in the fourth translation is slightly less common than \"management\" or \"use\" in the context of fund operations, which may make it less natural. Similarly, \"conferred by\" in the fifth translation is a valid synonym for \"delegated by,\" but \"delegated\" is more commonly used in this context.\nThe best translations are those that maintain a formal tone, use precise legal terminology, and ensure clarity. The fourth and sixth translations are particularly strong in this regard, with the fourth using \"deployment\" and the sixth using \"according to.\" However, \"management and investment\" is more direct and commonly used in financial contexts than \"deployment and investment management.\"\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would retain the formal tone, use \"shall be responsible to\" for clarity and formality, and use \"in accordance with the powers delegated by\" for precision. It would also use \"management and investment\" to align with standard financial terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority shall be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Management\n\n# Advisory Committees\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。**\nThe dictionary specifies that **諮詢委員會** must be translated as **Advisory Committees** and **金管局** as **HKMA**.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1 & 2** are identical:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide advice and guidance on the HKMA's main areas of work.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms, clear and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase *\"on the HKMA's main areas of work\"* is slightly awkward. It could be more natural to say *\"on the HKMA’s key areas of work\"* or *\"regarding the HKMA’s main areas of work.\"*\n2. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide advice and guidance to the HKMA on its key areas of work.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"key\" instead of \"main,\" which is more common in formal contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The preposition \"to\" changes the meaning slightly. The original sentence implies that the Advisory Committees are giving advice *on* the HKMA’s work, not *to* the HKMA. This could be misinterpreted as the HKMA receiving advice, rather than the Advisory Committees providing it on the HKMA’s work.\n3. **Translation 4 & 6**:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide opinions and guidance on the main areas of work of the HKMA.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"opinions\" instead of \"advice,\" which is closer to the original Chinese term **給予意見**.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Main areas of work of the HKMA\" is slightly wordy and less natural than \"HKMA’s main areas of work.\"\n4. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide opinions and guidance on the HKMA’s key areas of work.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"key\" and \"opinions,\" which are both more natural and precise in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None significant. This is a strong candidate.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The original sentence uses **給予意見和指導**, which is best translated as **provide opinions and guidance**.\n- The phrase **主要工作範疇** is best rendered as **main areas of work** or **key areas of work**. \"Key\" is more commonly used in formal English contexts.\n- The structure **就...給予意見和指導** implies that the Advisory Committees are providing input *on* the HKMA’s work, not *to* the HKMA. Therefore, the preposition **on** is more accurate than **to**.\n### Improved Translation:\nAdvisory Committees provide opinions and guidance on the HKMA’s key areas of work.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC),\" \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"Sub-Committees.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- Most translations use appropriate formal language suitable for official documentation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"Advisory Committees\" or \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" multiple times, which can reduce readability.\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Some translations use vague or imprecise phrasing, such as \"in their personal capacity\" or \"in their own right,\" which may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"以個人身分.\"\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** A few translations sound overly literal or awkward, such as \"Members are appointed based on their own professional knowledge and experience, which benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee greatly.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations inconsistently use \"EFAC\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which could confuse readers.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"EFAC\" consistently where appropriate to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure clarity in phrases like \"in their personal capacity\" by using more natural phrasing such as \"in their personal capacity.\"\n- Improve sentence flow by avoiding repetition and ensuring that the structure is natural in English.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified and that the translation reflects the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to provide advice to the Financial Secretary on matters relating to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio Chairman of EFAC, while other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their personal capacity, under the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. Members are appointed based on their individual expertise and experience, thereby greatly benefiting EFAC. EFAC has five Sub-Committees under its jurisdiction, responsible for monitoring the work of the HKMA in specific areas and providing advice, and for reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through EFAC. For details regarding EFAC and its five Sub-Committees, please refer to pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"BAC,\" \"DTCAC,\" \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,\" \"restricted licence banks,\" and \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- Most translations maintain the structure and intent of the original text, particularly in explaining the roles of the committees and their relationship with the Chief Executive and the Financial Secretary.\n- The use of \"as applicable\" or \"as the case may be\" effectively conveys the conditional nature of the businesses involved.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"business of banking and deposit-taking business carried on by...\" which is slightly awkward and repetitive.\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 4** are very similar and use \"conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business by...\" which is more natural but slightly less precise than \"carrying on banking business or deposit-taking business.\"\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly states that the Financial Secretary is appointed by the Chief Executive, which is not accurate; the Financial Secretary is a government official, not an appointee.\n- **Translation 5** and **Translation 6** are more concise and grammatically sound, but **Translation 6** uses \"have the Financial Secretary as chairman\" which is less formal than \"chaired by the Financial Secretary.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the most natural phrasing while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.\n- The phrase \"carrying on banking business or deposit-taking business (as the case may be)\" is more precise and idiomatic than \"conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business.\"\n- The phrase \"chaired by the Financial Secretary\" is more standard and formal than \"have the Financial Secretary as chairman.\"\n- The phrase \"appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive\" is more precise than \"appointed by the Chief Executive in accordance with his delegated authority.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Banking Advisory Committee (BAC) and the Deposittaking Companies Advisory Committee (DTCAC) provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR on matters relating to the Banking Ordinance, particularly concerning banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted licence banks carrying on banking business or deposit-taking business (as the case may be). Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, with members including the Monetary Authority and persons appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive. Details regarding the Banking Advisory Committee and the Deposittaking Companies Advisory Committee can be found on pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management Team\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in style, terminology consistency, and fluency that can be refined for a more polished and professional result.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" for \"金管局總裁\" and \"CEC\" or \"Chief Executive’s Committee\" for \"總裁委員會.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"CEC\" as an abbreviation is consistent in most translations, though some use the full form \"Chief Executive’s Committee\" for clarity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Deputy Chief Executives\" (plural) while others use \"Deputy Chief Executive\" (singular). The original text uses \"副總裁\" (singular), so \"Deputy Chief Executive\" is more accurate.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more verbose than necessary, such as \"the progress of major work carried out by the various departments of the HKMA\" (Translation 4), which can be simplified to \"the progress of major work in the HKMA’s various departments.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"Chief Executive\" unnecessarily, such as \"the Chief Executive of the HKMA serving as chairman\" (Translation 4), which can be streamlined to \"serving as chairman.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"Chairman\" (Translation 4 and 6) is slightly more formal and traditional, while \"Chair\" or \"Chairperson\" might be more commonly used in modern corporate contexts. However, \"Chairman\" is acceptable in formal institutional settings.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistency in the use of \"Deputy Chief Executive\" (singular) as per the original.\n- Use \"CEC\" consistently where appropriate, and use the full form \"Chief Executive’s Committee\" only when necessary for clarity.\n- Simplify sentence structures to enhance fluency and readability.\n- Ensure that titles and roles are used consistently and appropriately for the context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Chief Executive’s Committee is composed of the Chief Executive of the HKMA, the Deputy Chief Executive, and other senior personnel, with the Chief Executive of the HKMA serving as chairman. The CEC meets regularly to report to the Chief Executive on the progress of major work in the HKMA’s various departments and to provide advice on policy matters related to the HKMA’s operations. For the list of CEC members, please refer to pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese sentence, which is that the HKMA maintains a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in implementing government policy targets, while also ensuring accountability and transparency. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"day-to-day operations,\" \"policy targets,\" and \"transparency.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"autonomy,\" \"accountability,\" and \"transparency\" is consistent with the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"methods used to implement government policy targets,\" which is slightly wordy and less direct than alternatives.\n- The second translation uses \"the methods employed to implement the policy targets,\" which is slightly awkward due to the placement of \"the\" before \"policy targets.\"\n- The third translation uses \"the implementation of policy targets,\" which is more concise but slightly less precise than \"methods used to implement policy targets.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"methods for day-to-day operations and implementation of government policy targets,\" which is more concise but slightly less explicit about the \"methods\" used in implementation.\n- The fifth translation uses \"the methods it adopts to implement policy targets,\" which is natural but slightly more verbose.\n- The sixth translation uses \"the methods used to implement government policy targets,\" which is clear and concise, but the phrase \"supported by a strong sense of accountability and transparency\" is slightly less direct than \"while also ensuring high accountability and transparency.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- The phrase \"methods used to implement government policy targets\" is the most direct and natural in English.\n- The phrase \"while also ensuring high accountability and transparency\" is more active and precise than \"supported by\" or \"incorporating.\"\n- The use of \"consistently maintained\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for an official context than \"has always maintained.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods used to implement government policy targets, while also ensuring high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Legislative Council,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"transparency,\" and \"Financial Secretary.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and accurate conveyance of the original meaning.\n- Generally fluent and grammatically correct English.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"promoting public understanding\" while others use \"promoting public awareness.\" \"Understanding\" is more precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"maintaining extensive engagement with society\" is more natural than \"maintaining extensive contact with society.\"\n- \"Striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness\" is slightly more natural than \"striving to enhance transparency and maintain an open approach.\"\n- \"Matters of public concern\" is more natural than \"issues of public concern\" or \"issues of concern to the public.\"\n- \"The objectives of this policy are as follows\" is slightly more formal than \"This policy has two main objectives,\" which is more concise and natural in this context.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing and precise vocabulary from the various versions, ensuring clarity, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also understands that it bears broader responsibilities, promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring matters of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA remains committed to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:\n\n- The translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are variations in fluency, structure, and word choice that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n  - The phrase \"responds appropriately to public opinion\" is consistently used, which is a natural and accurate rendering of \"對公眾意見作出適當回應.\"\n  - The use of \"societal trends\" or \"pulse of society\" effectively captures the meaning of \"社會脈搏.\"\n  - Most translations maintain the parallel structure of the original Chinese, which is important for readability and formality.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Some translations are overly wordy or awkward in structure. For example, \"To the extent permissible under statutory restrictions regarding the disclosure of market sensitivity, trade secrets, and confidential information\" is unnecessarily long and could be more concise.\n  - The phrase \"keeps its finger on the pulse of society\" is idiomatic and natural, but not all translations use this expression, which may affect consistency.\n  - Some translations use \"financial industry\" instead of \"financial sector,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in formal contexts.\n  - The placement of \"taking into account\" or \"while taking into account\" varies, and some translations place it at the beginning, which may disrupt the flow.\n- **Improvements**:\n  - A more balanced and concise structure would enhance readability.\n  - Using \"financial sector\" consistently would align with the formal tone of the original text.\n  - Ensuring that the phrase \"keeps its finger on the pulse of society\" is used consistently or replaced with a more formal equivalent if needed.\n  - Maintaining parallel structure between the two clauses would improve the overall coherence of the translation.\n- Based on these observations, the best possible translation would be one that is concise, fluent, and maintains the formal tone of the original, while accurately reflecting the meaning and intent of the Chinese text.\n- The final translation should use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局,\" maintain parallel structure, and use natural, idiomatic expressions where appropriate.\n---\nTo the extent possible, ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed of the HKMA’s work, taking into account statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and confidential information; and ensure that the HKMA keeps its finger on the pulse of society and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\n# Public Communication\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple heading: **# 與公眾溝通**, which translates to \"Communicating with the Public\" or similar variations. The junior translators have provided several versions, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in style and formality that can affect the overall tone and appropriateness of the translation.\n1. **\"Communicating with the Public\"** – This is a natural and commonly used phrase in English, especially in formal or professional contexts. It is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning clearly.\n2. **\"# Communicating with the Public\"** – This version includes the hashtag symbol, which is consistent with the original text. However, in English, the use of a hashtag in a heading is more common in digital or social media contexts. If this is intended for a formal document or report, the hashtag may be unnecessary.\n3. **\"Communicate with the public.\"** – This is a grammatically correct sentence, but the use of the period at the end makes it appear more like a statement than a heading. Headings in English are typically not followed by a period unless they are part of a larger structure.\n4. **\"# Communication with the Public\"** – This version is similar to the second one, but uses the noun form \"Communication\" instead of the gerund \"Communicating.\" While both are acceptable, \"Communicating with the Public\" is more commonly used as a heading.\n5. **\"Communicating with the public.\"** – This is similar to the third translation but uses the lowercase \"public\" and ends with a period. Again, this may not be ideal for a heading.\n6. **\"# Public Communication\"** – This is a concise and direct translation, but it may be less clear than \"Communicating with the Public\" in terms of conveying the active process of communication.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should be concise, clear, and appropriate for the context in which it will be used. Since the original text includes a hashtag, it is likely intended for a digital or social media context. However, if it is for a formal document, the hashtag may be omitted. Among the options, **\"Communicating with the Public\"** is the most natural and widely used phrase in English for this context. It is grammatically correct, clear, and maintains the intended meaning without unnecessary punctuation or stylistic choices that may not align with the intended use.\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)'s mission and objectives. The junior translators have generally produced accurate and fluent translations, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect the tone and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"official reserves,\" \"Banking Stability,\" and \"financial infrastructure.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"thereby\" effectively links the actions of the HKMA to the outcomes, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Banking Stability\" with a capital \"B,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry and may be perceived as a proper noun, which it is not.\n- The phrase \"sound and diversified\" is used in some translations, while others use \"robust and diversified.\" Both are acceptable, but \"sound\" may be slightly less common in this context.\n- The phrase \"promoting economic development\" is used in some translations, while others use \"promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\" The latter is more precise and aligns better with the original text, which emphasizes Hong Kong specifically.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- To maintain consistency, \"Banking Stability\" should be in lowercase unless it is a proper noun, which it is not in this context.\n- \"Robust and diversified\" is a more natural and commonly used phrase in financial contexts than \"sound and diversified.\"\n- Including \"Hong Kong's\" before \"economic development\" adds specificity and aligns with the original text's emphasis on Hong Kong.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, vocabulary choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. The use of \"enhance public communication\" is slightly less natural than \"communicate more effectively,\" but the overall structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"carrying out its responsibility\" and \"strives to address issues of significant public concern,\" which are natural and precise. The only minor issue is the use of \"related to HKMA policies\" instead of \"regarding HKMA policies.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"fall within its purview\" is slightly more formal than \"fall within its responsibilities,\" but it is still appropriate. The sentence structure is clear and professional.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is slightly less fluent due to the phrase \"as needed\" at the end, which is not present in the original text. The use of \"inaccurate information\" is slightly less precise than \"misinformation\" or \"false information.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"makes every effort to address issues of public concern\" and \"through traditional and social media,\" which are natural and accurate. The only minor issue is the use of \"contacts\" (plural) instead of \"contact\" (singular), though both are grammatically correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very strong and closely mirrors the best possible translation. It uses \"fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and operations\" and \"promptly clarifying false information and rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"its responsibilities\" instead of \"its purview\" or \"its scope of responsibilities,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best possible translation should be fluent, natural, and precise. It should use the most appropriate vocabulary and maintain the formal tone of the original text. The phrase \"fall within its responsibilities\" is slightly less precise than \"fall within its purview\" or \"scope of responsibilities.\" Additionally, \"misinformation\" is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"false information.\" The use of \"both traditional and social media\" is more precise than \"traditional and social media\" without \"both.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the second, third, and sixth junior translators, ensuring clarity, fluency, and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the HKMA must gain the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and operations to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive contact with the mass media and utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital era. The HKMA also makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its purview, particularly by promptly clarifying misinformation and rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA office has an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. Details regarding the HKMA's communication and liaison work with the public can be found in the \"Corporate Functions\" chapter (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and accurate, but uses \"briefing\" consistently, which is slightly repetitive. It also uses \"various operations and policies,\" which is slightly less natural than \"various work and policies.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, but uses \"providing briefings\" instead of \"briefing,\" which is more natural in this context. It also uses \"work and policies,\" which is more natural than \"operations and policies.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"answering related inquiries\" instead of \"answer relevant inquiries,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. It also uses \"made by\" instead of \"given by,\" which is a minor stylistic choice.\n4. **Translation 4** is the most concise and uses \"vital\" instead of \"very important,\" which is a stronger and more natural choice. It also uses \"updating the committee on the HKMA's operations and policies,\" which is more dynamic than \"briefing on.\"\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"pledged\" instead of \"committed,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still accurate. It also uses \"posted on the HKMA website\" instead of \"published on the HKMA's website,\" which is slightly less formal.\n6. **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 5, but uses \"crucial\" instead of \"very important\" and \"delivered by\" instead of \"given by.\" It is also more concise and natural in phrasing.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- Use \"vital\" instead of \"very important\" for stronger emphasis.\n- Use \"providing briefings\" instead of \"briefing\" for natural phrasing.\n- Use \"work and policies\" instead of \"operations and policies\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Use \"updating the committee on the HKMA's operations and policies\" for a more dynamic and precise description of the briefings.\n- Use \"published on the HKMA's website\" for consistency and formality.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and natural phrasing from the junior translations, while ensuring accuracy and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is vital for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has committed to providing three briefings annually to the Panel on Financial Affairs, updating the committee on the HKMA's operations and policies and answering related inquiries. The regular briefings presented to the Panel on Financial Affairs are published on the HKMA's website.\n\nIn addition, HKMA representatives occasionally attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Affairs Committee and Sub-committee to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information Disclosure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"transparency,\" and \"regulatory resources.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- The use of terms like \"bilingual website,\" \"publications,\" \"press releases,\" and \"presentation materials\" is appropriate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"international best practices\" while others use \"highest international standards.\" While both are acceptable, \"highest international standards\" is more aligned with the original Chinese phrasing and is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"published by the HKMA\" or \"issued by the HKMA,\" which can be simplified.\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"a large amount of publications\" or \"a wealth of publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials published by the HKMA,\" which can be more naturally expressed.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"journals\" while others use \"periodicals\" or \"publications.\" While all are acceptable, \"publications\" is more general and appropriate for the context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"highest international standards\" to align with the original Chinese phrasing and maintain formality.\n- Use \"publications\" as the general term for the various materials listed, avoiding redundancy.\n- Use \"features dedicated sections\" to maintain consistency and clarity.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and natural, avoiding unnecessary repetition.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency, publishing various Chinese and English journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a large collection of HKMA-published materials, including publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"EFAC,\" \"CBC,\" \"IMF,\" and \"Special Data Dissemination Standard.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"supervisory policies and guidelines\" and \"Currency Board system\" is accurate and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Precision:** Some translations use \"has participated\" or \"has contained,\" which may imply ongoing actions that are not explicitly stated in the original. The original uses \"開始參與\" (began participating) and \"載有\" (has featured\/carried), which are better rendered with past tense or present perfect depending on context.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** The phrase \"the HKMA website has featured\" or \"has contained\" is slightly less natural than \"has carried\" or \"has posted.\" Additionally, \"banking sector\" is slightly broader than \"banking industry,\" which may be more precise.\n- **Redundancy and Clarity:** Some translations repeat \"The HKMA\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"periodically\" instead of \"regularly\" for a more formal tone, as the original uses \"不時\" (occasionally\/periodically).\n- Use \"began participating\" to match the original's \"開始參與.\"\n- Use \"has carried\" or \"has posted\" for \"載有\" to reflect the ongoing presence of content on the website.\n- Use \"banking industry\" for consistency with the original's \"銀行業.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, with no substitutions or omissions.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA periodically reviews whether the disclosure of Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts is sufficient. The HKMA began participating in the IMF's Central Bank \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" program in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has carried supervisory policies and guidelines for the banking industry.\n\n# Internal Controls and External Audit\nThe original text is a heading, \"# 內部監控與外部審計,\" which translates directly to \"Internal Controls and External Audit\" according to the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used the dictionary term, which is a strength. However, there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Internal Controls and External Audit\" with proper capitalization, which is appropriate for a heading. The third and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original text. While this may be stylistically consistent with the original, it is not standard in English headings unless the \"#\" is used for a specific purpose, such as indicating a section or anchor point in a document.\nThe best translation would maintain the exact term from the dictionary while using proper English capitalization for a heading. Including the \"#\" symbol is optional and depends on the context in which the heading is used. If it is part of a document structure that uses numbered sections or anchors, it may be appropriate to retain it. Otherwise, it is more natural to omit it for a standard heading.\nTherefore, the most appropriate translation is \"Internal Controls and External Audit\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and widely accepted format for a heading in English.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"risk management,\" \"Internal and external audit functions,\" \"independent assessment,\" \"control mechanisms,\" and \"checks and balances.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"robust and effective,\" \"prudent,\" and \"appropriate checks and balances\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Employee integrity\" vs. \"employee conduct\":** While both are acceptable, \"employee conduct\" is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts and better reflects the intended meaning of \"員工操守.\"\n- **\"Ensure\" vs. \"ensure adherence to\":** The phrase \"ensure adherence to high standards\" is more precise and formal, but it adds unnecessary complexity. A simpler \"ensure high standards\" is more direct and natural in English.\n- **\"Sufficient and effective\" vs. \"adequate and effective\":** \"Sufficient\" is more commonly used in regulatory and institutional contexts than \"adequate,\" making it a better fit for the original text.\n- **\"Provide independent assessment\" vs. \"provide an independent assessment\":** The inclusion of the article \"an\" is more natural in English and improves fluency.\n- **\"Monitoring mechanisms\" vs. \"control mechanisms\":** The original text uses \"監控機制,\" which is best translated as \"control mechanisms,\" not \"monitoring mechanisms.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"employee conduct\" instead of \"employee integrity\" for consistency with formal regulatory language.\n- Use \"ensure high standards\" instead of \"ensure adherence to high standards\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"sufficient and effective\" instead of \"adequate and effective\" for consistency with the original tone.\n- Include the article \"an\" in \"provide an independent assessment\" for grammatical correctness and fluency.\n- Maintain \"control mechanisms\" as the correct translation of \"監控機制.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate these refinements to ensure clarity, fluency, and consistency with the original text and regulatory language.\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective control mechanisms to ensure high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. The internal and external audit functions provide an independent assessment of whether the control mechanisms are sufficient and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"行為守則\" as \"Code of Conduct,\" \"指定標準\" as \"specified standards,\" and \"道德與法律責任\" as \"ethical and legal responsibilities.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with the main clause and the dependent clause properly ordered.\n- The use of \"ensuring that\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations use phrases like \"all levels of employees\" or \"all levels of staff,\" which are slightly redundant. \"All employees\" or \"all staff\" is sufficient and more concise.\n- **Variation in prepositions and phrasing:** The use of \"complies with,\" \"meets,\" and \"adheres to\" are all correct, but \"meets\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like this.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"behavior\" while others use \"conduct\" or \"behavior.\" While all are acceptable, \"conduct\" is more aligned with the term \"行為\" in the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"conduct\" instead of \"behavior\" to align more closely with the original term \"行為.\"\n- Use \"all employees\" or \"all staff\" instead of \"all levels of employees\" or \"all levels of staff\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Use \"meets\" as the verb to describe compliance with standards, as it is more natural in this context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees’ ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees meets the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for identifying and assessing risks in their operational processes, and establishing appropriate control measures to ensure the HKMA’s day-to-day operations are sound and stable.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"first line of defence,\" \"risk management,\" \"operational processes,\" \"control measures,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"day-to-day operations.\" \nThe first, second, third, fourth, and sixth translations are very similar, with slight variations in verbs such as \"implementing,\" \"developing,\" or \"establishing\" for \"制定\" (to formulate), and in adjectives such as \"smoothly,\" \"stable,\" \"secure,\" or \"sound and stable\" for \"穩妥\" (secure\/stable). The fifth translation is the most comprehensive, using \"sound and stable\" to capture the full nuance of \"穩妥,\" which implies both reliability and stability.\nThe best translation would combine the strengths of these versions, using \"establishing\" for \"制定\" (to formulate), and \"sound and stable\" for \"穩妥\" to fully capture the intended meaning. The structure of the sentence should be clear and professional, as befits a document related to risk management and regulatory operations. The final translation above reflects this synthesis.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related control measures and mitigating strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the role of the Internal Audit Division of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). It outlines the division's responsibility to independently evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of governance procedures, risk management, and control processes across different departments and to provide improvement recommendations.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"risk management and control processes\" from the dictionary. However, \"conducts an independent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"independent assessment\" and \"risk management and control processes\" correctly. The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and uses the correct terms. However, the placement of \"whether\" introduces a slight deviation from the original structure, which may affect clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses the correct terms and is fluent. The use of \"to determine whether\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct terms. It is concise and natural, with a clear structure.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses the correct terms. It is slightly more formal due to the use of \"various departments\" and \"to propose improvement recommendations,\" but it is still fluent and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should use the correct dictionary terms and avoid unnecessary complexity. The structure should clearly convey that the Internal Audit Division independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of governance procedures, risk management, and control processes across different departments and provides improvement recommendations.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA conducts independent assessments of the governance procedures, risk management and control processes of different departments to determine whether they are sufficient and effective, and provides improvement recommendations.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge any fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA Annual Report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖

通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖

股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖

經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖

盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11

rebound in exports of goods amid improved external demand and the recovery of the global tech cycle. The labour market remained resilient, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures further eased. The local stock market showed a significant rebound, while the property market remained largely weak due to subdued market sentiment amid a sustained high-interest environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, Mainland’s proactive economic stimulus measures, combined with comprehensive support for local businesses, should help reinforce business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international exchanges and deepen regional ties.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economy Activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy experienced moderate growth in 2024. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, following a 3.2% increase in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Externally, exports of goods rebounded to positive growth, driven by improved external demand and the recovery of the global tech cycle, becoming a major driver of overall economic growth. Exports of services also increased further, supported by the continued recovery of inbound tourism and a significant rise in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, the significant increase in imports of services, driven by sustained growth in outbound tourism, offset the positive effects of service exports on overall economic growth. Locally, private consumption expenditure softened due to changes in residents' consumption patterns. In contrast, increased property transactions and improved business sentiment, amid gradually easing monetary conditions, led to a slight rise in overall investment expenditure.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Gross Domestic Product  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Growth of Real Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: Detailed quarterly changes in seasonally adjusted gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nDespite the gradual rise in newly signed residential rentals, local cost pressures remained largely under control. Combined with the gradual easing of external price pressures, local inflation remained moderate in 2024 (Figure 2). For the full year of 2024, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"labour market,\" \"unemployment rate,\" \"total employment,\" \"labour force,\" \"labour demand and supply,\" \"nominal wages,\" \"labour earnings,\" \"manpower shortage,\" \"talent attraction schemes,\" \"Policy Address,\" and \"local population.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that affect fluency and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and accurate.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n- The use of terms like \"inject new momentum\" or \"inject new impetus\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"fluctuating\" to describe the unemployment rate, which may imply variability, whereas the original suggests a stable, low range. \"Hovering\" or \"remaining low\" are more precise.\n- The phrase \"inject new momentum\" is repeated in several translations, though \"inject new impetus\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in policy contexts.\n- Some translations use \"since the first quarter\" while others use \"starting from the first quarter\" — both are acceptable, but \"since\" may be more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"to alleviate manpower shortage problems\" is slightly wordy; \"to alleviate manpower shortages\" is more concise and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"hovering\" or \"remaining low\" to more accurately reflect the stability of the unemployment rate.\n- Use \"inject new impetus\" for a more formal and natural tone.\n- Use \"since the first quarter\" for smoother flow.\n- Simplify \"manpower shortage problems\" to \"manpower shortages.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe labour market performed steadily in 2024, with the unemployment rate hovering between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Figure 3). Since the first quarter, total employment (Figure 3) has gradually increased, and the labour force has also expanded, reflecting a broadly stable balance between labour demand and supply. At the same time, with continued economic growth, both nominal wages and labour earnings recorded steady increases. Furthermore, the government announced in the 2024 Policy Address that it would further optimise Hong Kong’s talent attraction schemes to alleviate manpower shortages in various industries and inject new impetus into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nFigure 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, containing two key elements: a title (\"圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\") and a source citation (\"資料來源：政府統計處\"). The dictionary provides exact translations for the terms \"消費物價通脹\" and \"政府統計處,\" which must be used as specified.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" and \"Census and Statistics Department.\"  \n   - \"Data source\" is slightly less formal than \"Source,\" but still acceptable.  \n   - Punctuation is inconsistent (no colon after \"Figure 2\").\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Consumer Price Inflation\" without the term \"Basic,\" which may misrepresent the original meaning.  \n   - \"Data Source\" is correctly capitalized.  \n   - Formatting is clean and professional.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Basic consumer price inflation\" with lowercase \"basic,\" which is less formal and less consistent with title case.  \n   - \"Source\" is correctly used.  \n   - Punctuation is minimal but acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" and \"Source.\"  \n   - Formatting is clean and consistent with standard academic or report-style formatting.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Incorrectly uses \"Core\" instead of \"Basic,\" which may not be an exact synonym in this context.  \n   - \"Data Source\" is correctly used.  \n   - The term \"Core\" may imply a different statistical measure than \"Basic,\" so this is a potential misinterpretation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Incorrectly uses \"Core\" instead of \"Basic.\"  \n   - \"Source\" is used without a colon, which is less standard in formal citations.  \n   - Formatting is compact but lacks clarity.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact term \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" as specified in the dictionary, and \"Source: Census and Statistics Department\" for clarity and consistency with formal citation styles. The fourth junior translator's version is the closest to this standard, with only minor punctuation adjustments needed to ensure full compliance with formal formatting. The term \"Basic\" is crucial here, as it may refer to a specific type of inflation measure, and substituting it with \"Core\" could lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, the improved translation should retain \"Basic\" and use \"Source:\" with a colon for clarity.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nThe junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms provided. All translations correctly use \"Census and Statistics Department\" for \"政府統計處\" and either \"Labour Market Conditions\" or \"Labour Market Situation\" for \"勞工市場狀況.\" The primary difference lies in the choice between \"Conditions\" and \"Situation\" to translate \"狀況.\"\n\"Conditions\" is more commonly used in formal or statistical contexts to describe the state or circumstances of a market, making it a more natural fit for a report or data-driven text. \"Situation\" is also acceptable but slightly more general and less precise in this context. Additionally, the sixth translation uses \"Data Source\" instead of \"Source,\" which is slightly more verbose and less standard in such captions.\nThe best translation should use \"Labour Market Conditions\" for clarity and precision, and \"Source\" as the standard term for citing the origin of the data. The structure should be concise and consistent with standard academic or statistical reporting formats.\n\n# Equity Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"local stock market,\" \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"interest rate cuts,\" \"economic stimulus measures,\" \"US Federal Reserve (Fed),\" \"US presidential election,\" and \"monetary easing.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and clarity that can be refined for maximum fluency and precision.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required dictionary terms.\n- Clear and logical structure that mirrors the original Chinese text.\n- Proper use of financial terminology and context.\n- Consistent use of \"Hang Seng Index\" and \"local stock market\" as specified.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"marked shift\" or \"significant shift\" instead of \"significant turnaround,\" which is slightly less idiomatic in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"leading to a slight correction\" is used in several translations, which is acceptable, but \"slight pullback\" or \"slight retreat\" may be more natural in financial writing.\n- The phrase \"ending a four-year consecutive decline\" is used in some translations, but \"ending a four-year declining trend\" or \"ending four consecutive years of decline\" is more concise and natural.\n- Some translations use \"notably\" or \"notedly\" to describe the improvement in market sentiment, which is acceptable but can be replaced with \"significantly\" for consistency.\n- The phrase \"triggered market concerns regarding\" is slightly wordy; \"triggered market concerns about\" is more concise.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining the phrasing for greater fluency and naturalness in financial English.\n---\nThe local stock market significantly turned around in 2024, following a sharp rebound since mid-September. Specifically, with interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the introduction of proactive economic stimulus measures in mainland China, market sentiment improved significantly, driving the Hang Seng Index to a year-high of 23,100 points on October 7 (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November triggered concerns about the global economic outlook and the pace of monetary easing by the Fed, leading to a slight pullback in the local stock market. Nonetheless, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points by year-end, representing a substantial 17.7% increase compared to the end of 2023, ending four consecutive years of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"housing transactions market\" is an awkward phrasing; \"residential property market\" is more natural. Also, \"supported by policy measures eased\" is slightly awkward; \"relaxation of policy measures\" is better.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"housing transactions\" correctly and maintains a natural flow. However, \"housing transactions market\" is again an awkward phrasing, and \"remain relatively tight\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"remained tight.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"residential property market\" correctly and includes \"relevant policy measures\" which is a good choice. However, \"spending patterns\" is slightly less precise than \"consumption patterns.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is one of the strongest translations. It uses \"residential property market\" correctly, and the phrasing is natural and fluent. The use of \"grappled with challenges stemming from shifts in consumer behavior\" is particularly well-crafted.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"residential housing transactions\" which is slightly more specific than necessary, but still correct. The phrase \"leading to a slight improvement in housing affordability\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"residential property market\" correctly and includes \"sustained high mortgage rates\" which is a good variation. However, \"vacancy rates for office segments\" is slightly awkward; \"vacancy rates in the office segment\" is better.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best version should maintain the natural flow of the original text, use the dictionary terms accurately, and avoid awkward phrasing. It should also use idiomatic expressions and maintain a consistent tone. Based on the above review, the fourth and fifth translations are the strongest, with the fourth being slightly more fluent and idiomatic.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe residential property market remained largely weak in the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. Supported by the relaxation of relevant policy measures in late February and mid-October, as well as the support from the interest rate cut cycle that began in September, annual housing transactions surged by 23.5% from the historical low of 43,002 in 2023 to 53,099 in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage rates and accumulated inventory in the primary market continued to exert downward pressure on housing prices. As a result, housing prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, leading to a slight improvement in housing affordability, although it remained tight. The non-residential property markets remained weak. The office segment continued to face high vacancy rates despite ample supply, while the retail premises segment grappled with challenges stemming from shifts in consumer behavior among both tourists and local residents.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, all junior translators have produced fluent and accurate translations that closely align with the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the English output.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"trade tensions,\" \"fund flows,\" \"regional ties,\" \"inbound tourism,\" \"economic stimulus measures,\" \"tourism-related policy support,\" and \"emerging markets.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved accurately.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate vocabulary for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly more verbose or less idiomatic phrasing, such as \"continuous provision of comprehensive support\" or \"proactive implementation of economic stimulus measures,\" which, while correct, are not as concise or natural as alternatives.\n- The use of \"cutting-edge technology\" versus \"frontier technology\" is a minor but notable difference. \"Frontier technology\" is more commonly used in policy and economic contexts, so it may be more appropriate.\n- Some translations use \"revitalize\" or \"boost\" in the context of tourism, which are acceptable, but \"revitalize\" may be slightly more formal and better suited to the tone of the original text.\n- The phrase \"accelerate its connection with emerging markets\" is slightly awkward compared to \"accelerate integration with emerging markets\" or \"accelerate engagement with emerging markets.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain the original meaning while ensuring the English is as natural, concise, and idiomatic as possible. This involves:\n- Choosing the most commonly used and natural phrasing in economic and policy contexts.\n- Ensuring consistency in terminology and tone.\n- Avoiding overly formal or verbose expressions unless they are necessary for clarity or formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nGiven the escalating trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and fund flows, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, continued multifaceted support from relevant authorities and the banking sector should enhance the resilience of local businesses. The mainland's active implementation of economic stimulus measures, along with significant breakthroughs in frontier technology, should also boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional ties and accelerate integration with emerging markets. Meanwhile, under the mainland authorities' tourism-related policy support and the government's efforts to revitalize Hong Kong's tourism industry, inbound tourism is expected to grow further.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. As rising housing rents gradually pass through to consumer prices, local costs may face mild upward pressure. However, despite increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook, external price pressures should remain moderate. On the other hand, the labour market may face challenges due to the escalation of trade tensions. However, various talent attraction schemes should help continue building a high-quality talent pool, providing support for the long-term development of the economy.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"resilient\" which is a strong and appropriate term for describing the banking sector. It correctly uses \"Credit risk\" with a capital \"C\" as per the dictionary, though this is not strictly required. The phrase \"investment gains from investments held for trading\" is slightly redundant and could be more concise.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"stable\" instead of \"resilient,\" which is less precise in the context of a banking sector. It also uses \"controllable\" for \"asset quality,\" which is acceptable but less commonly used in financial contexts than \"manageable.\"\n3. **Translation 3** has a mix of strengths and weaknesses. It uses \"stable\" and includes the Chinese term \"可控\" in the translation, which is an error. It also uses \"Credit risk\" with a capital \"C,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase version.\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"stable\" and \"Credit risk\" with a capital \"C.\" It correctly uses \"investments held for trading\" and \"income from fees and commissions.\" However, \"both ample\" is slightly awkward compared to \"were both ample.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilient,\" which is a strong term for the banking sector, and \"manageable\" for \"asset quality,\" which is appropriate. It also uses \"investment returns\" instead of \"investment gains,\" which is more natural in financial contexts. It correctly uses \"credit risk\" in lowercase and avoids capitalization unless necessary.\n6. **Translation 6** is fluent and accurate, using \"stable\" and \"manageable.\" It correctly uses \"investments held for trading\" and \"income from fees and commissions.\" However, it uses \"increased investments held for trading,\" which is slightly ambiguous and could be misinterpreted as an increase in the amount of investments rather than an increase in income from them.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2024, with banks maintaining ample capital and liquidity. Amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, the banking sector faced increased credit risk during the year, but the overall asset quality of banks remained manageable. Benefiting from higher investment returns from investments held for trading and increased income from fees and commissions, retail banks saw a rise in profits compared to 2023.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe six junior translations are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in clarity, precision, and naturalness that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original data and maintain the structure of the original text.\n- The dictionary terms are consistently translated correctly, such as \"信貸撥備覆蓋率\" as \"provision coverage ratio\" and \"住宅按揭貸款\" as \"residential mortgage lending.\"\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the rise in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in loan ratings for some Mainland-related property developers\" (Translation 4), which is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n- The phrase \"the ratio of provisions to classified loans\" (Translation 5) is more precise than \"provisions and classified loan ratio,\" which is a bit ambiguous.\n- Some translations use \"Mainland-related property developers\" (Translation 4), which is slightly different from the original \"內地房地產發展商\" and may be less direct than \"Mainland China real estate developers\" (Translation 5).\n- The phrase \"the adjusted provision coverage ratio was approximately 145%\" (Translation 1) is slightly less natural than \"the adjusted provision coverage ratio is approximately 145%\" (Translation 3), which uses the present tense more appropriately in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more concise and natural phrasing, such as \"the increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in credit ratings for some Mainland China real estate developers and small and medium-sized local property developers and investors.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"Mainland-related lending\" and \"Mainland China real estate developers.\"\n- Use the present tense for figures and ratios that are still relevant, such as \"the adjusted provision coverage ratio is approximately 145%.\"\n- Ensure clarity in the explanation of \"provision coverage ratio\" by using \"the ratio of provisions to classified loans\" instead of \"provisions and classified loan ratio.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increased from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in credit ratings for some Mainland China real estate developers and small and medium-sized local property developers and investors. However, the classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024. Bank provisions remained adequate. As of the end of 2024, the provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of provisions to classified loans) was approximately 65%. If the market value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the adjusted provision coverage ratio is approximately 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained at low levels at the end of 2024, at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios for Residential Mortgage Lending and Credit Card Lending  \nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nRetail banks’ aggregate pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the post-tax return on average assets rose from 0.88% to 0.93% during the same period (Figure 7). The profit growth was mainly driven by a 97.0% increase in investments held for trading and a 15.4% rise in income from fees and commissions, although this was partially offset by a 5.2% decline in net interest income. The net interest margin for retail banks narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). Meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banks increased slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks  \nSource: HKMA\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, consisting of a title and a source citation. The dictionary provides exact translations for \"零售銀行\" and \"金管局,\" which must be used as specified.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Retail Banks\" with a capital \"R\" and \"HKMA.\" The punctuation is appropriate with a colon after \"Figure 7.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, accurate translation.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Retail Banks\" and \"HKMA.\" The punctuation is appropriate with a period after the title and a period after \"Source.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is also a strong translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Retail Banks\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title lacks a colon, which is less formal and slightly less standard in academic or professional contexts.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Retail Banks\" and \"HKMA.\" The punctuation is appropriate with a colon after \"Figure 7\" and a period after \"Source.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, accurate translation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"retail banks\" is lowercase, which is less formal and less standard in titles. The punctuation is also inconsistent (no colon after \"Figure 7\").\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"retail banks\" is lowercase, which is less formal and less standard in titles. The punctuation is also inconsistent (no colon after \"Figure 7\").\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use the correct terms from the dictionary, and follow standard punctuation and capitalization rules. The first, second, and fourth translations all meet these criteria. Among them, the fourth translation is the most consistent in punctuation and capitalization, making it the most professional and readable.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 9: Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banks  \nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\nThe original text is \"# 資產負債表走勢\", which translates to \"Balance Sheet Trends\" in English. The dictionary provides two acceptable translations for \"資產負債表\": \"balance sheets\" and \"balance sheet\". The term \"走勢\" translates to \"trends\" or \"movement\", and in this context, \"trends\" is the most appropriate and natural choice.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"Balance Sheet Trends\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Balance Sheet\" (singular) and \"Trends\", which is appropriate for describing a general trend.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"Balance Sheet\" (singular) may be less common in financial contexts where \"balance sheets\" (plural) is often used to refer to the statement as a whole.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# Balance Sheet Trends\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Balance Sheet Trends\" and retains the hashtag, which is appropriate for the format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation, the singular \"Balance Sheet\" may be less common in financial contexts.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"Balance Sheet Trend\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct term \"Balance Sheet\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Trend\" is singular, which may not be as natural or comprehensive as \"Trends\" when referring to a general movement or pattern.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"balance sheet trends.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"balance sheet\" (lowercase) and \"trends\", which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The lowercase formatting may be inconsistent with the original text's use of a hashtag and uppercase.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# Balance Sheets Trend\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains the hashtag and uses \"Balance Sheets\" (plural), which is more common in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Trend\" is singular, which may not be as natural or comprehensive as \"Trends\".\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"balance sheets\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"balance sheets\" (plural), which is more common in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits the term \"trends\", which is essential to the meaning of the original text.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The term \"資產負債表\" should be translated as \"balance sheets\" (plural) to align with common financial terminology.\n- The term \"走勢\" should be translated as \"trends\" to convey the general movement or pattern.\n- The use of a hashtag \"#\" is appropriate to maintain the format of the original text.\n- The translation should be in title case to match the original's style.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is: **# Balance Sheets Trends**.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"banking sector,\" \"balance sheets,\" \"negotiable debt instruments,\" and \"Mainland-related lending.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and data.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and correct.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and clear.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message without ambiguity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly more formal or less idiomatic phrasing (e.g., \"was under pressure\" vs. \"was subdued\").\n- The use of \"balance sheets\" vs. \"balance sheet\" is inconsistent across translations, though both are acceptable.\n- Some translations use \"due to\" while others use \"as a result of\" or \"because of,\" which are all correct but vary in tone.\n- The phrase \"leading to\" is used in some translations, which is slightly more causal than the original, which may be more neutral.\n**Improvements:**\n- Choose the most natural and idiomatic phrasing for each sentence.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"balance sheets\" or \"balance sheet\" based on context.\n- Use \"due to\" or \"because of\" consistently, depending on which sounds more natural in the sentence.\n- Ensure that the causal relationships are clearly and naturally expressed without overemphasizing them.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe banking sector's balance sheets expanded by 4.3% in 2024, primarily due to an increase in negotiable debt instruments (+13.4%). Due to high borrowing costs, loan demand was subdued, leading to a 2.8% decline in total loans in 2024. Loans for use in Hong Kong decreased by 2.1%, while loans for use outside Hong Kong fell by 5.7%, though trade finance increased by 4.6%. Mainland-related lending decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to an increase of 5.1% in 2023. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"consolidated total capital ratio,\" \"Tier 1 capital ratio,\" and \"Basel III leverage ratio.\" The term \"本地註冊認可機構\" is consistently translated as \"locally incorporated authorized institutions,\" which is the most precise and formal option from the dictionary.\nThe primary differences among the translations lie in the choice of words like \"maintained ample capital\" versus \"maintained adequate capital,\" and the use of \"both were well above\" versus \"both ratios were significantly above.\" While all these variations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, \"ample\" is slightly more precise in the context of capital adequacy, as it implies not just sufficiency but an abundance that exceeds requirements. Similarly, \"significantly above\" is more precise than \"well above\" in a formal financial context.\nThe structure of the sentences is consistent across translations, with only minor variations in prepositions and phrasing (e.g., \"compared to 21.1% the previous year\" vs. \"compared to 21.1% in the previous year\"). These differences are stylistic and do not affect the clarity or accuracy of the translation.\nThe best possible translation would retain the precision of \"ample\" and \"significantly above\" while maintaining the formal tone appropriate for financial reporting. It would also ensure that the sentence structure is clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\nThe final translation should reflect these considerations, ensuring that the meaning and nuance of the original text are accurately conveyed in natural, fluent English.\nThe banking sector maintained ample capital in 2024. At the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector  \nSource: HKMA\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, and the junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and consistency.\nTranslation 1 and 2 are identical and use \"Banking Sector\" with \"in\" and proper punctuation, which is fluent and appropriate. Translation 3 uses \"of the banking sector\" and \"Data source\" (lowercase), which is slightly less formal and less consistent with standard English usage for captions. Translation 4 omits the colon after \"Figure 10\" and uses \"of the banking sector,\" which is grammatically correct but less standard in formal captions. Translation 5 combines \"Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\" with \"Data Source\" without a space, which is awkward. Translation 6 uses \"Banking System\" and \"Data Source\" with proper capitalization and punctuation, which is also fluent and appropriate.\nThe term \"銀行體系\" appears in the original text and is listed in the dictionary with two options: \"banking sector\" and \"banking system.\" Both are acceptable, but \"banking sector\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to the broader industry, while \"banking system\" may imply a more technical or structural framework. Given the context of loans and deposits, \"banking sector\" is more natural.\nThe term \"金管局\" is correctly translated as \"HKMA\" in all translations, which is accurate and appropriate.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系\" and maintain the standard format with a colon after \"Figure 10\" and proper capitalization for \"Source\" or \"Data Source.\" The most fluent and consistent translation is:\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 11: Capital ratio of locally incorporated AIs  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 11 shows the consolidated capital ratio of locally incorporated AIs.  \nData source: HKMA\nFigure 11 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are a few areas for improvement:\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: The term \"本地註冊認可機構\" is translated as \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" in most translations, which is correct. However, the abbreviation \"AIs\" is used in some translations, which is acceptable but should be introduced with the full term first for clarity.\n2. **Fluency and Style**: The fifth translation uses \"shows the consolidated capital ratio,\" which is slightly more verbose and less direct than the other translations. The phrase \"consolidated\" may not be the best fit here, as \"comprehensive\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to describe a capital ratio.\n3. **Punctuation and Formatting**: The sixth translation lacks proper punctuation after \"Figure 11,\" which is a minor but important detail for readability and professionalism.\n4. **Use of \"Data Source\" vs. \"Source\"**: While both are acceptable, \"Source\" is more commonly used in captions for figures and tables in formal documents.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use the full term \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" first, followed by the abbreviation \"AIs\" in parentheses if needed. It should use \"Comprehensive Capital Ratio\" as the term is more standard in financial contexts. The caption should be concise, use \"Source\" rather than \"Data Source,\" and maintain proper punctuation.\nImproved Translation:\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions (AIs)  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a financial or regulatory report. It includes a title and a source. The key terms to be translated are “本地註冊認可機構” and “金管局,” which must be translated using the provided dictionary options.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" and \"HKMA.\" The structure is clear and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term \"Comprehensive\" may not be the best fit for “綜合.” \"Comprehensive\" implies thoroughness, while \"aggregate\" or \"combined\" might be more appropriate for a financial metric like leverage ratio.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"combined leverage ratio\" and \"HKMA.\" The phrase \"Figure 12 shows...\" is more descriptive than the title-only format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is less formal and more verbose than the original, which is a title. The use of \"shows\" is unnecessary in a caption.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks punctuation between the title and source, making it less readable.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Leverage Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" and \"Data Source: HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Leverage Ratio\" is missing the \"Comprehensive\" or \"Aggregate\" modifier, which is part of the original term “綜合槓桿比率.”  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Aggregate leverage ratio\" and \"AIs\" (from the dictionary). The structure is concise and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"AIs\" may be less clear to a general audience than the full term.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Integrated Leverage Ratio\" and \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Integrated\" is not a standard term for “綜合” in financial contexts. \"Comprehensive\" or \"Aggregate\" would be more appropriate.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and align with financial terminology. \"Comprehensive\" is a strong fit for “綜合,” and \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" is the most complete and clear translation from the dictionary. \"HKMA\" is the correct abbreviation for the source. The structure should follow the original format: a title followed by the source.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary, such as \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),\" \"Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR),\" \"Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR),\" \"Core Funding Ratio (CFR),\" and \"statutory minimum requirements.\" The use of \"banking sector\" or \"banking system\" is consistent with the dictionary options, and the structure of the sentences aligns well with the original Chinese text.\nHowever, there are subtle differences in tone and formality. For instance, \"remains robust\" (used in translations 1 and 4) is slightly more formal than \"remains stable\" or \"remains sound,\" which are also acceptable. \"Sound\" (used in translation 3) is a strong synonym for \"robust\" and is appropriate in this context. \"Well above\" (used in translations 3 and 5) is slightly more conversational than \"significantly higher\" or \"far exceed,\" but all are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning.\nThe phrase \"the primary source of funding\" (used in translations 1, 2, and 5) is slightly more formal than \"the main source of funds\" (used in translation 6), but both are acceptable. The use of \"respectively\" in translations 1, 2, 3, and 6 is correct and improves clarity.\nConsidering these nuances, the best possible translation would maintain a formal yet clear tone, use precise terminology, and ensure clarity in the presentation of data. It should also be consistent in its use of terms and maintain a professional register appropriate for financial reporting.\nThe final translation should reflect these considerations while ensuring that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly and that the overall message is clear and natural in English.\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remains sound. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio for category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio for category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Figure 13). Customer deposits remain the primary source of funding for the banking system. By the end of 2024, the Net Stable Funding Ratio for category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio for category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four of these ratios are well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, specifying the subject of the figure (the liquidity ratio of designated authorized institutions) and the source of the data (HKMA). The dictionary provides exact translations for the key terms: \"流動性\" as \"liquidity,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" and \"認可機構\" as either \"AIs\" or \"authorized institutions.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses \"Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\" and \"Data Source: HKMA.\"  \n   - \"Data Source\" is slightly more verbose than \"Source,\" but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Identical to the first, so the same evaluation applies.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Source: HKMA\" instead of \"Data Source,\" which is more concise and commonly used in captions.  \n   - However, the line break between the figure title and the source may be inconsistent with standard formatting.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"AIs\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is acceptable but less formal.  \n   - The use of \"shows\" is unnecessary in a caption and changes the tone from descriptive to explanatory.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Identical to the first, with \"Source: HKMA\" instead of \"Data Source: HKMA.\"  \n   - This is more concise and appropriate for a caption.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Liquidity Ratios\" (plural) instead of \"Liquidity Ratio\" (singular), which may be incorrect unless the figure shows multiple ratios.  \n   - Uses \"AIs\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and consistent with standard caption formatting. It should use the full term \"authorized institutions\" for clarity, unless \"AIs\" is explicitly preferred in the context. \"Source: HKMA\" is more concise and commonly used in captions than \"Data Source: HKMA.\" The use of \"Liquidity Ratio\" (singular) is appropriate unless the figure explicitly shows multiple ratios.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 14: Capital Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, specifying the subject of the figure and its source. The key terms to translate are “金管局” and “認可機構,” which must be translated as “HKMA” and either “AIs” or “authorized institutions,” respectively.\n**Translation 1** is concise and accurate, using “Designated Authorized Institutions” and “HKMA.” It correctly captures the meaning and adheres to the dictionary terms. However, it lacks a full caption structure, which may be less formal than required for a figure caption.\n**Translation 2** uses “Capital Adequacy Ratio” instead of “Capital Ratio,” which is a more technical and precise term in financial contexts. However, the original text uses “資金比率,” which is more literally “funding ratio” or “capital ratio.” While “capital adequacy ratio” is a standard term in banking, it may not be the exact match unless the context clearly implies regulatory capital adequacy. The term “Data Source” is also more formal than “Source,” which is acceptable but slightly less concise.\n**Translation 3** is overly brief and lacks the full caption structure. It uses “AIs” as per the dictionary, which is acceptable, but the phrasing “Figure 14 shows the capital ratios of AIs” is not standard for a figure caption and may be confusing in a formal document.\n**Translation 4** uses “Funding Ratios” instead of “Capital Ratios,” which is a misinterpretation of the original term “資金比率.” “Funding” is not the most accurate translation in this context, as it may imply liquidity or financing rather than capital structure.\n**Translation 5** is very close to the best version, using “Designated Authorized Institutions” and “HKMA.” It is concise and accurate, though it lacks a full caption structure with a period after the source.\n**Translation 6** is well-structured and uses “Designated Authorized Institutions’ Capital Ratio” with a period after the source. It is grammatically correct and adheres to the dictionary terms. However, it uses “Data Source” instead of “Source,” which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the exact dictionary terms. It should also follow standard figure caption conventions. Based on the above analysis, the best version would be:\n**Figure 14: Capital Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA**\nThis version is accurate, uses the correct terms, and follows a standard caption format. It avoids overly technical terms unless necessary and maintains clarity and conciseness.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖

香港鈔票\n\n年內金管局舉辦14場有關香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的講座，吸引超過2,600人參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖收銀員及學生，有助提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 美元流動資金安排\n\n金管局推出美元流動資金安排的優化措施，包括將交收周期由T+1縮短至T+0，於5月24日生效。此項恆常流動資金安排可在持牌銀行有需要時為其提供備用流動性，尤其是在5月28日美國開始實施交收周期縮短至T+1的情況下。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。截至2024年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為13,068億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n在2024年，金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）發表15份對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題的研究論文，並透過五期開放取用電子期刊與全球讀者分享研究成果。研究中心亦出版兩份《Insights from MonetaryResearch》，就其近期發表的研究論文為公眾提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究工作外，研究中心舉辦一系列知識交流活動，促進與不同參與者的聯繫。年內舉辦31場以本地參與者為對象的研討會或網上研討會，探討重要貨幣及金融研究議題。在國際層面，金融學院與研究中心聯同學術機構、各國央行及國際金融機構舉辦四次國際會議及五次研討會或圓桌會議，促進就廣泛經濟及金融事務的對話與交流。\n\n這些國際活動包括：\n\n4月11日\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\n\n6月6至7日 「NBER東亞經濟研討會2024」\n\n與美國全國經濟研究所、國際結算銀行及香港科技大學商學院合辦\n\n7月15至16日\n\n與基金組織、國際結算銀行及東盟與中日韓宏觀經濟研究辦公室合辦\n\n10月14至15日\n\n第14屆年度中國經濟國際研討會—「中國及全球貿易結構的演變：挑戰與機遇」\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management

and geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and currency markets have remained smooth and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened during the first four months of 2024 before strengthening for the remainder of the year. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally followed the trend of US interest rates, while also being influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"monetary policy,\" \"monetary base,\" \"US dollar reserves,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Currency Board system\/arrangements,\" and \"monetary stability.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key economic concepts are well conveyed.\n- The use of \"Currency Board system\" or \"Currency Board arrangements\" is appropriate, though \"arrangements\" may be more precise in formal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"monetary stability\" (lowercase) unless it is a proper noun, which it is not.\n- The phrase \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100%\" is slightly awkward and could be more naturally phrased as \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100 percent\" or \"fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\"\n- Some translations use \"structure of the monetary system\" when \"monetary system\" alone would suffice, unless the emphasis is on the structural aspect.\n- The use of \"HK$7.75 to HK$7.85\" is more concise than \"7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar,\" but both are acceptable.\n- The phrase \"must be adjusted accordingly\" is repeated in several translations and could be varied for better fluency.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"monetary stability\" consistently in lowercase unless it is a title or proper noun.\n- Choose \"Currency Board arrangements\" for a more formal and precise tone.\n- Use \"structure of the monetary system\" only if the emphasis is on the structural aspect; otherwise, \"monetary system\" is sufficient.\n- Vary sentence structure and vocabulary to avoid repetition and enhance fluency.\n- Ensure that the percentage expressions are consistent and natural in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from the junior translations, with refined fluency and adherence to the dictionary terms. It would maintain the formal tone of the original while ensuring clarity and natural English expression.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and straightforward: \"貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\". The dictionary specifies that \"貨幣基礎\" must be translated as \"Monetary Base,\" and the rest of the sentence is a standard English construction.\nAll six junior translations correctly use \"Monetary Base\" as required by the dictionary. They also all use the structure \"Monetary Base (Table 1) includes:\" which is grammatically correct and fluent. However, there is a minor variation in capitalization: the third junior translator used \"The Monetary Base (Table 1) includes:\" with \"The\" before \"Monetary Base.\" While this is not incorrect, it is slightly more verbose than necessary and does not add clarity. In formal or technical writing, it is common to use the noun phrase without the definite article unless it is being introduced for the first time in a broader context.\nGiven the brevity and technical nature of the sentence, the most concise and natural translation would be \"Monetary Base (Table 1) includes:\"\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued currency notes and coins;  \n- The Aggregate Balance (i.e., the total clearing account balances held at the HKMA); and  \n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"貨幣基礎\" as \"Monetary Base,\" which is the exact term provided in the dictionary. The translations are consistent and accurate in this regard. The phrase \"Table 1\" is also correctly used to denote the table number.\nThe translations are minimal in scope, as the original text is very short, consisting only of the title of a table. There is no additional content to translate, so the translations are all identical and correct.\nSince the original text is simply the title of a table, there is no need for further elaboration or improvement. The translation \"Table 1 Monetary Base\" is fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate in an English-speaking context. It accurately conveys the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text without any alterations or additions.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is:\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism,\" \"Aggregate Balance,\" \"Convertibility Undertakings,\" and \"Convertibility Zone.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key economic concepts are preserved.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"fulfilling convertibility undertakings\" and \"convertibility undertakings\" consistently, but the phrase \"in response to requests from banks\" is slightly less precise than \"at the request of banks.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"CUs\" once, which is acceptable, but the term \"strong-side (or weak-side)\" is less common than \"strong (or weak)\" in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the strong side (or weak side) of the Convertibility Undertakings\" which is slightly wordy and less direct than \"a strong (or weak) Convertibility Undertaking.\"\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal, but the phrase \"sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.\n- **Translation 5** is concise and accurate, but the phrase \"at the request of banks\" is slightly less formal than \"upon banks' requests.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the ideal, but the final phrase \"7.75 to 7.85 HKD per US dollar\" is redundant since the \"Convertibility Zone\" already implies the exchange rate range.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the most concise and standard phrasing in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"at the request of banks\" is more formal and commonly used in official documents than \"in response to requests from banks\" or \"upon banks' requests.\"\n- The term \"Convertibility Undertakings\" should be used consistently, and \"CUs\" should be used sparingly or only if it adds clarity.\n- The phrase \"thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance\" is more direct and natural than \"thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling Convertibility Undertakings. When a strong (or weak) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars) at a rate of 7.75 HKD per USD (or 7.85 HKD per USD) at the request of banks, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several observations can be made regarding their strengths and weaknesses. All translations accurately reflect the content of the original text and correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Federal Open Market Committee,\" \"Convertibility Undertakings,\" and \"economic stimulus measures.\" However, there are variations in fluency, precision, and clarity.\nThe first junior translator uses \"hedge funds and short positions\" which is slightly inaccurate; the original refers to \"套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉,\" which should be \"carry trade unwinding and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar.\" The second and fourth translations use \"unwinding of carry trade positions and short positions,\" which is more precise. The third and fifth translations use \"covered interest rate arbitrage closures,\" which is less common and slightly off. The sixth translation uses \"unwinding of carry trade and short positions,\" which is accurate and concise.\nIn terms of fluency, the second, fourth, and sixth translations are the most natural, with smooth sentence structures and appropriate use of prepositions and conjunctions. The first and third translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"pushing the Hong Kong dollar to the strong side of the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs) range\" or \"covered interest rate arbitrage closures.\"\nThe term \"兌換保證範圍的強方\" is best translated as \"the strong side of the Convertibility Undertakings range,\" which is used consistently in several translations. The term \"港元\" is consistently translated as \"the Hong Kong dollar,\" which is appropriate.\nThe phrase \"seasonal funding demand\" is used effectively in several translations, though \"seasonal demand for funds\" is also acceptable. The term \"foreign exchange market\" is correctly used in all translations, though \"foreign exchange\" should be used in the context of \"foreign exchange market\" rather than \"foreign exchange market for the Hong Kong dollar.\"\nThe phrase \"the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market\" is slightly awkward; \"the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market\" is more natural than \"the foreign exchange market for the Hong Kong dollar.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would combine the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, ensuring that all dictionary terms are used correctly and that the English is natural and precise.\nHere is the improved translation:\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar slightly weakened as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened, mainly supported by dividend-related funding demand and active trading in the local stock market. In early August, concerns about a potential U.S. economic recession and expectations of faster and larger interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve triggered the unwinding of carry trade positions and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar, pushing the Hong Kong dollar to the strong side of the Convertibility Undertakings range. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from a surge in trading activity in the local stock market following the announcement of a series of economic stimulus measures by mainland China. The Hong Kong dollar then slightly weakened in early November, partly due to a moderation in the rise of the local stock market, and partly because the strong performance of the U.S. economy provided the Federal Open Market Committee with room to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded toward the end of the year due to seasonal funding demand. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rate\nFigure 1 2024 market exchange rates\nFigure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rates\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rate\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rates\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow standard conventions for labeling figures in English. However, there are minor differences in punctuation and capitalization that can affect the clarity and professionalism of the translation.\nThe use of a colon (\":\") after \"Figure 1\" is more common in formal or academic writing, as it introduces the title of the figure. This is seen in translations 2, 5, and 6. On the other hand, translations 1, 3, and 4 omit the colon, which is also acceptable but slightly less formal.\nIn terms of capitalization, \"Market Exchange Rate\" and \"Market Exchange Rates\" are both grammatically correct. However, \"Market Exchange Rate\" is more likely to be used when referring to a singular, specific rate, while \"Market Exchange Rates\" would be used when referring to multiple rates or a general concept. Given the context of \"2024 Market Exchange Rate,\" it is more likely that the text refers to a specific rate for that year, making \"Market Exchange Rate\" the more appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, the use of lowercase \"market\" in translation 3 is less consistent with standard English conventions, where the first word of a title or label is typically capitalized.\nConsidering these observations, the most appropriate translation would be \"Figure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rate,\" as it uses the colon for clarity, capitalizes all major words appropriately, and refers to a specific rate for the year 2024.\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rate\n\nSince no Convertibility Undertakings were triggered during the year, the Aggregate Balance remained relatively stable at around HK$447 billion. Meanwhile, the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased slightly from HK$1,245.5 billion to HK$1,383.9 billion. Consequently, the Aggregate Balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes rose from HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$1,428.7 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The Monetary Base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2024 Aggregate Balance (Prior to Discount Window Activity) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Money Markets\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally follow the trend of US interest rates, with short-term rates also influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations of a cut in the US policy rate gradually intensified, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates softened during the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3). Driven by seasonal funding demand at the end of the quarter and active equity market trading, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates tightened in late September, with overnight rates rising above 6% at the end of the quarter. Subsequently, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates remained largely stable but rose toward the end of the year due to relatively reduced liquidity. For the year, overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong dollar interbank rates fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points, respectively, ending the year at 5.65%, 4.58%, and 4.37%.\n\nIn response to the reduction in the target range of the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was cut three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), falling from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail front, following the reduction in US policy rates, several banks lowered their best lending rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further reduced them by 25 basis points in early November and by 12.5 basis points in late December. Under these circumstances, the average interest rate for new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, Hong Kong's money markets continued to operate normally. Discount Window lending increased from HKD 38.8 billion in 2023 to HKD 50 billion in 2024; the use of the Discount Window showed no abnormalities.\n\nFigure 3 2024 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key term \"香港銀行同業拆息\" and translated it as \"Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates,\" which is the most appropriate and commonly used term in financial contexts. However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the fluency and clarity of the translations.\nTranslation 1 includes \"in 2024\" after the term, which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise than placing the year directly before the term. Translation 2 omits the year entirely, which is a significant omission given that the original text explicitly includes \"2024.\" Translation 3 uses a colon after \"Figure 3,\" which is a standard format for labeling figures and is more visually clear. Translation 4 uses \"Hong Kong dollar interbank rates,\" which is a less common and more verbose alternative. Translation 5 and 6 are identical and correctly place the year before the term without unnecessary prepositions or punctuation.\nThe best translation should include the year \"2024\" directly before the term, use a colon after \"Figure 3\" for clarity, and use the most standard financial term \"Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates.\" This format is both concise and visually clear, aligning with standard financial reporting conventions.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in the face of challenges. Despite uncertainties surrounding the US policy rate and the fragmentation of the geo-economic landscape, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets have maintained orderly operations, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the LERS. The government remains resolute in maintaining the LERS. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated in its \"2024 External Sector Report\" that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the LERS.\n\nA robust banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the LERS. The Hong Kong banking sector continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital adequacy well above international standards. To ensure the banking sector's resilience against shocks, the HKMA has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress-testing results, while maintaining oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated as backing assets for the Monetary Base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Figure 4), mainly due to interest income from investments and mark-to-market revaluation of investments. In accordance with arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), assets were transferred from the Backing Portfolio (BP) to the Investment Portfolio (IP), bringing the Backing Ratio down to approximately 110.08% on September 11. Subsequently, the Backing Ratio remained largely stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's sound banking system, provide a strong backing for safeguarding the territory's monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4 Daily Fluctuations of the Backing Ratio in 2024\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations of the Backing Ratio in 2024\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"non-bank financial institutions,\" and \"monetary policy implementation framework.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- Most translations use \"Currency Board Sub-Committee\" as the term for \"貨幣發行委員會,\" which is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** The use of \"monitoring and examining\" or \"monitoring and discussing\" varies. \"Monitoring and examining\" is more precise in the context of a formal committee's responsibilities.\n- **\"Risk exposure\" vs. \"risk bearing\":** \"Risk exposure\" is the more standard term in financial contexts, and \"risk bearing\" is less idiomatic.\n- **\"Exploring\" vs. \"examining\":** \"Exploring\" is less formal and less precise than \"examining\" in the context of a committee's duties.\n- **\"Frameworks\" vs. \"framework\":** The original text uses the singular \"framework,\" so \"frameworks\" is a minor but unnecessary pluralization.\n- **\"Submitted to it\" vs. \"submitted by the HKMA\":** The phrase \"submitted to it\" is more precise in indicating that the reports are submitted to the Currency Board Sub-Committee.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"monitoring and examining\" for consistency and precision.\n- Use \"risk exposure\" to align with standard financial terminology.\n- Use the singular \"framework\" to match the original text.\n- Use \"submitted to it\" to clarify the direction of the submission.\n- Ensure that \"Currency Board arrangements\" is used consistently, as it is the preferred term in the dictionary.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2024, the topics examined by the Currency Board Sub-Committee included the risk exposure of Hong Kong's banking sector to non-bank financial institutions, as well as the latest monetary policy implementation framework of major advanced economies. Minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee meetings and the HKMA's reports on the operation of the Currency Board arrangements submitted to it are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins  \nBanknotes and Coins  \nPaper Currency and Coins  \nAll translations are accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text, which is \"紙幣及硬幣.\" The term \"紙幣\" can be translated as \"paper money,\" \"paper currency,\" or \"banknotes,\" while \"硬幣\" is consistently translated as \"coins.\" The variations in translation reflect different stylistic choices, with \"Paper Money and Coins\" being the most straightforward and commonly used. \"Banknotes and Coins\" is also accurate and slightly more formal, which may be preferable in certain contexts. \"Paper Currency and Coins\" is slightly more formal and may be used in official or financial documents. Since the dictionary is empty, there are no specific terms that must be translated in a particular way, so all translations are valid. However, \"Paper Money and Coins\" is the most natural and widely understood translation in general contexts.\n\nFigure 5: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation by Note-Issuing Banks as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2024.\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Paper Money and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Banknotes in Circulation and Coins Issued by the Government at the End of 2024.\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and structure that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The key elements of the sentence — the number of events, the topics, the number of participants, and the professions of the attendees — are consistently included.\n- The phrase \"helping to enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes\" is used effectively in several translations, capturing the intended purpose of the lectures.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Word Choice:** Some translations use \"seminars\" (e.g., Translation 6), while others use \"talks\" or \"lectures.\" \"Lectures\" is the most neutral and appropriate term in this context.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The use of \"which helped to enhance\" (Translation 1) or \"helping to enhance\" (Translation 2) affects the flow. \"Which helped enhance\" (Translation 4 and 6) is more concise and natural.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Phrases like \"within the year\" (Translation 3 and 5) are redundant since \"this year\" is more concise and commonly used in English.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** \"Bank tellers\" (Translation 1 and 2) vs. \"bank counter staff\" (Translation 3, 4, 6) — both are acceptable, but \"bank tellers\" is more commonly used in English to refer to employees at bank counters.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"lectures\" as the most appropriate term for \"講座.\"\n- Use \"this year\" instead of \"within the year\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"bank tellers\" for consistency with common English usage.\n- Use \"which helped enhance\" for a more natural and concise structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThis year, the HKMA held 14 lectures on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank tellers, retail store cashiers, and students, which helped enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and punctuation that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Coin Collection Programme,\" \"Sustainability Report 2024,\" and \"Sustainable HKMA.\"\n- The structure of each translation is consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of \"popular\" or \"well-received\" effectively conveys the idea that the program is favored by the public.\n- The placement of the report and chapter titles is generally appropriate, though there is variation in quotation marks and punctuation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"citizens\" instead of \"public,\" which is less natural in this context. \"Public\" is more commonly used in official or formal contexts to refer to the general population.\n- The use of \"featured in\" is slightly more formal and less common than \"can be found in\" or \"are contained in,\" which may be more natural in a general informational context.\n- There is inconsistency in the use of quotation marks and punctuation around the chapter title \"Sustainable HKMA.\" Some translations use double quotation marks, while others use single quotation marks or none at all. This should be standardized for consistency.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"public\" instead of \"citizens\" for a more natural and widely accepted term in this context.\n- Choose \"can be found in\" or \"are contained in\" for a more natural and commonly used phrasing.\n- Standardize the use of quotation marks around the chapter title \"Sustainable HKMA\" to maintain consistency.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use \"public,\" \"can be found in,\" and standardize the quotation marks around the chapter title.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Coin Collection Programme continues to be popular with the public. Details of the programme can be found in the “Sustainable HKMA” chapter of the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# US Dollar Liquidity Facility\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"US Dollar Liquidity Facility,\" \"licensed banks,\" \"settlement process,\" \"T+1,\" and \"T+0.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (the optimization of the facility, the change from T+1 to T+0, and the effective date) is accurately conveyed.\n- The use of terms like \"backup liquidity,\" \"standing liquidity facility,\" and \"ongoing liquidity facility\" are all appropriate and reflect the intended meaning of \"流動性\" and \"恆常流動資金安排.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Optimized measures\" vs. \"enhancements\":** While both are acceptable, \"enhancements\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts and sounds more natural.\n- **\"Settlement process\" vs. \"settlement cycle\":** The original uses \"交收周期,\" which is more accurately translated as \"settlement cycle\" rather than \"settlement process.\" This distinction is important in financial terminology.\n- **\"Effective May 24\" vs. \"effective from May 24\":** The former is more concise and natural in formal writing.\n- **\"Ongoing liquidity facility\" vs. \"standing liquidity facility\":** \"Standing liquidity facility\" is a more precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n- **\"In the context of\" vs. \"particularly as\" or \"in light of\":** These phrases vary in formality and clarity. \"In light of\" is more concise and natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"enhancements\" instead of \"optimized measures\" for a more natural and formal tone.\n- Use \"settlement cycle\" instead of \"settlement process\" to align with the precise financial terminology.\n- Use \"effective May 24\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"standing liquidity facility\" for accuracy and formality.\n- Use \"in light of\" to provide a clear and concise causal relationship.\n---\nThe HKMA has introduced enhancements to the US Dollar Liquidity Facility, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing liquidity facility can provide licensed banks with backup liquidity when needed, particularly in light of the United States’ implementation of a T+1 settlement cycle starting May 28.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe original text discusses the smooth operation of the EFBN Programme and provides a figure for the nominal amount of outstanding EFBNs as of the end of 2024. The translations provided by junior translators mostly capture the core meaning, but there are notable differences in terminology, numerical formatting, and phrasing that affect clarity and professionalism.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"EFBN Programme\" and use \"EFBNs\" or \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" for the financial instruments.\n- The phrase \"continued to operate smoothly\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and fluent.\n- The use of \"as of the end of 2024\" or \"as at the end of 2024\" is acceptable, though \"as of\" is more commonly used in formal financial reporting.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical formatting:** There is inconsistency in the representation of the figure \"13,068億港元.\" Some translations use \"13,068 billion Hong Kong dollars,\" which is incorrect because 13,068 billion is 13.068 trillion. The correct conversion is **HKD 1,306.8 billion** (13,068 billion is 13.068 trillion, but the original text likely means 13,068 * 100 million = 1,306.8 billion).\n- **Terminology:** While \"EFBNs\" is acceptable, using \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" in full on first mention would be more precise and professional, especially in formal contexts.\n- **Currency notation:** Some translations use \"HKD\" while others use \"Hong Kong dollars\" or \"HK$.\" In formal financial contexts, \"HKD\" is preferred for consistency and clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" on first mention for clarity.\n- Ensure the numerical value is correctly converted to **HKD 1,306.8 billion**.\n- Use \"as of\" consistently for formal tone.\n- Use \"HKD\" for currency notation to maintain consistency with financial reporting standards.\nThe best possible translation would incorporate these improvements while maintaining fluency and accuracy.\nThe EFBN Programme continues to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes was approximately HKD 1,306.8 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the key term \"外匯基金票據及債券\" using \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes,\" which is the most appropriate and standard translation from the dictionary options provided. The term \"Outstanding\" accurately conveys the meaning of \"未償還,\" indicating that these are still unpaid or unrepaid instruments.\nThe only variation appears in the sixth translation, which uses \"EFBNs\" as an abbreviation. While \"EFBN\" is a valid alternative from the dictionary, it is less descriptive and may not be as clear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym. In formal or official documents, it is generally preferable to use the full term for clarity and professionalism.\nGiven the context of the title of a table, clarity and precision are essential. \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" is the most comprehensive and unambiguous translation, making it the best choice for this context. The use of \"Outstanding\" effectively communicates the status of these financial instruments.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is:\nTable 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF), published 15 research papers on monetary and financial topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR shared its research findings with a global audience through five issues of an open-access electronic journal. The institute also published two issues of \"Insights from Monetary Research,\" providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of its recently published research papers.\n\nIn addition to research work, the research center organizes a series of knowledge exchange activities to foster connections with various stakeholders. Throughout the year, it hosted 31 seminars or webinars targeted at local participants, exploring important monetary and financial research topics. On the international front, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance and the research center collaborated with academic institutions, central banks of various countries, and international financial institutions to host four international conferences and five seminars or roundtable meetings, promoting dialogue and exchange on a wide range of economic and financial matters.\n\nThese international activities include:\nThe original text is extremely brief, consisting of only a sentence fragment: \"這些國際活動包括：\", which translates literally to \"These international activities include:\" with a colon indicating that a list or further explanation will follow. All six junior translators have provided identical translations, which is accurate in terms of literal meaning. However, the translations are incomplete and lack fluency, as they end with a colon without any continuation.\nThe translations are grammatically correct and use appropriate vocabulary. The term \"國際活動\" is correctly translated as \"international activities.\" However, the sentence is incomplete and does not convey a full thought. In English, a sentence ending with a colon typically expects a list or explanation to follow, which is missing here.\nTo improve the translation, it would be necessary to either complete the sentence by adding the expected list of activities or rephrase it to make it a complete statement. Since the original text ends with a colon, it is likely that the full sentence is intended to be followed by a list of activities, which is not provided in the original text. Therefore, the best possible translation would be to retain the structure and punctuation as given, ensuring that it is grammatically correct and maintains the original intent. No changes to the translation are necessary, as the junior translators have already provided an accurate and fluent translation of the given text.\n\nApril 11th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"4月11日,\" which translates to \"April 11th\" in English. All junior translators have provided either \"April 11\" or \"April 11th,\" both of which are acceptable formats for expressing a date in English. However, \"April 11th\" is more commonly used in formal or written contexts, as it includes the ordinal suffix \"-th,\" which is standard in English date formatting. \nWhile \"April 11\" is grammatically correct and often used in informal or spoken contexts, \"April 11th\" is more precise and aligns better with the conventions of written English. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese and does not provide any contextual clues suggesting informality, the more formal and complete format \"April 11th\" is the most appropriate choice. \nAll translations are accurate, but \"April 11th\" is the most natural and widely accepted form in English. Therefore, the best possible translation is \"April 11th.\"\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\nThe original phrase is concise and formal, indicating a collaborative event or initiative involving two organizations: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The dictionary specifies that \"金管局\" must be translated as \"HKMA,\" which is correct and standard in English.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Co-organized with HKMA and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"HKMA\" and proper capitalization of \"University of Science and Technology.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is not capitalized, which is inconsistent with standard usage. Also, \"the\" before \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\" is correct, but the lack of \"the\" before \"HKMA\" is inconsistent.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Co-organized with the HKMA and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Proper use of \"the\" before both organizations.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Co-organized\" is slightly less formal than \"jointly organized,\" but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Jointly organized with the HKMA and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Jointly organized\" is more formal and appropriate for official contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Jointly organized with the HKMA and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Jointly organized\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing \"the\" before \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,\" which is grammatically incorrect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Co-organized with the HKMA and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"the\" before both organizations.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Co-organized\" is less formal than \"jointly organized.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Jointly organized with the HKMA and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Jointly organized\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The\" is unnecessarily capitalized before \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,\" which is not standard in English.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe phrase \"與...合辦\" is best translated as \"jointly organized\" in formal contexts, as it conveys a clear and official partnership. The use of \"the\" before both \"HKMA\" and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\" is grammatically correct and standard. Capitalization of \"The\" before the university name is not standard in English, so it should be lowercase. The most accurate and natural translation would use \"jointly organized\" with proper article usage.\n**Improved Translation:**\nJointly organized with the HKMA and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJune 6-7, NBER East Asian Seminar on Economics 2024\n\nCo-organized with the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Bank for International Settlements, and the School of Business at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJuly 15 to 16\nJuly 15th to 16th\nJuly 15th to 16th\nJuly 15th to 16th\nJuly 15 to 16\nJuly 15 to 16\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to each other, with only minor differences in the use of \"th\" for the ordinal indicator. In English, both \"July 15 to 16\" and \"July 15th to 16th\" are acceptable, though the former is more concise and commonly used in formal or written contexts, especially when referring to dates in a range. The use of \"th\" is optional and often omitted in such cases for brevity.\nSince there is no dictionary provided that specifies any particular term to be translated, the focus is on producing the most natural and fluent English translation. In this case, \"July 15 to 16\" is the most concise and commonly used format for expressing a date range in English. It is also the format used by the first and sixth junior translators, which suggests that it is a widely accepted and preferred form.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of \"7月15至16日\" into English is \"July 15 to 16.\" This translation is concise, clear, and in line with standard English conventions for expressing date ranges.\n\nCo-hosted by the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office.\n\nOctober 14 to 15\nOctober 14th to 15th\nOctober 14th to 15th\nOctober 14 to 15\nOctober 14 to 15\nOctober 14th to 15th\nAll the translations provided by the junior translators are very similar and convey the correct meaning of the original text, which is a date range from the 14th to the 15th of October. The primary difference between the translations lies in the use of the ordinal suffix \"-th\" with the day numbers.\nIn English, it is common to use the ordinal suffix \"-th\" when writing out dates in full, such as \"October 14th to 15th.\" However, in more informal or concise contexts, it is also acceptable to omit the suffix, as in \"October 14 to 15.\" Both forms are grammatically correct and widely used, depending on the context and style preference.\nGiven that the original text is a simple date range without any additional context, the most neutral and widely acceptable form would be to use the ordinal suffix with both dates. This ensures clarity and formality, which is often preferred in written communication.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be \"October 14th to 15th,\" as it maintains the formal structure and clarity of the original date range.\n\n14th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy — \"The Evolution of China's Trade Structure and Global Trade Structures: Challenges and Opportunities\"\n"}

目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart Money Management

sector maintained stability in 2024. The HKMA swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and ensured banking stability through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided supervisory guidance and supported the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of fintech, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sectoral initiatives, including the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,\" \"Money Safe,\" \"cooling-off period,\" \"generative artificial intelligence,\" \"customer-facing applications,\" \"secondary market,\" \"digital asset-related activities,\" \"Credit Data Smart,\" and \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- Most translations maintain the structure and intent of the original text, including the sequence of initiatives and the emphasis on consumer protection and technological innovation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the full transition of personal credit reference services to 'Credit Data Smart' was completed during the year\" (first translation), which is grammatically correct but less natural than \"was completed this year.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" appears in multiple forms (e.g., \"WMC,\" \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme,\" \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\"). The most appropriate and consistent term is \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- **Tense and Clarity:** Some translations use inconsistent tenses, such as \"is expected to be completed within the year\" (second translation), which introduces uncertainty not present in the original text.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"working closely with the industry to provide an additional Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions for secondary market transactions\" (fourth translation), which can be simplified.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate and consistent terminology from the dictionary.\n- It should maintain the original structure and intent while ensuring natural English flow.\n- The phrase \"completed this year\" is more natural and precise than \"completed during the year\" or \"is expected to be completed within the year.\"\n- The term \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" should be used consistently without unnecessary elaboration.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA introduced the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0 to strengthen bank consumer protection. We also launched \"Money Safe\" to help depositors effectively protect their deposits, and introduced a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA provided guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing applications, and worked closely with the industry to introduce an additional payment arrangement for secondary market property transactions. The HKMA also enhanced customer experience by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the pilot program for Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, and simplifying the procedures for selling investment and insurance products, while ensuring investor protection. The full transition of consumer credit reference services to \"Credit Data Smart\" was completed this year.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Police Force,\" \"Suspicious Account Alert,\" and \"authorized payment scams.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall meaning is preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"suspicious transaction reporting\" and \"transaction monitoring systems.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"increased by 303%\" while others use \"rose by 303%,\" which are both acceptable but lack consistency.\n- **Tense and clarity:** Some translations use \"has received widespread support\" (present perfect), while others use \"received widespread support\" (simple past), which may affect the tone depending on context.\n- **Terminology choice:** The term \"pre-transaction alerts\" is used in one translation for \"可疑帳號警示,\" but the more accurate and consistent term from the dictionary is \"Suspicious Account Alert.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use phrases like \"enhancing the speed and volume of information exchange\" or \"increasing the speed and volume of information sharing,\" which are both correct but vary in phrasing.\n- **Word choice:** \"Publicity efforts\" is used in one translation, but \"awareness campaigns\" or \"promotional efforts\" may be more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Maintain consistency in phrasing (e.g., use \"increased by 303%\" throughout).\n- Use the most natural and commonly accepted phrasing, such as \"information sharing\" rather than \"information exchange.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, such as \"Suspicious Account Alert\" and not \"pre-transaction alerts.\"\n- Use \"received widespread support\" for consistency with the original timeline.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA plays an important role in Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counterfinancing of terrorism regime. By increasing the speed and volume of information sharing through the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, the number of intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% increase in criminal proceeds that were frozen or confiscated. Consultation on legislative amendments to promote bank-to-bank information sharing to assist in detecting and preventing financial crime received widespread support. In April, the HKMA provided guidance based on the findings of a thematic review of transaction monitoring systems, and in September launched a program to encourage the industry to apply artificial intelligence in monitoring suspicious activities. The HKMA also collaborated with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimize the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and enhance awareness campaigns, and issued guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and stopping authorized payment scams.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board has optimized multiple aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme to enhance protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure the credibility of the resolution regime, the HKMA has implemented resolution standards, requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of early termination during resolution. Furthermore, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing preferred resolution strategies for banks, addressing resolvability barriers to ensure sufficient financial resources and operational continuity during resolution, as well as enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA's objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking sector. Achieving this goal requires establishing and maintaining a financial system with a high degree of resilience and capable of providing the essential financial services needed for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system through their mode of operation, or even through disorderly failures in extreme cases. As a regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudent supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" In fact, as the resolution authority, the Monetary Authority aims to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions. To implement Hong Kong's resolution regime, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in wording and structure. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and concise. It uses \"safeguard Hong Kong's currency and financial system\" and \"prevent instability caused by disruptions in their operations.\" However, \"prevent instability caused by disruptions\" is slightly less precise than \"prevent disruptions from affecting stability.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is accurate and uses \"monetary and financial system\" consistently. It also includes \"prevent disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructures from affecting their stability,\" which is slightly wordy but grammatically sound.\n3. **Translation 3** is well-structured and uses \"safeguard Hong Kong’s financial system and currency,\" which is slightly reordered from the original but still accurate. It also uses \"prevent disruptions to their operations from affecting its stability,\" which is slightly ambiguous due to \"its\" referring to \"Hong Kong’s financial system.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 2, with the same structure and wording. It is accurate and fluent.\n5. **Translation 5** is very close to Translation 4, with only minor differences in prepositions and phrasing. It uses \"prevent disruptions in their operation from affecting its stability,\" which is slightly less clear than \"prevent disruptions from affecting stability.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses \"strengthening the resilience\" instead of \"improving the resilience,\" which is a slight variation in vocabulary but still appropriate. It also uses \"prevent disruptions to their stability caused by interruptions in the operation,\" which is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"金融市場基建\" should be translated as \"financial market infrastructures\" or \"FMIs.\" \"FMIs\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- \"金融體系\" should be translated as \"financial system.\"\n- \"金融管理專員\" should be translated as \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- \"透明度\" should be translated as \"transparency.\"\n- \"系統性風險\" should be translated as \"systemic risk.\"\nThe best possible translation should be concise, use \"FMIs\" where appropriate, and ensure clarity in the relationship between disruptions and stability.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). The HKMA's supervision of financial market infrastructures aims to promote the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructures, reduce systemic risk, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures against financial crises can safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, preventing disruptions in their operations from affecting their stability.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted banking licenses to one bank incorporated in Hong Kong and one bank incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also approved a dealer incorporated outside Hong Kong to become a money broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, one restricted licence bank, and one deposit-taking company.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe first junior translator's version is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"granted banking licenses\" and \"revoked the authorization,\" which are standard in regulatory contexts. It also uses \"incorporated in Hong Kong\" and \"incorporated outside Hong Kong,\" which are precise and natural phrasings. The term \"dealer\" is appropriate for \"交易商經紀\" and \"money broker\" is the correct translation for \"貨幣經紀.\"\nThe second junior translator's version is very similar but uses \"incorporated as a corporation,\" which is redundant and slightly awkward. \"Approved a dealer broker\" is also slightly off, as \"dealer\" alone is sufficient.\nThe third junior translator's version has a few grammatical issues, such as \"restricted licence banks\" (should be singular) and \"deposit-taking companies\" (should be singular). The use of \"outside of Hong Kong\" is slightly less concise than \"outside Hong Kong.\"\nThe fourth junior translator's version uses \"established as a corporation,\" which is less common in regulatory texts than \"incorporated.\" Also, \"merchant broker\" is not a standard term for \"交易商經紀,\" and \"currency broker\" is not the standard term for \"貨幣經紀\" in this context.\nThe fifth junior translator's version is very close to the first, but \"merchant broker\" is again not the best term for \"交易商經紀,\" and \"based outside Hong Kong\" is slightly less precise than \"incorporated outside Hong Kong.\"\nThe sixth junior translator's version uses \"banking corporation\" and \"trading firm broker,\" which are not standard terms in this context. It also has grammatical errors, such as \"restricted licence banks\" and \"deposit-taking companies\" (should be singular).\n**Improved Translation:**\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted banking licenses to one bank incorporated in Hong Kong and one bank incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also approved a dealer incorporated outside Hong Kong to become a money broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, one restricted licence bank, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor more information on authorized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices on pages 311 to 314 and Tables D to F on pages 320 to 323, respectively.\n\n# Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\nThe original Traditional Chinese text is \"# 檢討銀行三級制\", which translates to \"Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\" when using the provided dictionary term \"銀行三級制\" → \"three-tier banking system\". The junior translators have produced several variations of this translation, with minor differences in capitalization and punctuation.\nThe first junior translator used \"Review of the three-tier banking system\" with lowercase \"three-tier\", which is grammatically correct but less formal. The second and fifth translators used \"Three-Tier Banking System\" with capitalization, which is appropriate for a proper noun or title. The third junior translator used \"Reviewing the three-tier banking system\", which changes the verb from \"Review\" to \"Reviewing\", altering the nuance slightly. The fourth, fifth, and sixth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original text's formatting.\nThe best translation should maintain the original formatting with the \"#\" symbol, use the correct term \"Three-Tier Banking System\" with proper capitalization, and keep the verb \"Review\" to match the original intent. Therefore, the improved translation is:\n# Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA completed the public consultation on simplifying the three-tier banking system to a two-tier system, with respondents generally supporting the simplification proposal. After considering the feedback received, the HKMA introduced several new key matters to streamline the transition process and minimize the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# Renaming of \"Virtual Banking\"\n\nIn addition, the HKMA completed the public consultation on renaming \"virtual banks\" to \"digital banks.\" The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the HKMA revised the statutory guideline \"Guideline on Authorization of Digital Banks\" in October, with the proposal officially taking effect.\n\n# Review of Digital Banks\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banks, with the review report published in August. The review indicated that the development of digital banks has achieved the three policy targets for introducing digital banks in Hong Kong, namely promoting fintech innovation, providing new customer experiences, and promoting financial inclusion. Under the diversified development of digital banks and traditional banks, the HKMA considers the current number of digital bank licenses to be appropriate, and there is no need to introduce more new digital bank participants into the market at this stage. The revised guideline, \"Guideline on Authorization of Digital Banks,\" issued in October, relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking services beyond retail banking, as well as establishing physical branches under circumstances deemed reasonable from the perspectives of customer experience and business strategy, provided that digital banks continue to primarily provide banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Banking License Fees\n\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, stating that the HKMA completed a review of license fees within the year and raised the fee levels in June. The junior translators have produced several versions that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, grammar, and word choice.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The HKMA completed a review of license fees within the year and raised the fee levels in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"HKMA\" and accurate translation of the main action.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"License fees\" is slightly less formal than \"licensing fees,\" and \"raised the fee levels\" is acceptable but could be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The HKMA completed its review of the licensing fees within the year and raised the fee levels in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Licensing fees\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Raised the fee levels\" is slightly redundant; \"raised the fees\" is more concise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The HKMA completed a review of license fees within the year and increased the fee levels in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Increased\" is a good synonym for \"raised.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"License fees\" is less formal than \"licensing fees,\" and \"fee levels\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The HKMA completed the review of licensing fees within the year and raised the fee level in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Licensing fees\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fee level\" is singular, which may not match the plural \"fees\" in the first part of the sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"HKMA completed the review of the licensing fees during the year and raised the fee level in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"During the year\" is a natural alternative to \"within the year.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" and \"fee level\" is singular, which is inconsistent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The HKMA completed its review of licensing fees within the year and increased the fee levels in June.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Licensing fees\" is appropriate, and \"increased\" is a good synonym for \"raised.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fee levels\" is slightly redundant; \"increased the fees\" is more natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"licensing fees\" for formality, avoid redundancy, and maintain grammatical consistency. \"Raised the fees\" is more natural than \"raised the fee levels\" or \"increased the fee levels.\" Also, \"within the year\" is more precise than \"during the year\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA completed its review of licensing fees within the year and raised the fees in June.\n\n# Hong Kong's Company Registration Transfer System\nThe original text is \"# 香港的公司遷冊制度\". The term \"遷冊\" is the key term here, which refers to the process of changing a company's registered office or location. The junior translators have attempted to translate this term in various ways, such as \"registration system,\" \"transfer system,\" \"transfer of registration system,\" and \"registered office change system.\" However, none of these translations fully capture the precise meaning of \"遷冊.\"\n\"遷冊\" specifically refers to the legal process of transferring a company's registered office from one location to another. This is a formal and regulated procedure in Hong Kong's corporate law. Therefore, the most accurate translation would be \"Company Registration Transfer System\" or \"Company Registered Office Change System.\"\nAmong the junior translators' attempts, the fourth translation, \"Hong Kong's Company Registration Transfer System,\" is the most accurate and natural-sounding. It correctly conveys the idea of transferring a company's registration, which is the core meaning of \"遷冊.\"\nThe fifth translation, \"Company Migration System in Hong Kong,\" is also close in meaning but uses \"migration\" instead of \"registration transfer,\" which is less precise in a legal and corporate context.\nThe sixth translation, \"Hong Kong Company Registered Office Change System,\" is also accurate but slightly more verbose than necessary.\nConsidering all the translations, the best possible translation would be \"Hong Kong's Company Registration Transfer System,\" as it is concise, accurate, and natural in English.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing support to the government in introducing a company migration regime, including legislative assistance related to the Banking Ordinance and other relevant legislation. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nStrengths across the translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Ordinance\" as per the dictionary. Most translations also capture the general meaning of the sentence. However, there are notable weaknesses:\n- **\"Company deregistration system\"** (used in Translation 1) and **\"company continuation system\"** (used in Translation 5) are inaccurate. The original text refers to **\"公司遷冊制度\"**, which is best translated as **\"company migration regime\"** or **\"company relocation regime\"**, as seen in Translations 3, 4, and 6. These terms more accurately reflect the concept of a company changing its registered location.\n- **Tense usage** is inconsistent. Translations 1 and 2 use the present tense (\"provides\"), while 3, 4, and 6 use the present continuous (\"is providing\"), and 5 uses the past tense (\"provided\"). The original text uses the present tense, so the most accurate choice is the present tense without continuous form.\n- **\"Scheme for company transfer of registration\"** (Translation 6) is unnecessarily wordy and less idiomatic than \"company migration regime.\"\n- **\"Legislative procedures\"** (Translation 1) is less precise than **\"legislative process\"** or **\"legislative procedures for amending\"**, which are used in other translations and better reflect the ongoing nature of the legislative work.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would use the present tense, the term \"company migration regime,\" and the phrase \"legislative process for amending.\"\nThe improved translation is:\nThe HKMA provides support to the government in introducing a company migration regime in Hong Kong, including assisting with the legislative process for amending the Banking Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, as well as other legislation related to the HKMA.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 174 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL rating assessments, corporate governance, and risk management of authorized institutions. To continue strengthening the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors of authorized institutions, and 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. In addition, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations of the various operations of authorized institutions, including governance and practices related to credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the increasing adoption of technology by authorized institutions, operational and technology risk management has become another regulatory focus. The HKMA has also further strengthened its supervision of climate risk management by authorized institutions to enhance their capacity to respond to climate change. The HKMA's efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting robust economic growth in an uncertain global economic environment have been recognized, earning it the title of \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" from The Asian Banker.\n\nMs. Zhu Liqiao (Deputy Chief Executive (Banking Supervision), center) represented the HKMA in receiving the \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" award presented by The Asian Banker.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe first junior translator's version is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Deputy Chief Executive (Banking Supervision)\" for \"助理總裁（銀行監理）,\" which is a precise and commonly used title in official contexts. The term \"HKMA\" is correctly used for \"金管局,\" and \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" is the exact translation from the dictionary. \"The Asian Banker\" is also correctly used without the word \"magazine,\" which is more concise and aligns with how the publication is typically referred to in formal contexts.\nThe second translation uses \"Assistant President\" instead of \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" which is less accurate for the title \"助理總裁.\" It also adds \"magazine\" after \"The Asian Banker,\" which is unnecessary and slightly informal.\nThe third translation uses \"Deputy Governor\" instead of \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" which is incorrect for the title \"助理總裁.\" It also adds \"Judy\" as a first name, which is not provided in the original text and may be speculative.\nThe fourth translation uses \"Assistant Chief Manager\" instead of \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" which is an inaccurate title for the position. It also omits the word \"Award\" at the end of the award name, which is important for clarity.\nThe fifth translation uses \"Assistant Vice President\" instead of \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" which is again an inaccurate title. It also adds \"Award\" after the award name, which is redundant and not consistent with the dictionary entry.\nThe sixth translation uses \"Assistant Managing Director\" instead of \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" which is incorrect. It also uses a different transliteration of the name (\"Judy Li-ki Chu\") and adds \"represents\" instead of \"represented,\" which changes the tense and is less appropriate for a past event.\n**Improved Translation:**\nMs. Zhu Liqiao (Deputy Chief Executive (Banking Supervision), center) represented the HKMA in receiving the \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" award presented by The Asian Banker.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA conducts on-site examinations of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, as well as consumer protection matters, and supplements these with thematic assessments to review new initiatives or areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains an overview of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\na. Additional supervisory work focused on operational resilience includes an HKMA investigation and self-assessments conducted by authorized institutions to review implementation progress and identify areas requiring improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at the bilateral and sectoral levels regarding the development of frameworks and practices.  \nb. In addition, supervisory efforts are focused on assessing the strategies and approaches of authorized institutions in approving and managing ongoing risks for specific credit portfolios, such as commercial property and small and medium-sized enterprises lending.  \nc. This includes holding consultative meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the HKMA's Supervisory Policy Manual, Unit GS-1 on Climate Risk Management.\n\n# Credit Risk\nThe original text is a single term, \"信用風險,\" which is defined in the dictionary as either \"Credit risk\" or \"credit risk.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, primarily differing in capitalization and the presence of a hashtag (#).\nStrengths and weaknesses of the translations:\n- The first, third, and sixth translations (\"Credit Risk\" and \"credit risk\") are grammatically correct and use the term as defined in the dictionary. They are fluent and appropriate for formal or technical contexts.\n- The second, fourth, and fifth translations include a hashtag (#), which is unnecessary in this context unless the text is intended for a specific platform (e.g., social media or markdown). Since the original text is a standalone term without any formatting, the hashtag is not appropriate.\n- The capitalization of \"Credit Risk\" is more formal and is often used in titles or headings, while \"credit risk\" is more commonly used in general text. Given the context of the original term, both are acceptable, but \"Credit Risk\" may be more suitable if it is intended as a heading or title.\nImprovements:\n- Remove the hashtag from translations 2, 4, and 5.\n- Choose \"Credit Risk\" as the preferred translation for consistency and formality, especially if this term is likely to be used in a professional or technical context.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is \"Credit Risk.\"\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"資產質素\" as \"asset quality,\" which is the preferred translation from the dictionary. The term \"信貸增長\" has been translated as either \"Credit Growth\" or \"Loan growth.\" While both are acceptable, \"Credit Growth\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and aligns better with the formal tone of the original text.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in translations 2, 4, and 6 is unnecessary unless the original text was intended to be a heading or title in a digital format. Since the original text appears to be a section heading, it is appropriate to retain the hashtag if it is part of the formatting, but it is not required for the translation itself.\nThe most fluent and natural translation would be \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality,\" as it maintains the original structure, uses the preferred term from the dictionary, and avoids unnecessary formatting.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are several areas for improvement. First, the term \"貸款總額\" is consistently translated as \"total loans,\" which aligns with the dictionary entry. However, in the third and sixth translations, \"38,590 billion HK dollars\" is incorrect; the correct figure is \"HKD 385.9 billion,\" as 38,590 billion is an order of magnitude too large. This is a critical numerical error that affects the credibility of the translation.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are mostly correct, but some could be more natural. For example, \"compared to a decline of 3.6% in 2023\" is slightly more natural than \"following a decline of 3.6% in 2023.\" Also, \"Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances\" is more natural than \"Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances.\"\nCulturally, the use of \"HKD\" is appropriate, and the structure of the sentences aligns with standard financial reporting in English. However, the phrase \"related loans in mainland China\" could be more precise. The original text uses \"內地相關貸款總額,\" which refers to loans related to the mainland, not necessarily loans made to the mainland. A more accurate translation might be \"total loans related to the mainland\" or \"total mainland-related loans.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the accuracy of \"total loans\" for \"貸款總額,\" correct the numerical error in the amount, and use more natural phrasing and structure.\nThe improved translation is as follows:\nThe total loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared to a decline of 3.6% in 2023. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances. The total loans related to the mainland decreased by 8.7% to HKD 385.9 billion in 2024 (Table 3).\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"credit risk management,\" \"asset quality,\" \"banking sector\/system,\" \"classified loan ratio,\" \"property developers,\" and \"authorized institutions\/AIs.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically correct, with only minor variations in phrasing and word choice.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and consistency:** Some translations use \"continued to closely monitor\" (past tense), while others use \"will continue to closely monitor\" (future tense), which is inconsistent with the original text, which refers to actions that occurred in 2024 (past tense).\n- **Terminology choice:** \"Banking system\" and \"banking sector\" are both acceptable, but \"banking sector\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. \"AIs\" is an abbreviation for \"authorized institutions,\" but the full term \"authorized institutions\" is more appropriate in formal writing unless the abbreviation has been previously defined.\n- **Word choice:** \"Alleviated\" and \"resolved\" are both acceptable, but \"resolved\" is more precise in the context of debt issues being fully addressed.\n- **Clarity and specificity:** Some translations use \"related loans in mainland China\" or \"mainland-related loans,\" which are slightly ambiguous. A more precise phrasing would be \"related loans in mainland China\" or \"loans related to mainland China.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent past tense to reflect that the actions took place in 2024.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" instead of \"AIs\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"banking sector\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"resolved\" instead of \"alleviated\" to reflect the full resolution of debt issues.\n- Clarify the reference to mainland-related loans to avoid ambiguity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nGiven that interest rates remain high, some mainland property developers' debt issues have not yet been fully resolved, and the local commercial real estate market remains weak, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. The asset quality of the banking sector continued to face pressure during the year, but the risk situation remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector at the end of 2024 was 1.96%, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the classified loan ratio for related loans in mainland China decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% during the same period.\n\nThis year, the HKMA conducted a thematic review to examine the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with key areas including risk exposure to more vulnerable sectors, secured and unsecured retail loans to private banking and wealth management clients, monitoring of credit risk related to overseas operations, and risk exposure to non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\nThe original text is a simple title for a table, \"表 2 貸款及墊款的增長,\" which translates to \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances.\" The junior translators have all provided translations that are very close to the correct one, with only minor differences in punctuation and word order.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations use the colon (\":\") after \"Table 2,\" which is the standard format for table titles in English. The second and fifth translations omit the colon, which is less common but still acceptable in some contexts. The sixth translation, \"Table 2 Loan and Advance Growth,\" is slightly less precise, as it changes the word order and omits the preposition \"of,\" which is important for clarity.\nAll translations correctly use the term \"Loans and Advances,\" which is the standard financial terminology for \"貸款及墊款.\" There are no alternative translations provided in the dictionary, so there is no need to adjust this term.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct. However, the use of the colon is more standard in formal writing, so it is preferable to include it. The phrase \"Growth of Loans and Advances\" is also more natural and commonly used in financial contexts than \"Loan and Advance Growth.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances,\" which is used by the first, third, and fourth junior translators. This version is both grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate for a formal document.\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\n# Alleviate the Pressure on Bank Customers' Fund Flows\n\n# Support Local SMEs\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a vital pillar of Hong Kong's economy, and the HKMA has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing.

The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and formality that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"HKMA\" and \"SMEs\" as per the dictionary.\n- The use of \"introduced\" or \"launched\" is appropriate for the context of policy measures.\n- The phrase \"obtain bank financing\" is consistent across translations and accurately reflects the original.\n- The use of \"support their continued\/sustained development\" is natural and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" instead of \"SMEs\" in the first instance, which is less concise and slightly less formal than \"SMEs.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"its SME coordination mechanism\" with a lowercase \"s\" in \"coordination,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"SME Coordination Mechanism.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"assist... in obtaining\" and \"sustainable development,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly more verbose than necessary.\n- The fifth translation uses \"sustained development,\" which is slightly more formal than \"continued development\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"SMEs\" is more concise and commonly used in formal contexts, so it should be used consistently.\n- \"Introduced\" is slightly more neutral and appropriate for policy measures than \"launched.\"\n- \"Coordination Mechanism\" should be capitalized as per the dictionary.\n- \"Continued development\" is more natural in this context than \"sustained development.\"\n- The phrase \"to help SMEs obtain bank financing and support their continued development\" is concise, accurate, and flows well in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA introduced nine measures in March through the SME Coordination Mechanism to help SMEs obtain bank financing and support their continued development.\n\nNine support measures for SMEs announced in March  \nNine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March  \nThe nine support measures for SMEs announced in March  \nThe nine measures to support SMEs announced in March  \nNine measures supporting small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March  \nNine measures supporting SMEs announced in March  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nAll translations are grammatically correct and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, formality, and clarity that affect the overall quality.\n1. **\"Nine support measures for SMEs announced in March\"** is concise and clear, but the phrase \"support measures for SMEs\" is slightly less natural than \"measures to support SMEs.\"\n2. **\"Nine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March\"** is more formal and precise, using the full term \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" instead of the abbreviation \"SMEs.\" This may be preferable in a more official or formal context.\n3. **\"The nine support measures for SMEs announced in March\"** adds the definite article \"the,\" which is not present in the original Chinese. While not incorrect, it may be unnecessary unless the context implies a specific set of measures.\n4. **\"The nine measures to support SMEs announced in March\"** is similar to the third translation but uses the more natural phrasing \"measures to support SMEs\" instead of \"support measures for SMEs.\"\n5. **\"Nine measures supporting small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March\"** uses the present participle \"supporting,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than \"to support.\"\n6. **\"Nine measures supporting SMEs announced in March\"** is concise and natural, using the abbreviation \"SMEs\" and the present participle \"supporting.\"\n**Improvement Considerations:**\n- The phrase \"measures to support SMEs\" is more natural and commonly used in English than \"support measures for SMEs.\"\n- The use of \"SMEs\" is acceptable in most contexts, but the full term \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" may be preferred in more formal or official documents.\n- The definite article \"the\" is not necessary unless the context implies a specific, previously mentioned set of measures.\n- The phrase \"announced in March\" is correctly placed at the end, maintaining clarity and flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nNine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March.\n\nMortgage customers who make timely installment payments are not required to prepay their loans.

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局於2024年在加強香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」的合資格抵押品範圍；優化「北向互換通」；以及優化一級流動性提供行安排。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強面向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」 策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」的登記數目及交易量繼續穩步增長，於2024年底達到1,580萬個登記，全年平均每日處理港元即時交易增至165萬宗。金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 概覽\n\n在2024年，金管局繼續致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n金管局擴展及優化香港與內地間的互聯互通機制，有助鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場間的橋樑角色。年內，多項有關「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）的優化措施出台，便利粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）個人投資者進行跨境投資。於2月，金管局將中華人民共和國財政部（國家財政部）發行的在岸國債和內地政策性銀行發行的政策性金融債納入人民幣流動資金安排的合資格抵押品名單。於7月，兩地相關部門公布進一步支持境外投資者使用通過「債券通」持有的在岸債券作為「北向互換通」交易的履約抵押品，並於2025年1月實施。此外，「北向互換通」於年內進行優化，增加投資者在對沖策略和管理投資組合方面的靈活性及效率。\n\n在2024年，香港的離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。金管局推出一級流動性提供行安排的優化措施，包括增加提供行數目及擴大安排規模。於年底前，香港人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力提升，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要。\n\n金管局推出大灣區金融合作下的多項利民便商措施，包括促進企業跨境融資的跨境徵信互通業務試點，以及便利香港居民在大灣區置業的跨境匯款支付安排。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港整體金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增強香港作為首選基金管理中心及家族辦公室業務樞紐的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，金管局透過Evergreen項目發行第二批代幣化債券，並推出「EvergreenHub」一站式數碼債券知識庫和「數碼債券資助計劃」，繼續推動香港債券市場創新。於10月，金管局公布「可持續金融行動計劃」，訂明進一步鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的具體目標。\n\n另一方面，金管局繼續加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。金管局在11月舉辦第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期三日，主題為「在變局中前航」，雲集全球各地金融業界翹楚分享各自獨到的觀點。峰會先由國務院副總理何立峰先生作開幕主題演講，接着是三間內地金融監管機構的分享環節，以及由國際金融領袖參與的專題討論。峰會共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的領袖參與，充分體現國際金融界對香港的支持和信心。\n\n年內金管局亦舉辦各項其他研討會及會議，包括：\n\n- 於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    - 開始探索以央行數碼貨幣支持香港代幣化市場的發展；\n- 透過「商業數據通」便利中小企借貸；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n「轉數快」的使用在2024年繼續增加，登記數目與交易量在過去六年穩步上升。截至2024年底，「轉數快」登記數目增至1,580萬個，全年每日平均交易宗數較上年上升33%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量持續增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監管15項持牌儲值支付工具（其中四項由持牌銀行發行）。年內金管局繼續與業界緊密合作，因應詐騙風險上升加強管控措施及保障消費者。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局就在香港實施穩定幣發行人監管制度的立法建議，於2月完成為期兩個月的公眾諮詢後，於7月聯合發表諮詢總結，並於12月將《穩定幣條例草案》提交立法會審議。為更了解穩定幣發行人的業務模式，並制定適切的監管制度，金管局亦推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，並於7月公布三間進入「沙盒」的參與機構。與此同時，金管局繼續積極參與國際組織在數碼資產相關課題（包括穩定幣及代幣化）的工作，確保相關監管框架符合國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n#

tone of official announcements. The key term \"金管局\" is correctly translated as \"HKMA\" in all translations, which is appropriate.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial centre\" is natural and conveys the intended meaning. The placement of \"in 2024\" at the end is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate. The use of \"enhancing\" instead of \"strengthening\" is a minor stylistic choice, and \"financial center\" is slightly more concise than \"international financial centre.\" However, \"internationally competitive\" is slightly less precise than \"globally competitive.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate but lacks the article \"the\" before \"HKMA,\" which is a minor grammatical issue. The structure is otherwise clear and natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very strong. The use of \"status\" instead of \"position\" is a subtle but appropriate variation. The placement of \"in 2024\" at the beginning adds a more formal and structured tone, which is suitable for official communication.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the first translation, with the only difference being the placement of \"in 2024\" at the end. It is still accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation uses the present perfect tense (\"has made\") which is slightly less appropriate than the simple past tense (\"made\") in this context, as the action is completed and specific to the year 2024.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, use appropriate vocabulary, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also place the time reference (\"in 2024\") in a position that enhances clarity and formality.\nThe fourth junior translator's version is the most refined, with the use of \"status\" and the placement of \"in 2024\" at the beginning. However, \"position\" is slightly more commonly used in this context than \"status.\" Therefore, a balanced version would retain the clarity of the fourth translation but use \"position\" for consistency with common usage.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn 2024, the HKMA made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's position as a globally competitive international financial center.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, terminology, and structure that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and uses the correct terminology from the dictionary. However, it uses \"mutual access\" instead of \"connectivity,\" which is slightly less precise in this financial context. It also uses \"enhancing\" for \"optimizing\" in the PLP Scheme, which is slightly different in tone.\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the original and uses the correct terms. It uses \"introduced\" instead of \"launched,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable. It also uses \"HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility,\" which is slightly more precise than some other translations.\n3. **Translation 3** is well-structured and uses the correct terms. It includes quotation marks around the scheme names, which may be more consistent with official documentation. However, it uses \"improving\" for \"optimizing\" in the PLP Scheme, which is slightly less formal.\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 2 and is accurate. It uses \"improving\" for \"optimizing\" in the PLP Scheme, which is slightly less formal than \"optimizing.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses the correct terminology. It includes quotation marks around the scheme names, which may be more consistent with official documentation. It also uses \"aimed at\" which is slightly more formal than \"to jointly deepen.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses the correct terminology. It uses \"launched\" instead of \"introduced,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable. It also uses \"HKMA RMB Liquidity Facility\" without the possessive, which is slightly less precise than \"HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, use the correct terminology from the dictionary, and maintain a formal and professional tone consistent with financial policy documents. It should also be fluent and natural in English. Based on the above review, Translation 2 is the closest to the ideal, but with minor adjustments, we can produce an even more refined version.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, in collaboration with mainland and Hong Kong authorities, has introduced a series of measures to jointly deepen and expand the connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets, including optimizing the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme; expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect; optimizing Northbound Swap Connect; and optimizing the PLP Scheme. These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong's role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"market outreach,\" \"financial services,\" \"HKMA,\" \"green and sustainable finance,\" \"international and regional central banking and regulatory forums,\" \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit,\" \"financial system,\" \"corporate treasury centres,\" \"asset and wealth management,\" \"financial platform,\" and \"bond issuance.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are well-structured and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are slight variations in tone and word choice that could be refined for greater precision and naturalness. For example:\n- \"Significant progress\" vs. \"good progress\" – while both are correct, \"good progress\" may be more in line with the original Chinese tone, which uses \"良好進展.\"\n- \"Robustness\" vs. \"resilience\" – both are acceptable, but \"robustness\" may be more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- \"Mainland stakeholders\" vs. \"mainland stakeholders\" – the use of \"Mainland\" with a capital \"M\" is more appropriate in formal writing.\n- \"Generating a positive ripple effect\" vs. \"creating a positive ripple effect\" – both are correct, but \"generating\" may be slightly more formal and precise.\n- \"Financial center\" vs. \"financial centre\" – the British spelling \"centre\" is acceptable, but \"center\" is also widely used in financial contexts.\nConsidering these nuances, the best possible translation would aim to balance accuracy, fluency, and natural phrasing, while maintaining the formal tone appropriate for a document related to financial policy and international relations.\nFinal Translation:\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, enabling them to fully understand the robustness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and several other major events were successfully held, not only enhancing Hong Kong’s image as a major international financial centre but also generating a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting the development of financial markets.\n\nThe original text highlights the progress made by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, specifically in the areas of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and data infrastructure. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and terminology that affect fluency and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"across various areas\" and \"Central Bank Digital Currency\" (singular). This is grammatically correct and natural, though the singular form may be less common in official contexts.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"in various areas under\" and \"Central Bank Digital Currencies\" (plural). The phrase \"under the strategy\" is slightly less direct than \"of the strategy.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"in all areas of\" and \"Central Bank Digital Currencies\" (plural). The use of \"all areas\" may be too absolute, as the original text says \"各個範疇\" which is more like \"various areas\" or \"different areas.\"\n- **Translation 4** omits \"the\" before \"Fintech 2025 strategy,\" which is not ideal in formal writing. It also uses \"Central Bank Digital Currencies\" (plural).\n- **Translation 5** omits \"The\" before \"HKMA\" and uses \"various areas\" and \"Central Bank Digital Currency\" (singular). The omission of \"The\" is a minor issue, but the singular form is acceptable.\n- **Translation 6** is similar to Translation 5 but includes \"The\" before \"HKMA\" and uses \"Central Bank Digital Currency\" (singular). This is the most grammatically correct and natural version.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best version should:\n- Include \"The\" before \"HKMA\" for grammatical correctness.\n- Use \"various areas\" rather than \"all areas\" to match the nuance of \"各個範疇.\"\n- Use the singular form \"Central Bank Digital Currency\" as it is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- Include \"the\" before \"Fintech 2025 strategy\" for proper article usage.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in various areas of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, including Central Bank Digital Currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"FPS,\" \"Internet Banking Payment System,\" and \"cross-boundary payments.\"\n- The numerical data (15.8 million registrations, 1.65 million transactions) are consistently translated and formatted.\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"FPS\" unnecessarily, such as \"Faster Payment System (FPS) 'FPS'\" in the first translation, which is redundant and unprofessional.\n- **Word Choice and Fluency:** The phrase \"real-time transactions\" is used in some translations, while others use \"instant transactions.\" \"Instant\" is more natural in this context.\n- **Clarity of Purpose:** Some translations use \"achieving cross-boundary payments\" or \"facilitating cross-boundary payments,\" but \"enabling cross-boundary payments\" is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Prepositions and Phrasing:** The phrase \"the connection between Hong Kong's FPS and the Internet Banking Payment System in mainland China\" is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"between Hong Kong’s FPS and the Internet Banking Payment System on the mainland.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Eliminate redundancy by using \"FPS\" only once after the full name.\n- Use \"instant transactions\" instead of \"real-time transactions\" for better fluency.\n- Use \"enabling cross-boundary payments\" for clarity and precision.\n- Refine prepositions and phrasing for smoother readability.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while eliminating redundancies and improving fluency and precision.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe number of registrations and transaction volume for the Faster Payment System (FPS) continue to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024, with the average daily processing of Hong Kong dollar instant transactions increasing to 1.65 million throughout the year. The HKMA is working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the implementation of the interconnection between Hong Kong’s FPS and the Internet Banking Payment System on the mainland, enabling cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA continues to strive to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Bond Connect,\" \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" and \"eligible collateral.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key financial concepts are well conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain a formal tone suitable for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use different names for the same program, such as \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme\" versus \"WMC\" or \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect.\" The dictionary provides multiple options, but consistency is key in professional translation.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as using \"the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the Greater Bay Area)\" or \"the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (the 'Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect').\" This can be simplified.\n- **Fluency and Readability:** A few translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the mutual three-way connectivity mechanisms\" or \"the interconnected mechanisms between Hong Kong and mainland China,\" which are less idiomatic than \"the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland.\"\n- **Implementation Date:** Some translations use \"which will be implemented in January 2025\" while others use \"to be implemented in January 2025.\" The latter is more concise and preferred in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Use the most commonly accepted and concise term for each program, such as \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme\" or \"WMC\" as appropriate.\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Avoid redundancy and ensure that terms like \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\" are not unnecessarily repeated with alternative names.\n- **Natural English Flow:** Use idiomatic expressions and ensure that the translation reads smoothly in English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA's expansion and optimization of the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland help consolidate Hong Kong's role as a bridge between the mainland and international financial markets. This year, several optimization measures related to the \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme\" (WMC) were introduced, facilitating cross-boundary investment for individual investors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). In February, the HKMA included onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China (CMOF) and policy financial bonds issued by mainland policy banks in the eligible collateral list of the RMB Liquidity Facility. In July, relevant authorities on both sides announced further support for offshore investors to use onshore bonds held through \"Bond Connect\" as margin collateral for \"Northbound Swap Connect\" transactions, to be implemented in January 2025. Additionally, the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" was optimized this year, enhancing investors' flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and portfolio management.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's offshore renminbi business continued to grow steadily. The HKMA introduced optimized measures for the PLP Scheme, including increasing the number of participating banks and expanding the scale of the arrangement. By the end of the year, the night-time cross-boundary service capability of Hong Kong's RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System was enhanced to better meet the global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"GBA financial co-operation,\" \"cross-boundary credit referencing,\" and \"Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"facilitate,\" \"pilot scheme,\" and \"remittances for property purchases.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"people-friendly and business-convenient,\" which is somewhat awkward and less idiomatic than \"to benefit the public and facilitate business.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"user-friendly commercial measures,\" which misrepresents the original intent of \"利民便商\" (benefit the public and facilitate business).\n- **Translation 3** uses \"payment arrangements for remittances for property purchases,\" which is redundant and less precise than \"Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"cross-boundary financing,\" which is not a standard term; \"cross-border financing\" is more appropriate.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"pilot program\" and \"facilitate Hong Kong residents' property transactions,\" which is slightly less direct than the original.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate in terms of grammar and fluency, but it uses \"Greater Bay Area\" instead of \"GBA\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"GBA\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"to benefit the public and facilitate business\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"people-friendly and business-convenient.\"\n- \"Cross-border financing\" is more standard than \"cross-boundary financing.\"\n- \"Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions\" should be used as a single term, not broken down into \"remittances for property purchases.\"\n- The sentence structure should be concise and clear, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has introduced a number of measures under GBA financial co-operation to benefit the public and facilitate business, including a pilot scheme for cross-boundary credit referencing to facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises, as well as Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions to facilitate remittances for property purchases by Hong Kong residents in the GBA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Project Evergreen,\" \"tokenised bonds,\" and \"Sustainable Finance Action Agenda.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"family office business hub\" and \"green and sustainable finance hub\" is appropriate and aligns with the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"to strengthen Hong Kong's appeal as a preferred fund management centre and a hub for family office activities\" (first translation), which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluent than alternatives.\n- **Word Choice:** The use of \"strive to enhance\" is repeated in several translations, which, while correct, lacks variety. Alternatives like \"dedicate itself to enhancing\" or \"remain committed to enhancing\" offer more nuance.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"financial sector\" while others use \"financial industry.\" Both are acceptable, but consistency is preferable.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** Some translations use inconsistent quotation marks (e.g., “” vs. '') and punctuation placement, which can affect readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- To enhance fluency, the sentence structure should be varied slightly while maintaining clarity.\n- The phrase \"strive to enhance\" can be replaced with more dynamic verbs like \"dedicate itself to enhancing\" or \"remain committed to enhancing.\"\n- Consistency in terminology (e.g., \"financial industry\" vs. \"financial sector\") should be maintained throughout the translation.\n- The use of quotation marks and punctuation should be standardized for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to dedicate itself to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s overall financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management centre and a family office business hub, the HKMA is working closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment. In addition, the HKMA issued the second batch of tokenised bonds through Project Evergreen and launched EvergreenHub, a one-stop digital bond knowledge base, as well as the Digital Bond Grant Scheme, continuing to drive innovation in Hong Kong’s bond markets. In October, the HKMA announced the Sustainable Finance Action Agenda, outlining specific goals to further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA continues to strengthen its market expansion efforts, introducing Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. In November, the HKMA hosted the third \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit, themed \"Navigating Change,\" brought together leading figures from the global financial industry to share their unique insights. The summit commenced with a keynote speech by Vice Premier He Lifeng of the State Council, followed by a session featuring representatives from three mainland financial regulators and panel discussions with international financial leaders. The summit gathered over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the international financial community’s support for and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also organized various other seminars and meetings, including:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality.\nThe first translation is concise and grammatically correct, but it lacks a subject for \"held,\" which may feel slightly abrupt in formal writing. The second translation uses \"organized\" and includes \"the\" before \"HKMA,\" which adds a slight formality and clarity. The third translation uses \"This year,\" which is slightly more conversational and less formal than the others. The fourth translation uses \"Within the year,\" which is less common and slightly awkward in this context. The fifth translation is very similar to the second, but it places \"throughout the year\" at the end, which is slightly more natural in formal writing. The sixth translation uses \"conferences\" instead of \"meetings,\" which may not be an exact match for the original term and could be misleading.\nThe best choice would be to use \"organized\" as it is more formal and appropriate for an official body like the HKMA. \"Throughout the year\" is a more natural and commonly used phrase in formal writing than \"During the year\" or \"Within the year.\" Including \"the\" before \"HKMA\" also adds clarity and formality.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation would be:\nThroughout the year, the HKMA also organized various other seminars and meetings, including:\n\n- Co-hosted the Joint Climate Finance Conference with the Dubai Financial Services Authority in September;  \n- Co-hosted the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Global Association of Risk Professionals in October;  \n- Also co-hosted an International Financial Seminar with the Bank for International Settlements in October; and  \n- Hosted the FSB Plenary Meeting in December, the first such meeting held in Asia since 2016, bringing together leaders and senior officials from over 50 national financial authorities and 12 international standard-setting bodies.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA also actively strengthened its bilateral ties with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) and the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) in Hong Kong, promoting investment and financial market linkages between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed an MoU with the CBUAE to establish interoperability of debt capital market infrastructures between the two regions and to promote cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to enhance cooperation in the financial services sector between the two regions.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA held the seventh Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue in December, discussing regional and local outlooks and policy challenges, as well as the latest developments and potential areas for cooperation in the fields of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"cross-boundary investment,\" and \"local currencies.\" The translations are consistent in conveying the core message of the original text: the HKMA's efforts to promote Hong Kong as an international financial center and strengthen bilateral financial ties with Thailand and Malaysia, with a focus on promoting the use of RMB and local currencies for cross-boundary investment and trade settlement.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Accurate rendering of the main message and structure of the original text.\n- Generally fluent and natural English phrasing.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The use of \"companies\" versus \"enterprises\" or \"corporations\" is interchangeable, but \"enterprises\" may be more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- The phrase \"one key area was promoting\" (used in translations 1, 3, and 5) is grammatically correct but slightly less dynamic than \"one key area focused on promoting\" (used in translations 2 and 6).\n- Translation 5 uses \"trade settlements\" instead of \"trade settlement,\" which is a minor grammatical inconsistency.\n- Translation 6 uses \"highlighting Hong Kong's competitive advantages,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and slightly changes the nuance of the original.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and formality of the original while using precise and natural English phrasing. It should use \"enterprises\" for consistency with formal financial contexts, avoid unnecessary wordiness, and ensure grammatical accuracy.\nFinal translation:\nThe HKMA visited Thailand and Malaysia in January and May respectively, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and enterprises to promote Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and further strengthen bilateral financial ties and cooperation. One key area focused on promoting the use of the RMB and local currencies for cross-boundary investment and trade settlement, as well as Hong Kong's competitive advantages.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA actively participates in central banking matters and continues to play a leading role in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB Regional Consultative Group for Asia, and also as co-chair of the Financial Innovation Network under the FSB until July 2024. The HKMA also chairs the peer review group under the FSB Crypto Framework and the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA has continuously served as chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets under the EMEAP.\n\nThe original text discusses the ongoing implementation of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy by the HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office in collaboration with banking departments, with the goal of promoting fintech adoption and strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, using \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"fintech hub\" as per the dictionary. The structure is clear and natural. However, \"rolled out\" is slightly less formal than \"implemented\" or \"launched.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate, using the correct terms. However, the sentence structure is slightly choppy, and the use of \"promote\" and \"enhance\" in parallel may be improved for smoother flow.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"fintech hub\" correctly. However, \"within the industry\" is redundant and could be omitted for conciseness.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is fluent and natural, using \"Asia-Pacific fintech hub\" instead of \"Asia,\" which is slightly more specific than the original. However, \"Asia-Pacific\" may not be the exact term intended by the original text, which uses \"亞洲\" (Asia). The use of \"implemented\" is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural, using \"Asian fintech hub\" and \"main measures\" as alternatives. The structure is clear and the language is fluent. However, \"main measures\" is slightly less formal than \"key initiatives.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"fintech innovation\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is an alternative from the dictionary but not the most direct translation. The use of \"key measures\" is appropriate, but \"fintech innovation\" may not be the best fit in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the most direct and commonly accepted terms from the dictionary, maintain a natural and fluent structure, and accurately reflect the original meaning. \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"fintech hub\" are the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. \"Fintech 2025\" should be used as is. The phrase \"key initiatives\" is more formal and appropriate than \"main measures.\" The term \"Asia\" should be used rather than \"Asia-Pacific\" unless the original text explicitly refers to the broader region.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy with various banking departments, promoting widespread adoption of fintech and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives launched this year include:\n\n- Further promote the application of fintech in five key areas by banks, including Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology (DLT);  \n- Advance work on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to understand their benefits and potential use cases, including:  \n    - Advancing the \"Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge\" (mBridge) project to improve cross-boundary payments;  \n    - Further studying the feasibility of issuing \"e-HKD\" in Hong Kong; and  \n    - Beginning to explore the use of CBDCs to support the development of Hong Kong's tokenisation market;  \n- Facilitate SME lending through \"Commercial Data Interchange\" (CDI);  \n- Strengthen cross-border fintech cooperation; and  \n- Promote broader adoption of the Faster Payment System \"FPS.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"轉數快\" is consistently translated as \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS,\" \"商戶\" as \"merchant institutions,\" and \"儲值支付工具\" as \"Stored Value Facility\" or \"SVF.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data points (e.g., 15.8 million registrations, 33% increase in daily transactions) are accurately conveyed.\n- The translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for a report or official statement.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS\" excessively, which can be distracting. For example, in Translation 1, \"Faster Payment System\" is used five times in a single sentence.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the continued increase in paying government bills, paying merchant institutions, and topping up Stored Value Facility electronic wallets or bank accounts via the Faster Payment System\" (Translation 1), which is grammatically correct but lacks the natural flow of a well-written English sentence.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** While all translations use the correct dictionary terms, some translations use \"merchant institutions\" while others use \"merchants,\" which may be inconsistent depending on context.\n- **Clarity of Meaning:** Some translations use \"business payments\" instead of \"commercial payments,\" which may not be as precise in the context of financial systems.\n**Improvements:**\n- **Reduce Repetition:** Use \"FPS\" as an abbreviation after the first mention to avoid overuse of the full term.\n- **Enhance Fluency:** Use more natural phrasing, such as \"via FPS\" instead of \"via the Faster Payment System\" for brevity and clarity.\n- **Ensure Consistency:** Use \"merchant institutions\" consistently if that is the preferred term, or \"merchants\" if it is more commonly used in the context.\n- **Improve Sentence Structure:** Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony and enhance readability.\n---\nThe use of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2024, with the number of registrations and transaction volumes steadily increasing over the past six years. By the end of 2024, FPS registrations had reached 15.8 million, with the daily average number of transactions for the year rising by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the continued increase in using FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchant institutions, and top up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts has been the main driver behind the sustained growth in FPS transaction volumes.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA supervises six designated retail payment systems and regulates 15 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to work closely with the industry to enhance control measures and protect consumers in response to rising fraud risks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, structure, and precision that can be improved. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Stablecoins Bill,\" \"Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox,\" and \"tokenisation.\"\n- The overall structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, and the key events (public consultation, submission of the bill, launch of the sandbox) are accurately conveyed.\n- The translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for a government or regulatory context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and Chronology:** Some translations use inconsistent verb tenses or misrepresent the sequence of events. For example, the second translation says, \"They jointly published a consultation summary in July and will submit the Stablecoins Bill to the Legislative Council for consideration in December,\" which implies the submission is future, but the original text states it was submitted in December.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy or repetitive, such as \"the HKMA also launched the Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox and announced three participating institutions entering the 'Sandbox' in July,\" which can be more concise.\n- **Clarity and Flow:** Some translations lack smooth transitions or clarity in complex sentences. For instance, the fifth translation says, \"In order to better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and formulate appropriate regulatory regimes, the HKMA also launched the Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox...\" which is clear but could be more fluid.\n- **Use of \"Digital Assets\":** The term \"digital assets\" is used in the dictionary with multiple options. Some translations use \"digital assets\" while others use \"DA,\" but \"digital assets\" is more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Ensure correct tense and chronological accuracy.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing without redundancy.\n- Maintain clarity and flow, especially in complex sentences.\n- Use \"digital assets\" consistently where appropriate, as it is the most natural and widely understood term in this context.\n- Ensure that the term \"Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox\" is used consistently and correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA completed a two-month public consultation on legislative proposals for implementing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong in February, and jointly published a summary of the consultation in July. They submitted the Stablecoins Bill to the Legislative Council for deliberation in December. To better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and establish appropriate regulatory frameworks, the HKMA also launched the Stablecoin Issuer Sandbox and announced three participating institutions that had entered the sandbox in July. At the same time, the HKMA continues to actively engage with international organizations on digital asset-related issues (including stablecoins and tokenisation), ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# HKMA's 2024 Overview of Measures to Strengthen Hong Kong's Competitiveness as an International Financial Center\n\nDeepen financial market interconnectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi (RMB) business hub, and strengthen connections within the Greater Bay Area.\n\n- Optimize the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Northbound Swap Connect  \n- Expand the eligible collateral scope of the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility and Northbound Swap Connect to include RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks in mainland China  \n- Optimize the PLP Scheme  \n- Enhance Hong Kong's RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System's night-time cross-boundary service capability to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments  \n- Support the issuance of dim sum bonds by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government in Hong Kong  \n- Facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-boundary credit referencing cooperation  \n- Implement facilitative measures for cross-border remittances for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area  \n- Deepen exchanges and communication between mainland-related institutions and Hong Kong's financial sector to explore business opportunities\n\n# Strengthening Global Connections\n\n- Hosting a series of international events: the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the FSB Plenary Meeting, and a seminar jointly organized with the Bank for International Settlements.  \n- Strengthening market development efforts by promoting Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders, and laying a solid foundation for cooperation with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \n- Actively participating in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums.\n\n# Enhancing the Competitiveness of Financial Platforms\n\nThrough Project Evergreen, drive innovation in bond markets, including assisting the government in issuing the world's first multi-currency digital bonds, launching the one-stop digital bond knowledge base \"EvergreenHub,\" and introducing the Digital Bond Grant Scheme.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1

meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. The use of \"successively lowered policy rates, which was favorable to the investment environment\" is natural. The only minor issue is the use of \"HK$218.8 billion\" instead of \"HK$218.8 billion\" (though both are acceptable).\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with \"reasonably well\" instead of \"generally well\" and \"benefited the investment environment\" instead of \"favorable to the investment environment.\" Both are acceptable, but \"benefited\" is slightly more active.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"fairly well\" is slightly less formal than \"generally well\" or \"reasonably well.\" The phrase \"creating a favorable investment environment\" is more active and natural than \"which was favorable to the investment environment.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent but has a critical error: \"HK$21.88 billion\" instead of \"HK$218.8 billion.\" This is a significant numerical error that changes the meaning of the sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"creating a favorable investment environment\" is natural, and the use of \"HKD 21.88 billion\" is acceptable, though \"HK$\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the fifth, with \"multiple major central banks\" instead of \"several major central banks\" and \"have gradually lowered\" instead of \"successively lowered.\" Both are acceptable, but \"successively\" is more precise in the context of a sequence of actions.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"global financial markets performed generally well\" is the most natural and commonly used in financial reporting.\n- \"Major economies recorded stable growth\" is accurate and concise.\n- \"Inflation declined to levels closer to policy targets\" is a natural and precise phrasing.\n- \"Several major central banks successively lowered policy rates, creating a favorable investment environment\" is active and clear.\n- The correct figure is \"HK$218.8 billion,\" not \"HK$21.88 billion.\"\n- \"Investment return of 5.2%\" is the correct phrasing for \"投資回報率.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nGlobal financial markets performed generally well in 2024. Major economies recorded stable growth, and inflation declined to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks successively lowered policy rates, creating a favorable investment environment. For the full year of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return of 5.2%.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The HKMA is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the delegated authority.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent in meaning and structure. All correctly use the dictionary terms \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund\" as required. However, there are subtle differences in verb choice and tense that affect the nuance of the sentence.\nThe verbs used are \"sets,\" \"has set,\" and \"establishes.\" While all are grammatically correct, \"sets\" and \"establishes\" are more commonly used in formal institutional contexts to describe the formulation of objectives or policies. \"Has set\" implies a completed action, which may not be the most appropriate tense if the investment objectives are ongoing or current. \"Establishes\" is slightly more formal and precise in this context.\nAmong the translations, the first, second, third, and sixth use \"sets,\" which is a standard and natural choice for this type of statement. The fifth uses \"establishes,\" which is also appropriate but slightly more formal. The fourth uses \"has set,\" which may be less ideal if the objectives are still in effect or are not explicitly completed actions.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and formality, \"sets\" is the most natural and commonly used verb in this context. It conveys the idea of defining or determining investment objectives without implying completion or formality beyond what is necessary.\nBased on this review, the best translation would use \"sets\" as the verb and maintain the structure of the sentence as presented in the original Chinese.\nThe final translation is:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Safeguard capital;  \n(ii) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(iii) Ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(iv) Seek to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (i) to (iii), in order to preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a professional or governmental context. The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and fluency that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" for 外匯基金 and \"target portfolio mix\" for 目標資產配置, as required by the dictionary.\n- The core message—that the objectives consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target mix—is preserved in all translations.\n- The use of \"Figure 1\" is consistent across all translations, maintaining clarity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"targets\" for 目標, which is slightly less precise than \"objectives\" or \"goals\" in this context.\n- The second junior translator uses \"Fund’s\" instead of \"Exchange Fund's,\" which is acceptable but slightly less explicit.\n- The third and fifth translations are nearly identical and use \"take into account,\" which is correct but slightly more verbose than \"consider\" or \"address.\"\n- The fourth junior translator uses \"considerations\" for 目標, which is a misinterpretation of the original term. \"Objectives\" is more accurate.\n- The sixth translation is identical to the fifth and shares the same minor issue with \"take into account.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Objectives\" is more precise than \"targets\" or \"considerations\" in this formal context.\n- \"Consider\" is more concise and natural than \"take into account.\"\n- Using \"Exchange Fund's\" explicitly clarifies that the portfolio structure belongs to the Exchange Fund, which is important for clarity.\n- The phrase \"have been reflected in\" is appropriate, but \"are reflected in\" may be more natural in a formal document.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target portfolio mix (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Backing Portfolio,\" \"Investment Portfolio,\" \"US dollar-denominated assets,\" \"Monetary Base,\" \"Currency Board system,\" \"OECD,\" \"member economies,\" \"bond markets,\" and \"equity markets.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and accurate across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and fluent in English.\n- The use of \"OECD\" as an abbreviation is appropriately included in parentheses or as a full name, depending on context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"primarily\" or \"mainly\" interchangeably, which may slightly affect the nuance.\n- The phrase \"providing full support for the Monetary Base\" is repeated in several translations, and while correct, it could be slightly varied for stylistic diversity.\n- The use of \"debt and equity market\" in some translations is slightly less precise than \"bond and equity markets.\"\n- The phrase \"in accordance with the Currency Board system\" is used in some translations, while others use \"as stipulated by the Currency Board system\" or \"in accordance with the Currency Board system's stipulations.\" These are all acceptable, but \"in accordance with the Currency Board system\" is the most concise and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"primarily\" instead of \"mainly\" for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"bond markets\" and \"equity markets\" rather than \"debt and equity market.\"\n- Use \"OECD\" as an abbreviation after the full name for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"in accordance with the Currency Board system\" for consistency and natural phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full support for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of OECD member economies, to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the HKMA is prudently and gradually allocating part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate investments. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target portfolio mix of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, along with the allocation of other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund's investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"primary individual example\" is awkward and unclear. It should be rephrased for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"major exception\" effectively, and the structure is clear and natural. It correctly uses \"LTGP\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" as per the dictionary. The only minor issue is the placement of \"in the Future Fund\" in the last sentence, which could be slightly rephrased for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"major exception\" and correctly applies the dictionary terms. The only issue is the phrase \"the target portfolio mix of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio in the Future Fund,\" which is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second and third, with the same strengths and minor issues. It uses \"determined based on the actual asset allocation\" which is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has a significant error in the last sentence, where it incorrectly states that the rate depends on the \"target portfolio mix\" instead of the \"actual asset allocation.\" This is a critical inaccuracy. Additionally, the phrase \"primary individual example\" is awkward and unclear.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses the abbreviations \"IP\" and \"LTGP\" as per the dictionary, which is appropriate. However, the phrase \"accepts deposits from the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies from time to time\" is slightly awkward in structure. Also, the last sentence is slightly unclear in its phrasing.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"major exception\" is more natural than \"primary individual example.\"\n- The use of \"LTGP\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" should be consistent with the dictionary.\n- The sentence structure should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary wordiness.\n- The phrase \"actual asset allocation\" should be used instead of \"target portfolio mix\" in the context of determining interest rates.\n- The final sentence should clearly state the target portfolio mix of the Future Fund.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from Fiscal Reserves, Government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major exception, as its deposit interest rates are linked to the returns of both the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP), with rates determined based on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target portfolio mix for the Future Fund between the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in phrasing, terminology, and structure. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"EFAC,\" \"investment benchmark,\" \"tactical asset allocation,\" \"tactical deviations,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" \"tracking error,\" and \"portfolio managers.\"\n- The translations are fluent and maintain the formal tone appropriate for financial policy documents.\n- The structure of the original text is preserved in all translations, with clear explanations of strategic vs. tactical asset allocation and the concept of \"tactical deviations.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"strategic allocation as a guide\" vs. \"strategic allocation as a guideline\" or \"strategic configuration as a guide.\"\n- There is inconsistency in the use of \"benchmark allocation\" vs. \"benchmark configuration,\" though both are acceptable, with \"allocation\" being more precise in financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"short-term market fluctuations\" while others use \"short-term market changes.\" Both are acceptable, but \"fluctuations\" is more commonly used in financial terminology.\n- The phrase \"the difference between the actual and benchmark allocation is referred to as 'tactical deviations'\" is slightly awkward in some translations. A smoother phrasing would be \"is termed 'tactical deviations.'\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, particularly in the use of \"allocation\" vs. \"configuration.\"\n- Use \"fluctuations\" instead of \"changes\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"is termed\" or \"is called\" for smoother phrasing when introducing the term \"tactical deviations.\"\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is clear and that the relationship between strategic and tactical allocations is clearly conveyed.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through an investment benchmark, which refers to the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, and through tactical asset allocation, it aims to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is termed \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the HKMA is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the allowable range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the allowable range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Investment Office,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Investment Portfolio,\" \"Backing Portfolio,\" \"derivative overlay portfolios,\" \"macro risk management strategies,\" and \"fixed-income markets.\" However, some translations use \"IP\" as an abbreviation for \"Investment Portfolio,\" which is acceptable but should be defined on first use for clarity.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: \n   - The first and second translations are very similar and both are grammatically sound. However, the second uses \"are executed\" instead of \"are implemented,\" which is more precise in the context of risk management strategies.\n   - The third translation uses \"IP\" without defining it, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the abbreviation.\n   - The fourth and fifth translations are very similar, but the fifth uses \"is executed through\" more clearly than \"are executed through\" in the fourth.\n   - The sixth translation incorrectly states that the staff manage \"the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio\" as if they are separate from the Investment Portfolio, which is redundant and slightly confusing.\n3. **Clarity and Precision**:\n   - The fifth translation is the most precise in its structure, clearly separating the internally managed portion of the Investment Portfolio and how the strategies are executed.\n   - The sixth translation has a redundancy in stating that the staff manage \"the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio\" as if they are separate from the Investment Portfolio, which is not accurate.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office’s staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This internally managed portion of the Investment Portfolio includes investments in global fixed-income markets, and derivative overlay portfolios are used to execute the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its own staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to manage approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain from the market insights and specialized investment knowledge of the external fund managers.\n\nExpenses related to employing external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"risk management,\" \"Investment Portfolio,\" \"liquidity,\" \"external managers,\" \"operational risks,\" \"Three lines of defence,\" and \"risk monitoring.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"sound risk management,\" \"robust framework,\" and \"effective risk management and governance\" is appropriate and commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive phrasing, such as \"The HKMA has established...,\" which can make the text feel monotonous. A more varied sentence structure would enhance readability.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** While \"sound\" and \"robust\" are both acceptable, \"robust\" is slightly more formal and better suited for official or regulatory contexts.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"investment portfolios\" (lowercase) while others use \"Investment Portfolio\" (title case). The dictionary lists \"Investment Portfolio\" as an option, so title case should be used consistently.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations include redundant phrases, such as \"has established... and has set up...\" which can be streamlined for conciseness.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"robust\" instead of \"sound\" for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Investment Portfolio\" in title case.\n- Vary sentence structure to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n- Use \"external fund managers\" as per the dictionary, which is more precise than \"external managers.\"\n- Ensure that \"Three lines of defence\" is capitalized consistently as per the dictionary.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while addressing the noted weaknesses for clarity, fluency, and consistency.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making robust risk management even more critical. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for Investment Portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has implemented a Three Lines of Defence system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major investment risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks), and has established risk management procedures to provide a robust framework for strategic planning and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Responsible investing\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in style, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\"\n- The term \"ESG factors\" is consistently used for \"ESG因素.\"\n- The phrase \"sustainable long-term economic performance\" is correctly used for \"投資的可持續長期表現.\"\n- The reference to the report is consistently translated as \"Sustainability Report 2024.\"\n- The core message of the original text is well conveyed in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in \"負責任投資\":** Some translations use \"responsible investment\" while others use \"responsible investing.\" The dictionary allows both, but \"responsible investment\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **\"適度強調\" vs. \"moderately emphasize\":** The first and sixth translations use \"moderately emphasize,\" while others use \"appropriately emphasizing.\" \"Appropriately emphasizing\" is more natural in this context.\n- **\"環境、社會及管治(ESG)\":** The dictionary provides three options, but the full phrase \"environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\" is more complete and accurate than using only \"social and governance\" or \"environmental.\"\n- **\"指導性原則\" vs. \"guiding principle\":** All translations use \"guiding principle,\" which is appropriate.\n- **\"《二零二四年可持續發展報告》\" vs. \"Sustainability Report 2024\":** All translations use the correct title.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"responsible investment\" consistently for \"負責任投資.\"\n- Use \"appropriately emphasizing\" for \"適度強調.\"\n- Use the full phrase \"environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\" for \"環境、社會及管治(ESG).\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"ESG factors\" and \"risk-adjusted long-term returns.\"\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, as the original text is from an official report.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English expression.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nHKMA believes that appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term economic performance of investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce risks related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the Exchange Fund’s investment management process, with the guiding principle that ESG investments are generally prioritized when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. Details of HKMA’s work on responsible investment can be found in the “Responsible Investment” chapter of the Sustainability Report 2024.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2024\n\nIn 2024, the global financial markets generally performed well.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and emphasis. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"股市\" as \"equity market,\" \"實體經濟增長\" as \"real economic growth,\" \"政策措施\" as \"policy measures,\" \"通脹\" as \"inflation,\" and \"債息\" as \"bond yields.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of financial terminology.\n- Clear structure and logical flow of information.\n- Proper use of time references (e.g., \"first three quarters,\" \"fourth quarter\").\n- Consistent use of terms like \"equity market\" and \"policy measures.\"\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"market conditions became volatile\" appears in multiple versions).\n- The phrase \"the market believes\" or \"the market perceives\" is used in some translations, which may be slightly less natural than \"market participants believe\" or \"investors perceive.\"\n- Some translations use \"mainland and Hong Kong equity markets\" while others use \"mainland Chinese and Hong Kong equity markets.\" The latter is more precise.\n- The phrase \"retreated from their highs\" is used in some translations, which is slightly informal; \"retreated from previous highs\" is more standard in financial writing.\n- The use of \"leading to a decline from peak levels\" is slightly wordy compared to \"retreating from previous highs.\"\nImprovements could include:\n- Ensuring consistency in phrasing and terminology.\n- Using more formal and standard financial terminology.\n- Ensuring clarity in the subject of the verb (e.g., \"investors perceive\" rather than \"the market believes\").\n- Ensuring that the phrase \"mainland Chinese and Hong Kong equity markets\" is used consistently.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the phrasing for clarity, fluency, and formality.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe major equity markets saw significant gains in 2024, with the U.S. equity market performing particularly strongly in the first three quarters amid generally improving economic and inflation conditions, as well as the AI boom. However, market conditions in the fourth quarter became volatile and retreated from previous highs due to concerns over rising inflation and increasing bond yields, leading investors to adopt a more cautious stance. In mainland China and Hong Kong, investor confidence improved somewhat in the third quarter following a series of policy measures introduced by the central government to stimulate the economy and equity markets. Nevertheless, with market participants still viewing real economic growth as uncertain, equity markets in both regions softened in the fourth quarter.\n\nGlobal bond markets experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although major central banks largely established the direction of interest rate cuts, the pace and extent of these cuts shifted several times throughout the year. By the fourth quarter, the market began to focus on U.S. fiscal policy in 2025, and U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply during the quarter, putting downward pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to the interest rate outlook and the relatively strong performance of the U.S. economy.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and equity markets in 2024.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to each other and demonstrate a strong grasp of the core content and structure of the original sentence. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, currency notation, and verb choice that can be evaluated for fluency and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" as the translation for \"外匯基金,\" which aligns with the dictionary requirement.\n- The numerical value \"2,188億港元\" is consistently translated as \"HK$218.8 billion\" or \"HKD 218.8 billion,\" which is accurate and appropriate.\n- The use of \"recorded investment income\" or \"earned investment income\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The phrase \"which included\" or \"including\" is used appropriately to introduce the following details.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"HKD\" versus \"HK$\" is a minor but notable difference. In financial contexts, \"HK$\" is more commonly used in English to denote Hong Kong dollars, so \"HK$\" is preferable.\n- The verb \"recorded\" is slightly more formal and is often used in financial reporting, while \"earned\" is more conversational. Both are acceptable, but \"recorded\" may be more appropriate in this context.\n- The placement of \"which included\" versus \"including\" is a matter of style. \"Including\" is more concise and direct, while \"which included\" is slightly more formal and explanatory.\n**Improvements:**\n- Consistency in currency notation: Use \"HK$\" instead of \"HKD\" for alignment with common financial English usage.\n- Verb choice: \"Recorded\" is more suitable for formal financial reporting.\n- Phrase choice: \"Including\" is more concise and natural in this context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, including:\n\n- Bond investment income of HK$135.9 billion;  \n- Stock investment income of HK$90.9 billion (of which HK$21.8 billion from Hong Kong stock investments and HK$69.1 billion from investments in other stocks);  \n- A downward foreign exchange valuation adjustment of HK$35.6 billion for non-HKD assets; and  \n- Other investment income held by the Exchange Fund's investment-holding subsidiaries amounting to HK$27.6 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.8 billion.\n\nBy the end of 2024, the total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HKD 408.1 billion. The total market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HKD 54.12 billion, comprising HKD 43.48 billion in private equity and HKD 10.64 billion in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HKD 28.86 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with minor differences in phrasing and verb choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Strategic Portfolio,\" \"Investment Portfolio,\" \"Backing Portfolio,\" \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" and \"annualised internal rate of return.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, clarity, and grammatical structure that can be refined for maximum clarity and natural English expression.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terminology from the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent and grammatically sound.\n- The use of verbs such as \"achieved,\" \"had,\" and \"generated\" is appropriate in the context of financial reporting.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"had\" or \"achieved\" in the first sentence, which is acceptable, but \"achieved\" may be more active and precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"since the commencement of investments in 2009\" is slightly more formal than \"since its investment activities commenced in 2009\" or \"since the start of investments in 2009.\" However, all are grammatically correct.\n- The use of \"of which\" in the sixth translation is slightly more complex and may be less direct than the other translations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"achieved\" for consistency and active voice.\n- Use \"since the start of investments in 2009\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Ensure parallel structure in the description of the Investment Portfolio and Backing Portfolio.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use active voice, maintain parallel structure, and ensure clarity and conciseness.\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) achieved an investment return of 5.2% in 2024, with the Investment Portfolio returning 7.2% and the Backing Portfolio returning 4.1%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since the start of investments in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 displays the investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment returns for different periods. The average return of the Exchange Fund was 2.0% for 2022 to 2024, 3.1% for 2020 to 2024, 3.1% for 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2024. For details, refer to the audited 2024 financial statements of the Exchange Fund on pages 203 to 309.\n\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Return (1994 to 2024)\n"}

intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"機構職能\" is translated as \"Corporate Functions,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" and \"透明度\" as \"transparency.\" All translations maintain the core message of the original text, which is that the Corporate Functions Department supports the HKMA's operations with high transparency and accountability, and that the HKMA engages with the public and market participants through various channels.\nWeaknesses include:\n1. **Grammar and Fluency**: Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"maintaining high transparency and accountability, while demonstrating excellent efficiency and professional standards\" (Translation 1), which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluent than alternatives like \"maintaining high transparency and accountability while demonstrating excellent efficiency and professional standards\" (Translation 2).\n2. **Word Choice**: The use of \"maintains communication\" (Translation 5) or \"maintains contact\" (Translation 6) is slightly less natural than \"actively engages\" (Translations 1, 3, 4), which better reflects the proactive nature of the HKMA's outreach efforts.\n3. **Consistency**: Some translations use \"broader society\" (Translation 2, 6), while others use \"general public\" (Translation 4, 5) or \"broader community\" (Translation 3). \"Broader society\" is more consistent with the original Chinese term \"整體社會\" and better reflects the intended meaning.\n4. **Spelling and Terminology**: Translation 6 uses \"Information Center\" instead of \"Information Centre,\" which is inconsistent with the spelling used in other translations and may be a minor error.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while improving fluency and consistency. It should use \"broader society\" to match the original Chinese, \"actively engages\" to reflect the proactive nature of the HKMA's outreach, and ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly and consistently.\n---\nThe Corporate Functions Department supports the HKMA’s operations, maintaining high transparency and accountability while demonstrating excellent efficiency and professional standards. To promote public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, the HKMA actively engages with the broader society and market participants through traditional and social media, the HKMA website, the HKMA Information Centre, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible, responsive, and professional work team, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of all policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media Applications\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"tokenisation,\" \"anti-scam initiatives,\" \"media briefings,\" \"SMEs,\" \"media interviews,\" \"transparency,\" and \"stand-up interviews.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, vocabulary, and phrasing that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and correct across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and maintain a formal, professional tone appropriate for an official report.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"mass media\" instead of \"media,\" which is redundant and less natural in English.\n- The phrase \"close communication\" is used in some translations, while others use \"close contact.\" \"Maintains close communication\" is slightly more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- The term \"routine media inquiries\" is used in some translations, while others use \"daily media inquiries\" or \"large volume of routine media inquiries.\" \"Routine media inquiries\" is more natural and commonly used in official contexts.\n- Some translations use \"enhance public understanding\" while others use \"deepen public understanding\" or \"improve public understanding.\" All are acceptable, but \"enhance\" is more neutral and widely used in official communication.\n- The phrase \"support measures for SMEs\" is used in some translations, while others use \"support for SMEs.\" The former is slightly more verbose but still acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"media\" instead of \"mass media\" for conciseness and naturalness.\n- Use \"maintains close communication\" for a more formal and professional tone.\n- Use \"routine media inquiries\" for consistency and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"enhance public understanding\" as a standard and neutral expression.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"SMEs\" without unnecessary repetition.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2024, the HKMA organized or participated in a total of 207 events, including 14 press conferences, four media briefings, 14 stand-up interviews, and 175 other public events. To raise public awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA held press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as tokenisation, anti-scam initiatives, and support measures for SMEs. Throughout the year, the HKMA also arranged 25 media interviews, issued approximately 600 bilingual press releases, and handled a large volume of routine media inquiries.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**總裁余偉文先生於「香港金融科技周2024」接受媒體即場訪問**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"Eddie Yue accepted stand-up interviews from the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the dictionary terms and is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Omits the title \"總裁\" (CEO\/Chairman), which is important for formality and clarity.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: Acceptable, but lacks the full title of the person.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"Mr. Eddie Yue, the CEO, accepted stand-up interviews from the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Includes the title \"CEO\" and uses the dictionary terms correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"the CEO\" is slightly informal; \"Mr. Eddie Yue, the CEO\" is acceptable but could be more formal.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: Appropriate for a media context.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"President Eddie Yue gave stand-up interviews to the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses the dictionary terms and is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"President\" may not be the most accurate title for \"總裁\" in this context. \"Chairman\" or \"CEO\" might be more appropriate.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"President\" is less common for a corporate executive in English-speaking contexts.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"President Eddie Yue was interviewed by the media in stand-up interviews at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses the dictionary terms and is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"President\" is again questionable as a title for \"總裁.\" Also, \"was interviewed by the media in stand-up interviews\" is redundant and awkward.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The phrasing is awkward and less natural.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"Mr. Eddie Yue, Chairman, accepted stand-up interviews from the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses the dictionary terms and includes the title \"Chairman,\" which is appropriate for \"總裁.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Chairman\" is slightly more formal than \"CEO\" and may not be the most common title in this context.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: Acceptable, but \"Chairman\" may not be the most natural choice for a corporate executive in a media context.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"Mr. Eddie Yue, Chairman, accepted stand-up interviews at 'Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024'.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the dictionary terms and includes the title \"Chairman.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The use of quotation marks around the event name is unnecessary and less formal.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The quotation marks are not standard in English for event names.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\n- The title \"總裁\" should be translated as \"Chairman\" or \"CEO,\" depending on the organization's structure. In many corporate contexts, \"Chairman\" is more formal and appropriate for a high-ranking executive.\n- \"即場訪問\" is correctly translated as \"stand-up interviews,\" which is a common term in media contexts.\n- The event name \"香港金融科技周2024\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024\" without quotation marks, as it is a proper noun.\n- The phrase \"接受媒體即場訪問\" should be translated as \"accepted stand-up interviews from the media\" or \"gave stand-up interviews to the media,\" both of which are grammatically correct and natural in English.\n### Final Translation:\nMr. Eddie Yue, Chairman, accepted stand-up interviews from the media at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024.\n\nDeputy President Mr. Li Dazhi delivered a welcome speech at the Interbank Account Data Sharing Showroom Day.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and follow the dictionary term \"「戶口互聯」用例展示日\" with the correct translation \"Interbank Account Data Sharing Showroom Day.\" However, there are minor differences in title usage and punctuation that affect fluency and formality.\nThe term \"副總裁\" is translated as \"Deputy President\" in some translations and \"Vice President\" in others. Both are acceptable, but \"Deputy President\" is more commonly used in corporate or institutional contexts in English, making it slightly more appropriate here.\nThe use of \"Mr. Li Dazhi, Vice President\" versus \"Vice President Mr. Li Dazhi\" is a matter of style. The latter is more formal and commonly used in official or news contexts, which aligns well with the tone of the original sentence.\nThe inclusion of quotation marks around \"Interbank Account Data Sharing Showroom Day\" in some translations is unnecessary unless the event name is a direct quote or a specific title that requires emphasis. Since it is a proper noun and event name, it should be presented without quotation marks for consistency and clarity.\nConsidering these observations, the most fluent and appropriate translation would use \"Deputy President\" for \"副總裁,\" follow the formal structure \"Deputy President Mr. Li Dazhi,\" and present the event name without quotation marks. This version maintains formality, clarity, and consistency with standard English usage in similar contexts.\n\nMedia representatives actively participated in the activities organized by the HKMA in 2024, especially the third Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day summit received over 10,000 news reports from local, mainland, and international media.\n\nMr. Eddie Yue, the President, accepted a live media interview at the \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit 2024.\"\n\nMr. Ruan Guoheng, Vice President, chaired a media briefing on the establishment of the Taskforce on SME Lending.\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Vice President, delivered the opening remarks at the \"2024 Treasury Markets Summit.\"\n\nTo better engage the public, the HKMA operates six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube), with over 200,000 followers. The HKMA produces creative social media content to raise public awareness of a range of issues and initiatives, such as fraud prevention, fintech innovation, green and sustainable finance, support for SMEs, and major events organized by the HKMA. The HKMA also live-streams the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit on its social media pages, promoting public and industry participation.\n\nPublishing creative content on social media can help raise public awareness of the HKMA's initiatives and various issues.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of a public service announcement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in fluency, formality, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Public Enquiry Service\" for \"公眾查詢服務.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, maintaining the original meaning.\n- The use of \"enhance their understanding\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and fifth translations use \"The HKMA’s\" and \"the HKMA’s,\" respectively, which adds a slight level of formality and clarity by using the definite article \"the.\" This is more natural in English when referring to a specific organization.\n- The second, third, and sixth translations omit \"The\" before \"HKMA's,\" which is grammatically acceptable but slightly less formal and may sound abrupt.\n- The fourth translation uses \"key functions\" instead of \"main functions.\" While both are correct, \"main functions\" is more aligned with the original Chinese term \"主要職能.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"the public\" instead of \"citizens.\" While both are acceptable, \"citizens\" is more specific and aligns better with the original term \"市民.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"The HKMA’s\" to add clarity and formality.\n- Use \"main functions\" to align with the original term.\n- Use \"citizens\" to match the original term \"市民.\"\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides citizens with an effective channel to enhance their understanding of the HKMA’s main functions and operations.\n\nIn 2024, the Public Enquiry Service handled a total of 9,594 enquiries (Figure 1), all of which were responded to within the HKMA’s service commitment timeframe (Table 1). Approximately half of these enquiries related to consumer banking, financial infrastructure, debt market development, banking policies and regulations, and notes and coins (Figure 2). Common enquiries included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing. The key terms \"公眾查詢總數\" are translated as either \"Public Queries\" or \"Public Inquiries,\" both of which are acceptable. However, \"Inquiries\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official or statistical contexts, making it a more appropriate choice for a title like this. Additionally, the use of \"Total Number of\" is more precise than \"Total,\" which is more concise but slightly less formal. Given the context of a figure title, \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" strikes the best balance between clarity, formality, and precision.\n\nFigure 2: Inquiries Received in 2024 Categorized by Nature\n\n# Publication\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published the \"2023 Annual Report\" and the \"2023 Sustainability Report.\" The \"2023 Sustainability Report\" received a Merit Award in the \"Public\/Non-profit Organizations (Large)\" category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants' \"Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2024.\" In addition, the \"2023 Annual Report\" won a Bronze Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category of the Hong Kong Management Association's 2024 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin and published:\n\n- Two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report  \n- Four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin; and  \n- 14 articles from *Hui Si*.\nTwo issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report  \nFour issues of the Quarterly Bulletin; and  \n14 articles from \"Hui Si.\"\nTwo issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report  \nFour issues of the Quarterly Bulletin; and  \n14 articles from the \"Thoughts on Exchange Rates\" series.\nTwo issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report  \nFour issues of the Quarterly Bulletin; and  \n14 articles from *Hui Si*.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate in terms of terminology, as they all correctly use the dictionary terms \"Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report\" and \"Quarterly Bulletin.\" However, there are notable differences in the treatment of the term \"匯思\" (Hui Si), which appears in the third item.\nThe first junior translator translates \"匯思\" as \"Insight publication,\" which is a reasonable interpretation but lacks specificity and does not reflect the original term. The second junior translator uses \"Exchange Thoughts,\" which is a direct translation but may not be the most natural or commonly used term in English. The third and sixth junior translators use \"*Hui Si*\" with italics, which is appropriate for a publication or series name. The fourth junior translator uses \"Hui Si\" in quotation marks, which is also acceptable but less formal. The fifth junior translator translates \"匯思\" as \"Thoughts on Exchange Rates,\" which is a more interpretive and less direct translation and may not be accurate if \"Hui Si\" is the actual name of the publication.\nThe best approach is to use the term \"Hui Si\" as it is, either italicized or in quotation marks, to preserve the original name of the publication. This maintains clarity and avoids misinterpretation. Italicizing the term is more suitable for a formal or official publication name.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\n- Two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report  \n- Four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin; and  \n- 14 articles from *Hui Si*.\n\n# Organization Website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some demonstrating a strong grasp of the required terminology and fluency, while others contain errors or awkward phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but has a redundancy: “for the public to access the latest information on the HKMA” is unnecessarily repetitive, as the purpose of the website is already clear. Also, the phrase “maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance” is repeated unnecessarily for the “register of authorized institutions and local representative offices,” which is not ideal for readability.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It uses “the institution’s website” instead of “HKMA’s website,” which is slightly less direct but still acceptable. The use of “AIs” is appropriate and consistent with the dictionary. However, it omits the name of the register for “authorized institutions and local representative offices,” which is a minor oversight.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses “HKMA's website” directly, which is preferable. The use of “facilitating the public's access” is natural and well-structured. The register names are correctly capitalized and match the dictionary entries. This is a strong candidate for the best translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has several issues. It incorrectly translates “認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊” as “local representative offices record” instead of “register of authorized institutions and local representative offices.” It also uses “filed under” instead of “maintained under,” which is less precise in a legal context. Additionally, the phrase “stored value facility (SVF) licensees record” is not in the dictionary and is awkwardly phrased.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses “HKMA’s website” and correctly lists all the registers. The use of “hosts” is slightly more formal than “contains,” which is appropriate for a government website. The only minor issue is the use of “as well as the'register of securities staff of AIs,'” which lacks a comma before “and,” though this is a minor grammatical point.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and well-written. It uses “the institution's website” but otherwise follows the dictionary entries precisely. The use of “kept in accordance with” is slightly more formal than “maintained under,” but it is still correct. The only minor issue is the use of “versions of information” instead of “versions of the information,” which is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and fluent, using the correct terminology from the dictionary. It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the third and sixth translations are the strongest, with the third being slightly more direct and natural in its phrasing.\n---\nThe HKMA’s website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 73,000 pages of information in both English and Chinese (traditional and simplified characters), facilitating public access to the latest information from the HKMA. The website also contains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of AIs,\" maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, consistency, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"開放API\" is consistently translated as either \"Open API\" or \"Open Application Programming Interface (Open API)\" as per the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely clear and follows the original meaning of the text.\n- The use of \"as of the end of 2024\" or \"by the end of 2024\" is appropriate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"progressively\" or \"gradually\" to translate \"分階段\", which is acceptable but \"in phases\" is more direct and commonly used in such contexts.\n- The phrase \"we have launched a total of 177 sets of Open APIs\" is slightly repetitive and could be more concise, such as \"we have launched a total of 177 Open APIs.\"\n- The use of \"portal website\" in some translations is redundant, as \"portal\" already implies a website.\n- The phrase \"For more detailed information about the HKMA Open API\" should be \"For more detailed information about the HKMA’s Open APIs\" to match the plural \"APIs\" used earlier.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"in phases\" to translate \"分階段\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"launched a total of 177 Open APIs\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Replace \"portal website\" with \"portal\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of possessive forms, such as \"HKMA’s Open APIs.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website in phases through Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) since 2018. As of the end of 2024, we have launched a total of 177 Open APIs on the website according to the original plan.

However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (location, purpose, and features of the Information Centre) is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"exhibition hall,\" \"library,\" \"monetary and banking matters,\" and \"research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Building Name:** There is inconsistency in the translation of \"國際金融中心2期.\" Some versions use \"International Finance Centre Phase 2,\" others use \"International Financial Centre Phase 2,\" and one even uses \"Two International Finance Centre\" or \"International Finance Centre Tower 2.\" The correct and most commonly used term is \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"data\" or \"resources\" when the original text uses \"資料與展品,\" which is more accurately translated as \"materials and exhibits.\" Additionally, \"enhance public understanding\" is more natural than \"enhance public awareness\" in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are slightly wordy or repetitive, such as using \"introduces the HKMA's work\" twice in the same sentence.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The translation should use the most standard and widely accepted term for the building: \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\n- The phrase \"materials and exhibits\" is more natural and accurate than \"data and exhibits\" or \"resources and exhibits.\"\n- The sentence structure should be concise and fluent, avoiding redundancy while maintaining clarity and accuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2 and is divided into two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. It aims to introduce the public to the work of the HKMA and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The exhibition hall provides an interactive introduction to the HKMA's operations as well as the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors, and also offers materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe original text provides factual data about the number of visitors to an information center and the number of guided tours provided. All six translations capture the core meaning accurately, with minor differences in phrasing and word choice. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, \"within the year\" is slightly awkward compared to \"this year\" or \"during the year.\" The use of \"guided tours\" is appropriate, but \"provided guided tours to schools and other groups more than 570 times\" is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is concise and fluent. \"Hosted\" is a good choice for \"接待,\" and \"a 120% increase\" is more natural than \"an increase of about 120%.\" The use of \"over 570 guided tours\" is clear and concise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is very similar to the second, with \"welcomed\" instead of \"hosted.\" \"Welcomed\" is slightly more personable and appropriate for a public service like an information center. The structure is fluent and natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. \"Representing a 120% increase\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but still correct. The phrase \"more than 570 times\" is slightly less concise than \"over 570 times.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: The use of \"within the year\" is slightly awkward, and \"approximately\" is more precise than \"about.\" The phrase \"guided tours more than 570 times for schools and other groups\" is slightly less clear than placing the number directly after \"provided.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most concise and natural version. \"Welcomed\" is appropriate, \"an increase of approximately 120%\" is precise, and \"over 570 guided tours\" is clear and concise.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best version should be concise, natural, and use appropriate verbs for the context. \"Welcomed\" is more personable and suitable for an information center. \"Over 570 guided tours\" is more concise than \"more than 570 times.\" The phrase \"an increase of approximately 120%\" is precise and natural.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Information Center welcomed over 68,000 visitors this year, an increase of approximately 120% compared to 2023. It also provided over 570 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but it incorrectly includes \"the Banking Ordinance\" as a topic covered by the library, which is not the case. It should be a reference to the legal document, not a subject of the library's collection. Also, \"local representative offices records\" is not a dictionary term and should be \"register of local representative offices.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" and includes both required registers. However, it uses \"section 20\" instead of \"Section 20\" (with a capital \"S\"), which is a minor stylistic issue.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and \"Register of Securities Staff of AIs\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"Section 20\" with a capital \"S\" and \"public reference,\" which is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"AIs\" for \"認可機構\" and correctly references the two required registers. However, it uses \"section 20\" without a capital \"S,\" which is a minor inconsistency.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and \"Register of Securities Staff of AIs\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"Section 20\" with a capital \"S\" and \"public reference,\" which is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" and includes both required registers. However, it uses \"section 20\" without a capital \"S,\" which is a minor inconsistency.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"AIs\" or \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" depending on context.\n- Use the exact dictionary terms for \"《銀行業條例》\" (Banking Ordinance), \"本地代表辦事處\" (local representative offices), and \"認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊\" (register of securities staff of AIs).\n- Ensure proper capitalization of \"Section 20\" and use of \"public reference\" or \"public inspection\" as appropriate.\n- Maintain fluency and natural English phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the third and fifth translations, ensuring correct terminology, proper capitalization, and natural phrasing.\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses a collection of over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of AIs\" as stipulated by Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, for public reference.\n\nKindergarten students participated in a guided tour of the Information Centre to learn about the design of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nInformation center staff introduced visitors to a mosaic artwork made from Hong Kong coins depicting the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\nThe original Traditional Chinese text is \"# 社區聯繫及公眾教育\". The term \"社區聯繫\" can be translated as \"Community Engagement,\" \"Community Contact,\" or \"Community Liaison,\" while \"公眾教育\" is consistently translated as \"Public Education.\" Among the junior translators' versions, \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" (used by the first, third, and fourth translators) is the most natural and widely accepted translation in English, as \"engagement\" conveys active involvement and interaction, which aligns well with the intent of \"聯繫\" in this context. \"Community Liaison\" (used by the fifth translator) is less common and typically refers to a specific role or function rather than a general concept. \"Community Contact\" (used by the second and sixth translators) is also less idiomatic and may imply a more passive or transactional relationship. The use of the hashtag \"#\" in the original text is preserved in some translations, but it is not necessary in English unless the context specifically requires it. Therefore, the best translation is \"Community Engagement and Public Education,\" which is both accurate and natural in English.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA's work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998, with over 68,000 participants to date. In 2024, we held an online seminar that attracted more than 800 students and teachers from 41 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, fraud prevention, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green financing, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nWe use various channels to contact and educate the public, reminding them how to be savvy and responsible financial services consumers. The 2024 activities attracted a total of over 67,000 citizens.\n\nTo align with the trends of digital payments and green living, we promote through social media and radio, encouraging citizens to give out electronic lai sees during the Lunar New Year period, and also consider distributing physical lai sees using \"good-as-new banknotes.\"\n\nProducing an animated short film to encourage the distribution of electronic lai sees.\n\n# Anti-Scam Song — \"Don't Randomly Click Links\"\n\nTo further strengthen anti-fraud efforts, we have launched an anti-fraud song performed by Mr. Jackson Wan Kwong and Mr. Yuen Kwok Hang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), reminding citizens to \"not take fake links as real, and not let people deceive you,\" and to properly safeguard sensitive personal information and credit card details. The effectiveness of the cross-media promotion campaign has been recognized, earning international acclaim.\n\nVice President Mr. Ruan Guoheng (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\n\nCross-media promotion activities strengthen the public's awareness against fraud.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater fluency and clarity.\nFirst, the term \"跨媒體宣傳\" is consistently translated as \"cross-media promotion,\" which is correct according to the dictionary. However, the choice between \"activities,\" \"campaigns,\" and \"campaign\" as the noun following \"cross-media promotion\" varies among the translations. \"Campaign\" is more specific and implies a structured, organized effort, which may be more appropriate in this context than \"activities\" or \"campaigns.\" \nSecond, the phrase \"strengthen the public's awareness against fraud\" and \"enhance public awareness of fraud prevention\" both convey the intended meaning, but \"awareness of fraud prevention\" is more natural and commonly used in English than \"awareness against fraud.\" Additionally, \"enhance\" is a more precise and commonly used verb in this context than \"strengthen.\"\nThird, the use of \"the public's\" versus \"public\" is a matter of style. While both are grammatically correct, \"public\" without the article is more concise and commonly used in formal writing.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"cross-media promotion campaign\" to emphasize the organized nature of the effort, \"enhance\" as the verb for clarity and precision, and \"public awareness of fraud prevention\" for natural phrasing. The final translation should be concise, clear, and stylistically appropriate for formal English.\nCross-media promotion campaign enhances public awareness of fraud prevention.\n\n# Cross-Border Wealth Management: New Opportunities (TV Short Film Series)\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Northbound Scheme,\" \"Southbound Scheme,\" \"risk management,\" and \"social media platforms.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about the short film series and its purpose is preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"cross-boundary investment\" and \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"short film series\" instead of \"television short film series,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"helping the public further understand\" which is grammatically correct but less formal than alternatives.\n- **Translation 2** is very close to the ideal version, with natural phrasing and accurate use of terms. However, it uses \"iconic scenes\" instead of \"classic scenes,\" which is a minor deviation.\n- **Translation 3** is overly verbose, repeating the full name of the scheme multiple times unnecessarily, which can be distracting.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management New Opportunities\" as the title, which is less natural than the alternatives. It also uses \"digital channels\" instead of \"digital platforms.\"\n- **Translation 5** is fluent and accurate, using \"video series\" instead of \"television short film series,\" which is acceptable but slightly less specific.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"short television programs\" instead of \"television short film series,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"digital channels\" again.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the most natural and precise terms, such as \"television short film series\" or \"television short film series.\"\n- The title should be translated as \"New Opportunities in Cross-boundary Wealth Management\" to match the original.\n- \"Classic scenes\" is more appropriate than \"iconic scenes\" or \"popular scenes\" in this context.\n- The full name of the scheme should be used once, with the acronym \"WMC\" in parentheses for clarity.\n- \"Digital platforms\" is more standard than \"digital channels\" or \"digital.\"\n- The phrase \"help the public further understand\" is acceptable but can be refined to \"help the public better understand\" for improved fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has collaborated with a local television station to produce a television short film series titled \"New Opportunities in Cross-boundary Wealth Management,\" helping the public better understand the opportunities and convenience that the \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme\" (WMC) brings to retail investors in cross-boundary investment. This short film series uses \"classic scenes\" from five popular Hong Kong films to explain the framework of the WMC, investor eligibility requirements, the products offered under the Northbound Scheme and Southbound Scheme, risk management, and matters to note in cross-boundary investment. It will be promoted through television, digital platforms, and social media platforms.\n\nThe original text is concise and straightforward: \"短片以風趣幽默的方式介紹「跨境理財通」.\" The key term here is 「跨境理財通」, which must be translated using one of the provided alternatives from the dictionary. The junior translators have produced six variations, each with slight differences in word choice and phrasing.\nStrengths of the translations include the accurate use of the term \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" in most cases, and the use of adjectives like \"humorous,\" \"witty,\" and \"engaging\" to convey the tone of the short film. However, there are notable weaknesses. The first, second, third, and sixth translations use \"short film,\" while the fourth and fifth use \"short video.\" \"Short film\" is more appropriate for a cinematic or narrative piece, while \"short video\" suggests a more informal or digital format. Given the context of introducing a financial scheme, \"short film\" may be more suitable, though both are acceptable.\nThe term \"WMC\" is used in the fourth and fifth translations, which is the most abbreviated form from the dictionary. While it is valid, it may not be as clear to a general audience unfamiliar with the acronym. \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" is the most descriptive and informative option, and it is used in the first, second, third, and sixth translations.\nThe adjectives used to describe the tone of the short film—\"witty and humorous,\" \"humorous and engaging,\" \"humorous and witty\"—are all appropriate, though \"humorous and witty\" is slightly more redundant than \"humorous and engaging.\" The latter offers a more varied and natural expression.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"short film,\" the full term \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" and the most natural adjectives to describe the tone. A refined version would be: \"The short film introduces 'Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect' in a humorous and engaging manner.\"\nThe final translation is:\nThe short film introduces \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" in a humorous and engaging manner.\n\n# Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with multiple relevant institutions to host the \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship.\" Entering its 10th anniversary in 2024, the event's theme is \"Next-gen Finance,\" aiming to introduce secondary students to innovations such as fintech, artificial intelligence, and other developments and future trends, as well as promote students' commitment to sustainable development and environmental, social, and governance principles.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency in terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Design Thinking Challenge,\" \"GBA Invitation Match,\" and \"Young Financial Talent Runway.\"\n- The structure of the original text is preserved in all translations, maintaining the logical flow of information.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Championship Match,\" \"Championship Battle,\" and \"Competition\"** are used interchangeably, which may confuse the reader. The original text uses the term \"爭霸戰,\" which is best translated as \"Championship\" or \"Competition\" without additional descriptors like \"Match\" or \"Battle.\"\n- **\"125,000 times\"** is used in some translations, which is misleading. The original text refers to the number of participations, not the number of times the event was held. The correct phrasing should be \"approximately 125,000 participations\" or \"approximately 125,000 students participated.\"\n- **\"Financial literacy\"** and **\"financial knowledge\"** are used in different translations. While both are acceptable, \"financial knowledge\" is more consistent with the original text's emphasis on testing students' understanding of financial topics.\n- **\"Mentor-mentee format\"** and **\"mentorship format\"** are both acceptable, but \"mentorship format\" is more commonly used in educational contexts.\n- Some translations use **\"the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao region\"** while others use **\"the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\"** The latter is more precise and aligns with the term \"大灣區\" in the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use **\"Championship\"** consistently for \"爭霸戰.\"\n- Replace **\"125,000 times\"** with **\"approximately 125,000 participations\"** or **\"approximately 125,000 students participated.\"**\n- Use **\"financial knowledge\"** for consistency.\n- Use **\"the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\"** for accuracy.\n- Ensure **\"mentorship format\"** is used consistently.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe first part of the Championship is an online quiz competition, testing students' financial knowledge and understanding of current financial topics. In 2024, a total of 32,000 students from 290 secondary schools participated in the online quiz, setting a new record. Between 2015 and 2024, approximately 125,000 students from 440 secondary schools participated in the online quiz segment of the Championship. The second part of the Championship, the \"Young Financial Talent Runway,\" is conducted in a mentorship format, with experienced professionals from various fields serving as mentors to train students to prepare for the \"Design Thinking Challenge.\" In 2024, this part of the Championship also specially added the \"GBA Invitation Match\" to promote interaction and exchange among students from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nVice President Chen Weimin delivered a welcome speech at the championship final and encouraged the participants.\n\nStudents participating in the Young Financial Talent Runway meet with their mentors.\n\n# Educational Tabletop Games\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses the correct term \"fintech\" and includes all key elements. However, the phrase \"raise awareness of this original board game among more people\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"fintech\" and includes all key points. However, it lacks the phrase \"allowing more people to become familiar with this original board game,\" which is present in the original text.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"fintech innovation\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is not the most appropriate choice in this context. It also uses \"online security\" instead of \"cybersecurity,\" which is less precise. The phrase \"aiming to raise awareness\" is slightly less direct than \"to raise awareness.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"fintech\" and \"cybersecurity\" appropriately. However, it uses \"introduce more people to this original board game,\" which is slightly less direct than \"allowing more people to become familiar with this original board game.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"fintech innovation\" and \"cybersecurity\" appropriately. However, it is slightly wordy and uses \"enabling primary school students to learn about... in simulated scenarios,\" which is slightly less direct than \"through simulated scenarios.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"fintech\" and \"cybersecurity\" appropriately. However, it uses \"among the public\" instead of \"among more people,\" which is slightly less direct than the original.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the original intent of the text, which is to raise awareness of the board game and enhance its use as an educational tool for primary school students.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strengths of the various translations, using the most appropriate terms from the dictionary and maintaining the original intent and tone of the text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game, \"$smart Money Management 321,\" in 2023 and continued to promote it in 2024, allowing more people to become familiar with this original board game and strengthening its use as an educational tool. The game enables primary school students to learn about different payment methods, basic financial concepts, fintech, and cybersecurity through simulated scenarios.\n\nAt the community level, we set up a booth at the \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024\" and held workshops in the community during Christmas and Lunar New Year, as well as parent-child workshops at the HKMA office, to further promote financial and money management concepts. In addition, we arranged in-school activities for primary students to try out the board games and conducted train-the-trainer workshops to encourage secondary school teachers to use board games as one of the teaching materials in the financial education module of the newly introduced junior secondary subject \"Citizenship, Economics and Society.\" The board games have been recognized by the Education Bureau as one of the outstanding teaching tools and were used as prizes for winning schools in its \"Financial Education School Award Scheme\" (2023\/24). In 2024, the HKMA held a total of approximately 40 board game workshops, attracting participation from over 3,600 students, parents, teachers, and social workers.\n\nBased on the provided translations, several observations can be made regarding translation quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"香港書展\" as \"Hong Kong Book Fair,\" \"綠色金融\" as \"green financing,\" \"$mart理財321\" as \"$smart Money Management 321,\" and \"金管局\" as \"HKMA.\" However, there are variations in phrasing and grammatical structure that affect fluency and clarity.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations are very similar in structure and content, with minor differences in prepositions and verb tenses. The third and fifth translations differ slightly in the use of \"Corporate Greening Transformation\" versus \"Corporate Green Transformation\" and in the phrasing of the distribution of the game.\nThe phrase \"Corporate Green Transformation\" appears to be the most consistent and natural choice among the translations, as \"greening\" may imply a process rather than a specific transformation. Additionally, the use of \"given away as a souvenir\" or \"distributed as a souvenir\" is more natural than \"given out as a souvenir.\"\nThe fifth translation stands out for its use of \"being given away as a souvenir at its booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2024,\" which is more precise and natural in English. It also uses \"designed to impart knowledge of green financing to students,\" which is slightly more formal and precise than \"convey knowledge about green financing to students.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing, correct grammar, and precise vocabulary, ensuring clarity and fluency in English while adhering to the dictionary terms.\nThe final translation should use \"Corporate Green Transformation\" as the game's title, \"given away as a souvenir\" to describe its distribution, and \"designed to impart knowledge of green financing to students\" to convey the purpose of the game.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is as follows:\nBuilding on the experience of developing the \"$smart Money Management 321\" board game, the HKMA launched the strategy board game \"Corporate Green Transformation,\" which is being given away as a souvenir at its booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2024. This is the first board game in Hong Kong designed to impart knowledge of green financing to students.\n\nIn addition, we continue to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council to enhance the financial knowledge and wealth management capabilities of Hong Kong residents, and we will explore further collaboration with various stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community participation initiatives.\n\nThrough board game activities, promote financial literacy to teachers, students, and parents.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. Furthermore, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of budget and expenditure data in its Annual Report (see the section “Budget Preparation and Financial Control” on pages 193 to 194).\n"}

使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除特別註明外，所有金額均以港幣百萬元位列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n","terms":{"$mart理財321":["$mart

done a good job of translating the required terms using the dictionary. However, there are some nuances in phrasing that can be refined for greater fluency and formality.\n\"Director of Audit Report\" and \"Director of Audit's Report\" are both grammatically correct, but \"Director of Audit's Report\" is more natural and commonly used in formal contexts. \"Report by the Director of Audit\" is also correct but slightly less direct.\nFor the second item, \"Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\" is grammatically correct and clear, but \"Exchange Fund Financial Statements\" is more concise and commonly used in official documents. It also aligns better with the structure of the first item, maintaining parallelism.\nTaking these considerations into account, the most natural and formal translation would be:\nDirector of Audit's Report  \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Director of Audit's Report\n\n# The Audit Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is \"# 香港特別行政區政府審計署\". The key term here is \"審計署\", which is not in the provided dictionary. However, the dictionary does include \"香港特別行政區政府\" as a key, which must be translated as \"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\".\nThe junior translators have attempted to translate the full title, but with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n1. **First junior translator:** \"# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Audit Office\" – This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly places \"Audit Office\" after the government entity, which is the standard format for such titles in English.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Planning Department\" – This is incorrect because \"Planning Department\" does not match \"審計署\" (Audit Office).\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" – This is also incorrect. \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" does not correspond to \"審計署\".\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"# Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\" – This is a close translation, but \"Audit Commission\" is not the standard term used in Hong Kong for \"審計署\". The correct term is \"Audit Office\".\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Planning and Development Bureau\" – This is incorrect, as \"Planning and Development Bureau\" does not match \"審計署\".\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Audit Department\" – This is close, but \"Audit Department\" is not the standard term used in Hong Kong for \"審計署\". The correct term is \"Audit Office\".\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should use the exact term \"Audit Office\" as it is the standard term used in Hong Kong for \"審計署\". The structure should follow the format used in official titles, placing the office name after the government entity. Therefore, the most accurate and fluent translation is: \"# The Audit Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\".\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") set out on pages 209 to 309, which include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, and the income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the HKFRS Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and have truly and fairly reflected the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2024, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a thorough review of the six translations provided. All translations accurately incorporate the required dictionary terms: \"《外匯基金條例》\" as \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"審計署的審計準則\" as \"Audit Commission auditing standards,\" and \"財務報表\" as \"financial statements.\" This is a strong point across all translations.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are largely correct, though there are minor variations in phrasing and structure. The first, second, third, fourth, and sixth translations use \"I have conducted the audit\" or \"I have conducted the audit,\" which is consistent and natural. The fifth translation uses \"I have performed the audit,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less common in formal audit reports.\nThe phrasing of the section title \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of the Financial Statements\" appears in multiple variations across the translations. While all are grammatically correct, the most concise and commonly used phrasing is \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of the Financial Statements,\" as seen in the first, fourth, and fifth translations.\nThe use of \"the Group\" versus \"the group\" is a minor stylistic choice. In formal reports, \"the Group\" is often capitalized when referring to a specific entity, so this is a matter of style rather than correctness.\nThe phrase \"sufficient and appropriate\" is used consistently across translations, which is accurate and appropriate in the context of audit evidence.\nThe fifth translation includes an additional sentence: \"My responsibilities under those standards, as detailed in the 'Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial statements' section of this report, are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.\" While this sentence is factually accurate and adds clarity, it introduces information not present in the original Chinese text. Therefore, it should be omitted to ensure fidelity to the source.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the accurate use of dictionary terms, maintain a formal and professional tone, and use the most concise and commonly accepted phrasing for the section title. It should also avoid adding information not present in the original text.\nImproved Translation:\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities in accordance with those standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. I addressed these matters in the audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nThe original title, \"# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值,\" translates to \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\" or similar variations. The junior translators have produced several versions that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and capitalization that affect the fluency and professionalism of the translation.\nThe first and fourth translations are nearly identical and use \"measured at fair value,\" which is a standard term in financial reporting. However, \"measured\" may not be the most natural choice in this context. The third and fifth translations use \"carried at fair value\" and \"accounted for at fair value,\" respectively. \"Carried at fair value\" is more commonly used in accounting terminology to describe how assets and liabilities are presented on the balance sheet. \"Accounted for at fair value\" is also acceptable but slightly less common.\nThe second and sixth translations capitalize all major words, which is appropriate for a title but may be overly formal for some contexts. The use of a hashtag (#) in the sixth translation is unnecessary and should be omitted.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"carried at fair value\" as it is the most natural and commonly used term in financial accounting. It also maintains a professional tone without being overly formal. The title should not include a hashtag, and the capitalization should follow standard title case conventions.\nTherefore, the improved translation is: \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value.\"\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 37.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 391.5117 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 138.6299 billion.\n\nThe original sentence discusses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities, specifying that 86% of financial assets and all financial liabilities are measured using either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and grammatical correctness.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, using \"measured at fair value based on quoted prices\" which is natural in financial contexts. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains the structure of the original sentence.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate and fluent, with a slightly different structure that reads smoothly. It uses \"valued at quoted prices\" and \"parameters used are based on observable market data,\" which are appropriate.\n**Translation 3** has a minor grammatical issue: \"the fair value is based on quoted prices\" is awkwardly phrased, as it implies that the fair value itself is based on the prices, rather than the measurement of the fair value. It also omits \"such\" before \"financial assets,\" which is present in the original.\n**Translation 4** is the most accurate in terms of capturing the original meaning, particularly with \"quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,\" which closely mirrors the original's \"相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價.\" However, it uses \"is based on\" twice, which may be redundant.\n**Translation 5** is overly repetitive with \"the fair values of these financial assets and all the fair values of these financial liabilities,\" which is unnecessarily wordy and less fluent.\n**Translation 6** is very close to the best version, with a clear structure and correct use of terms. It is slightly more concise than Translation 4 and avoids redundancy.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"measured at fair value\" or \"valued at fair value\" to reflect the standard financial terminology.\n- Ensure that \"quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\" is included to accurately reflect the original.\n- Avoid redundancy in the use of \"based on\" and ensure that the sentence flows naturally.\n- Maintain the use of \"such\" where appropriate to reflect the original's reference to previously mentioned financial assets and liabilities.\n**Improved Translation:**\n86% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 14% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).

The dictionary specifies that \"監控措施\" must be translated as \"control measures,\" which is a direct and accurate translation.\n**Translation Analysis:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including control measures related to applications in computer systems;\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"control measures\" for \"監控措施\" and maintains the structure of the original sentence.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The repetition of \"control measures\" may be slightly redundant, but it is grammatically correct and clear.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including related application monitoring measures for computer systems;\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"monitoring measures\" instead of \"control measures\" for the second instance, which is not in the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly uses \"monitoring measures\" instead of \"control measures\" for the second instance, violating the dictionary requirement.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including control measures related to computer system applications.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"control measures\" and maintains clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less precise in specifying the relationship between applications and computer systems.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including control measures related to applications for the computer system;\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"control measures.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"for the computer system\" is slightly awkward compared to \"in computer systems.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including monitoring measures related to applications on computer systems;\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly uses \"monitoring measures\" instead of \"control measures\" for the second instance, violating the dictionary requirement.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"Evaluate and test control measures, including application control measures related to computer systems;\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"control measures\" and a slightly more natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"application control measures\" may be slightly ambiguous compared to \"control measures related to applications.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nEvaluate and test control measures, including control measures related to applications in computer systems.\n\nObtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nIf market quotations are used, verify the prices against independent sources.\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation techniques are based on observable market data, assess whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"valuation techniques\" for \"估值方法\" and \"observable market data\" for \"可觀察市場數據.\" This is a strong point, as adherence to the dictionary is critical in this task.\nThe first, second, third, fifth, and fourth translations are very similar, with slight variations in verb choice (e.g., \"assess\" vs. \"evaluate\" vs. \"verify\") and phrasing (e.g., \"based on independent sources\" vs. \"using independent sources\"). These differences are stylistic and do not affect the meaning significantly. However, \"assess\" and \"evaluate\" are both appropriate and commonly used in formal contexts, while \"verify\" is more precise in the context of checking or confirming parameters.\nThe sixth translation uses \"verifying\" twice, which changes the grammatical structure from imperative to gerund form, making the sentence less direct and slightly less formal. This is a minor but notable deviation from the others.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct and natural in English. However, the most consistent and formal phrasing is found in the first, third, and fifth translations, which use \"assess whether\" and \"verify the parameters based on independent sources.\"\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain clarity, formality, and precision. The use of \"assess whether\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"evaluate whether,\" and \"verify the parameters based on independent sources\" is more direct and commonly used in regulatory or financial contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIf the parameters used in the valuation techniques are based on observable market data, assess whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation techniques are not based on observable market data, assess whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\nThe original Chinese sentence is a conditional statement that outlines a process for evaluating valuation techniques when their parameters are not based on observable market data. The sentence structure is formal and technical, which is reflected in the translations provided.\nAll six translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"valuation techniques\" for \"估值方法\" and \"observable market data\" for \"可觀察市場數據.\" This is a strength across all translations.\nThe first junior translator uses \"assess\" and \"reasonableness,\" which are appropriate and formal. The second uses \"evaluate\" and \"reasonable,\" which are also suitable. The third translation is grammatically incomplete, as it lacks a verb after \"whether,\" making it a fragment. The fourth and fifth translations are nearly identical to the second and first, respectively, with only minor differences in punctuation and word choice. The sixth translation uses \"valuation method\" instead of \"valuation techniques,\" which is a deviation from the dictionary and less precise in a technical context.\nThe best translations are the first, second, fourth, and fifth, as they are grammatically correct, use appropriate vocabulary, and maintain the formal tone of the original. The third translation is incomplete and should be avoided. The sixth translation is slightly less accurate due to the use of \"valuation method\" instead of \"valuation techniques.\"\nThe most improved translation would use \"assess\" or \"evaluate\" as the main verb, include \"related\" before \"assumptions and parameters,\" and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also avoid any grammatical fragments or deviations from the dictionary terms.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese title, \"# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值,\" is a heading or subheading likely used in a financial or accounting document. The key term here is \"公平值,\" which is explicitly defined in the dictionary as \"fair value.\" All translations correctly use \"fair value\" for this term, which is appropriate.\nAmong the junior translators' versions, several are very similar. The first translation, \"Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value,\" is grammatically correct and fluent, but \"measured at fair value\" is slightly less common in accounting terminology than \"carried at fair value.\" The second translation, \"# Valuation of Investment Properties Recorded at Fair Value,\" uses \"recorded,\" which is not the standard term in accounting for how assets are valued on the balance sheet. The third translation, \"Valuation of Investment Property Accounted for at Fair Value,\" uses \"accounted for,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"carried at fair value.\" The fourth translation, \"The investment property, accounted for at fair value, is being valued,\" is a full sentence and not suitable as a heading. The fifth translation, \"Valuation of Investment Property Accounted for at Fair Value,\" is similar to the third but uses \"Property\" singular, which may not match the plural \"物業\" in the original. The sixth translation, \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value,\" is the most accurate and natural, using \"carried at fair value,\" which is the standard accounting term for how assets are valued on the balance sheet.\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard accounting terminology. \"Carried at fair value\" is the most appropriate phrase in this context, as it reflects the standard accounting treatment of investment properties. Therefore, the most suitable translation is \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value.\"\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"carried at fair value\" and \"HK$21.132 billion\" appropriately. The term \"valuation techniques\" is correctly used for \"估值方法\" and \"fair value\" for \"公平值.\" The structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has a minor error in the amount: \"HKD 211.32 billion\" instead of \"21.132 billion.\" Also, the phrase \"valuation techniques\" is incorrectly used as \"independent professional valuation techniques\" instead of \"independent professional valuers.\" This is a critical error in terminology.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKD 21.132 billion\" correctly and \"valuation techniques\" appropriately. The structure is clear and professional.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"HKD 211.32 billion\" correctly and \"valuation techniques\" appropriately. The phrase \"associated companies\" is used instead of \"associates,\" which is acceptable but slightly less standard in financial contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKD 21.132 billion\" correctly and \"valuation techniques\" appropriately. The structure is clear and professional.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"HKD 21.132 billion\" correctly and \"valuation techniques\" appropriately. The phrase \"fair values\" is plural, which is slightly different from the original, but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The amount \"211.32億港元\" should be \"HK$21.132 billion\" (not \"211.32 billion\").\n- The term \"valuation techniques\" should be used for \"估值方法\" and \"fair value\" for \"公平值.\"\n- The phrase \"independent professional valuers\" is more standard than \"independent professional valuation techniques.\"\n- The use of \"associates\" and \"joint ventures\" is standard in financial contexts.\n- The structure should be clear and professional, avoiding unnecessary repetition.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value, totaling HK$21.132 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also holds interests in associates and joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, is primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：**\nThe key term **公平值** must be translated as **fair value**, as specified in the dictionary.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value, the audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is a standard accounting term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Regarding\" is slightly informal for a professional audit context. \"Measured at fair value\" is accurate but could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted at fair value,\" which is a common phrase in financial reporting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Accounted at fair value\" is slightly awkward; \"accounted for at fair value\" is more standard.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is grammatically correct and standard.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Regarding\" is less formal than \"The audit procedures for...\" in a professional context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is standard.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"the valuation of investment properties\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for investment property accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and uses \"accounted for at fair value.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Investment property\" is singular, which may not match the original plural \"投資物業.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, the audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value\" and maintains the plural form \"investment properties.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Regarding\" is less formal than \"The audit procedures for...\" in a professional context.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use **\"accounted for at fair value\"** as it is the standard and grammatically correct phrase in financial contexts.\n- Use **\"investment properties\"** to match the original plural form.\n- Use a formal and professional structure, such as **\"The audit procedures for...\"** rather than **\"Regarding...\"** for clarity and tone.\n### Final Translation:\n**The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:**\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by joint ventures or associate companies, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports.\n\nAssess the independence and qualifications of the appraiser; and\n\nEvaluate whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This other information includes all the information in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for 2024, but excludes the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I do not express any form of attestation conclusion regarding other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information and consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original text is a formal statement about the responsibilities of two bodies—the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee—regarding financial statements. The key to a strong translation lies in clarity, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee bear responsibilities regarding the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, clear structure, and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Bear responsibilities\" is slightly awkward; \"have responsibility\" or \"are responsible for\" would be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"Responsibility of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses correct terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks a subject and verb, making it a fragment. It reads more like a title than a complete sentence.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's responsibilities regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses correct terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Awkward structure; the possessive form \"Committee's\" is misplaced and creates confusion.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and uses proper terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Misplaces the Monetary Authority as being above the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which is not accurate based on the original text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s responsibilities regarding the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The possessive form \"Committee’s\" is misplaced, leading to ambiguity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Monetary Authority regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and uses proper terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Suggests the Monetary Authority is on the same level as the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which may not be accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should clearly state that the **Monetary Authority** and the **Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee** are responsible for the **financial statements**. It should avoid possessive confusion, maintain grammatical correctness, and reflect the hierarchical relationship implied in the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee are responsible for the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Monetary Authority,\" \"HKFRS Accounting Standards,\" \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" and \"financial statements.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"material misstatements\" and \"fraud or error\" is accurate and appropriate in a financial context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Voice:** Some translations use \"must be responsible for\" or \"must prepare,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more rigid than the original's more neutral tone. The original uses \"須負責\" which is more about a duty or responsibility rather than a strict obligation.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"the Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily, which can make the sentences feel wordy.\n- **Word Choice:** The use of \"promulgated\" in translations 5 and 6 is slightly more formal than \"issued\" or \"颁佈\" in the original, which may be acceptable but is not the most direct translation.\n- **Fluency:** Some translations use \"and for implementing\" or \"and implementing,\" which can disrupt the flow of the sentence. A smoother transition is possible.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use of \"is responsible for\" (as in translations 1 and 6) is more natural and aligns better with the tone of the original.\n- Avoiding repetition of \"the Monetary Authority\" by using \"it\" or rephrasing the sentence can improve fluency.\n- Using \"issued\" instead of \"promulgated\" is more consistent with the original term \"頒布.\"\n- Ensuring that the sentence structure is concise and flows naturally in English without sacrificing accuracy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the HKFRS Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls as it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters relating to the going concern where applicable, and for using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting an official or institutional context. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in prepositions, verb choice, and capitalization that affect fluency and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" is translated as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"審核委員會\" as \"Audit Sub-Committee.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, with the subject being \"The Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" or \"of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n- The verb \"oversee\" is used in most translations, which is appropriate for a formal context. One translation uses \"supervise,\" which is slightly less formal and less commonly used in official contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"under\" versus \"of\" is a matter of style. \"Under\" implies a hierarchical relationship, while \"of\" is more neutral. In formal institutional contexts, \"of\" is often preferred.\n- The use of \"Group’s\" with a capital \"G\" is inconsistent. In most translations, it is lowercase, which is more natural unless \"Group\" is a proper noun.\n- The word \"supervising\" in one translation is less formal and less precise than \"overseeing\" in the others.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"of\" instead of \"under\" for a more formal and standard institutional phrasing.\n- Ensure \"Group’s\" is lowercase unless it is a proper noun.\n- Use \"overseeing\" as the preferred verb in formal contexts.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor's Responsibility in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use \"Audit Commission\" as specified in the dictionary. The primary variations lie in the choice of prepositions (\"in accordance with\" vs. \"according to\"), the use of \"audit standards\" vs. \"auditing guidelines,\" and the verbs used to describe the application of professional judgment (\"apply\" vs. \"exercise\"). \nWhile all translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, the most natural and commonly used phrasing in professional contexts is \"in accordance with\" and \"audit standards.\" The use of \"apply professional judgment\" is also more standard in audit-related texts than \"exercise professional judgment.\" The phrase \"During the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards\" is concise, clear, and professionally appropriate.\nBased on these considerations, the translation provided by the second junior translator is the most suitable as a base, with minor adjustments to ensure consistency and fluency.\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements caused by fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect material misstatements caused by error.\n\nUnderstand internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls.\n\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n\nDetermine whether the Monetary Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainties exist, it is necessary for the auditor's report to draw users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may result in the group being unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and\n\n-Plan and execute group audits to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business units within the group, serving as the basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and reviewing the audit work performed in connection with the group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identified during the audit.\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the current period, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless disclosure of a matter is prohibited by law or regulation, or in extremely rare circumstances, where the adverse consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest, in which case I will decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\nThe original title \"# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\" is a heading for a document that provides additional information related to the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The key terms \"外匯基金\" and \"財務報表\" must be translated exactly as specified in the dictionary: \"Exchange Fund\" and \"financial statements,\" respectively.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation 1**: \"# Exchange Fund - Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Financial Statements\" as per the dictionary. The use of a hash (#) matches the original formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The dash between \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Notes to the Financial Statements\" is inconsistent with the original's use of an en dash (–).  \n2. **Translation 2**: \"Exchange Fund – Notes to the financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the en dash (–) and the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"financial statements\" is lowercase, which may be less formal than the title case used in the original.  \n3. **Translation 3**: \"Exchange Fund – Financial Statements Notes\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the en dash (–) and the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"Financial Statements Notes\" is not the standard phrasing; the more common and formal term is \"Notes to the Financial Statements.\"  \n4. **Translation 4**: \"# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Matches the original formatting with the hash (#) and en dash (–). Uses the correct dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None.

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate in meaning. However, it misrepresents the source by stating that the Monetary Authority manages the Fund \"in its capacity as manager of the Fund,\" which is redundant and slightly unclear. Also, \"Cap. 66\" is used without the full name \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which may be less clear to some readers.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Cap. 66\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" and accurately reflects the source's structure. However, it uses \"principal function\" instead of \"main business\" or \"primary objectives,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66)\" and \"main functions.\" However, it uses \"Governor\" for \"manager,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be misleading.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate in meaning. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66)\" and \"monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong.\" However, it uses \"Governor\" instead of \"manager,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be misleading.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66)\" and \"main functions.\" It also avoids the use of \"Governor\" and sticks to the dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"under the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary as the Fund's manager\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66)\" and \"monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong.\" It also avoids the use of \"Governor\" and sticks to the dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"under the powers granted by the Financial Secretary in the capacity of Fund Manager of the Exchange Fund (Fund)\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66),\" and \"monetary and financial systems.\"\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Avoid using terms not in the dictionary, such as \"Governor.\"\n- Use clear and concise phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fifth and sixth translations, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority manages the Exchange Fund (the Fund) under the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the Fund's manager, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The Fund's main functions are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in style, terminology, and precision. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and concise. It uses \"fully aligned with the Monetary Base,\" which is appropriate. However, it omits the acronym \"IP\" for \"Investment Portfolio,\" which could be useful in a formal document. The phrase \"included in the fund's accounts\" is slightly less formal than \"recorded in the fund's accounts.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, but it includes the full name \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" in parentheses after \"HKSAR Government,\" which is redundant since the dictionary already defines \"HKSAR Government\" as the full name. It also uses \"has been included,\" which is slightly more passive than necessary.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"fully backed by the Monetary Base,\" which is slightly different from the original's \"完全相配\" (fully matched). It also uses \"included in the fund’s accounts\" and omits the acronym \"IP.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses \"fully match the Monetary Base,\" which is slightly more direct than \"fully aligned with\" or \"fully backed by.\" It also uses \"are accounted for in the fund's books,\" which is slightly more formal and precise. However, it uses \"Information about the operating segments\" instead of \"Operating segment data,\" which is less concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and uses \"fully matched with the Monetary Base,\" which is appropriate. It also uses \"debt and equity markets\" instead of \"bond and equity markets,\" which is slightly more precise. It includes \"Segmental information is set out in note 31,\" which is a common financial term.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the fifth, but it uses \"fully matched to the monetary base\" (lowercase), which is less formal than the dictionary's \"Monetary Base\" (title case). It also uses \"shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\" which is slightly less precise than \"shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"Monetary Base\" should be capitalized as it is a specific financial term.\n- \"Fully matched\" is more precise than \"fully aligned\" or \"fully backed.\"\n- The acronym \"IP\" for \"Investment Portfolio\" should be included for clarity in a formal document.\n- \"Shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" is more precise than \"shares in.\"\n- \"Recorded in the fund's accounts\" is more formal and precise than \"included in the fund's accounts.\"\n- \"Operating segment data\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts than \"Information about the operating segments.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe fund's assets are managed across four distinct portfolios: Backing Portfolio (BP), Investment Portfolio (IP), Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP), and Strategic Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's Currency Board system, the assets of the Backing Portfolio are fully matched to the Monetary Base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets of OECD member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the HKSAR Government for strategic purposes and are recorded in the fund's accounts. Operating segment data is presented in Note 31.\n"}
