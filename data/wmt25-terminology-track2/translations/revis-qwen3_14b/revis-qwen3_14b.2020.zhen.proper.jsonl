{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. The use of \"caught everyone off guard\" is natural, and \"gross domestic product\" is correctly used. However, \"economic activities in many parts of the world\" is slightly less concise than \"economic activity worldwide.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very fluent and uses \"taking everyone by surprise\" effectively. The phrase \"on record\" is more concise than \"in recorded history.\" The use of \"suffering particularly severe damage\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"wreaked havoc\" is more dramatic than necessary, and \"bringing economic activities to a near standstill worldwide\" is slightly wordy. The phrase \"suffering particularly severe blows\" is a bit overused and less natural than alternatives.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation with natural phrasing. \"Economic activity around the world nearly came to a standstill\" is concise and clear. The use of \"GDP\" is appropriate, and \"particularly hard hit\" is a natural expression.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is very fluent and uses \"ravaged the world\" effectively. The phrase \"with its gross domestic product (GDP)\" is slightly redundant, as \"GDP\" is already defined. However, the overall tone is natural and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is a solid translation with natural phrasing. The use of \"nearly coming to a standstill\" is slightly less direct than \"nearly came to a standstill.\" The phrase \"particularly hit hard\" is acceptable but slightly less idiomatic than \"particularly hard hit.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and grammatically precise. It should use \"GDP\" where appropriate, avoid redundancy, and maintain a neutral yet clear tone. Based on the above analysis, the fourth and sixth translations are the strongest, with the fourth being slightly more concise and natural in phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, catching everyone off guard, and economic activity around the world nearly came to a standstill. Under the impact of the pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted for the second consecutive year following 2019, with its GDP recording the largest drop on record. The unemployment rate soared to a 16-year high, with some industries particularly hard hit.\n\nHowever, the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use \"monetary and banking systems\" for \"貨幣及銀行體系\" as required by the dictionary. The main variations lie in the choice of words for \"困境\" (adversity, difficulties, challenges), \"展現我們實力的時候\" (when we demonstrate our strength), and \"審慎政策\" (prudent policies, cautious policies).\nThe first translation uses \"adversity is often when we demonstrate our strength,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. The second and third translations use \"difficulties\" and \"opportunities to demonstrate our strength,\" which are more natural. The fourth and sixth translations use \"adversity often reveals our true strength,\" which is more idiomatic and impactful. The fifth translation uses \"challenges are often opportunities to demonstrate our strength,\" which is also natural but slightly more passive in tone.\nThe phrase \"successfully withstood the impact\" is used in several translations, while \"successfully withstood the shocks\" appears in the third and fifth translations. \"Shocks\" may be more appropriate in the context of economic or financial crises, but \"impact\" is also acceptable.\nThe phrase \"This is by no means accidental\" is used in the first and second translations, while \"This is no coincidence\" appears in the fourth and fifth translations. Both are correct, but \"This is no coincidence\" is more concise and commonly used in formal writing.\nThe phrase \"long-term adherence to prudent policies\" is used in the second translation, while \"long-standing commitment to prudent policies\" appears in the third and fourth translations. Both are correct, but \"long-standing commitment\" may be more appropriate in the context of sustained policy implementation.\nThe phrase \"consistent adherence to prudent policies over the years\" is used in the first and sixth translations, which is slightly more wordy than necessary.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"adversity often reveals our true strength,\" \"successfully withstood the shocks,\" and \"long-standing commitment to prudent policies\" for a natural, fluent, and impactful result.\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems have once again successfully withstood the shocks. This is no coincidence, but rather the result of our long-standing commitment to prudent policies.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original Chinese text, which is that the path to economic recovery is uncertain due to a variety of factors, including monetary policy, vaccination progress, and geopolitical tensions. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"central banks,\" \"monetary policy,\" and \"geopolitical tensions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"uncertain,\" \"variables,\" and \"macroeconomic outlook\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"prolonged low-interest-rate environment\" and \"macroeconomic situation,\" which are slightly less idiomatic than alternatives.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"low-interest environments\" instead of \"low-interest-rate environment,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"low interest rates\" instead of \"low-interest-rate environment,\" which is more general and less precise.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal, using \"prolonged low-interest-rate environment\" and \"macroeconomic landscape,\" which are both natural and precise.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"long-term low-interest environments,\" which is slightly awkward and less precise than \"prolonged low-interest-rate environment.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"fraught with uncertainty\" and \"ever-changing geopolitical tensions,\" which are more vivid and idiomatic than some of the other translations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use of \"prolonged low-interest-rate environment\" is more precise than \"low-interest environments\" or \"low interest rates.\"\n- \"Macroeconomic landscape\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"macroeconomic situation\" or \"macroeconomic outlook.\"\n- \"Ever-changing geopolitical tensions\" is more vivid and natural than \"constantly changing\" or \"continuously changes.\"\n- \"Fraught with uncertainty\" is a more idiomatic expression than \"full of uncertainty\" or \"remains uncertain.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe best possible translation would combine the most natural and precise phrasing from the best elements of the junior translations, ensuring fluency, accuracy, and idiomatic expression in English.\n---\nThe path to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Even as central banks and governments worldwide are fully supporting the economy, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty, including the stance of central banks on monetary policy, the progress of vaccination programs, and the potential impact of prolonged low-interest-rate environments. On the other hand, the ever-changing geopolitical tensions add further uncertainty to the macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDespite the uncertain situation, the HKMA will remain steadfast in maintaining monetary and financial stability, creating a favorable environment for economic recovery. At the same time, in the ever-evolving banking and financial sector landscape, we will also strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Stability: As Steady as Ever\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use \"LERS\" and \"strong-side Convertibility Undertaking\" as specified in the dictionary, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and accuracy in financial terminology.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and fluent English structure.\n- Proper handling of the key financial concepts, such as the stability of the Hong Kong dollar and the role of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- **\"Smoothly and orderly\"** is repeated in all translations. While grammatically correct, it is somewhat redundant. A more natural phrasing such as \"smoothly and efficiently\" or \"smoothly and effectively\" might be more idiomatic.\n- **\"Cumulative funds inflow\"** is used in some translations. While understandable, \"cumulative capital inflows\" or \"cumulative inflows\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **\"HKD 3,835 billion\"** in the fourth translation is incorrect. The original text states \"3,835億港元,\" which is **383.5 billion Hong Kong dollars**, not 3,835 billion. This is a critical numerical error that must be corrected.\n- **\"Weathered crisis after crisis\"** in the fourth translation is slightly more dramatic than the original, which uses \"渡過一次又一次的難關\" — a more neutral and measured expression. \"Weathered one challenge after another\" or \"weathered numerous challenges\" is more appropriate.\n- **\"Fluctuating macroeconomic environment\"** is used in some translations. While correct, \"volatile macroeconomic environment\" is more commonly used in financial reporting and may be more appropriate.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would:\n- Use \"LERS\" consistently.\n- Use \"strong-side Convertibility Undertaking\" as specified.\n- Avoid redundancy in expressions like \"smoothly and orderly.\"\n- Correct the numerical error in the fourth translation.\n- Use more idiomatic and commonly used financial terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and efficiently in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the LERS has weathered one challenge after another, fully demonstrating its ability to withstand shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 85 times, with cumulative capital inflows of approximately HK$383.5 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"LERS,\" \"HKMA,\" \"IMF,\" and \"External Sector Report 2020.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and regulatory terminology, such as \"sound financial regulation and supervision\" and \"prudent fiscal framework.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"operation rules\" instead of \"operational rules,\" which is slightly less standard in formal contexts.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"monitoring capabilities\" instead of \"supervisory capabilities,\" which is less precise in the context of financial regulation.\n- **Translation 3** has a slightly awkward phrasing in \"effectively communicated with the public through close collaboration with the industry,\" which could be smoother.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"flexible economic policies\" instead of \"flexible economy,\" which is a minor deviation from the original.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"facts and figures\" instead of \"facts and data,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"monitoring capabilities\" again, and \"facts and figures\" as well, which are less precise than \"supervisory capabilities\" and \"facts and data.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"supervisory capabilities\" is more precise in the context of financial regulation than \"monitoring capabilities.\"\n- \"Operational rules\" is more standard than \"operation rules.\"\n- \"Flexible economy\" is more aligned with the original than \"flexible economic policies.\"\n- \"Facts and data\" is more precise than \"facts and figures.\"\n- The phrase \"swiftly dispelling rumors and timely providing the latest information on facts and data\" should be rephrased for better flow and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would integrate the most accurate terminology, maintain fluency, and ensure clarity and precision in conveying the original message.\nThe LERS has remained stable thanks to the solid foundation built over the years. As summarized by the International Monetary Fund in its \"External Sector Report 2020,\" the credibility of the LERS is built on transparent operational rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework. At the same time, the HKMA has swiftly dispelled rumors and provided the public with the latest facts and data through close engagement with the industry and effective communication via traditional and social media. The HKMA also leverages the latest technology and data analysis techniques to continuously enhance its supervisory capabilities, enabling it to flexibly respond to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic placed significant pressure on the economy, the banking sector remained stable with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.7%, well above the international statutory minimum requirement of 8%. The average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, the asset quality of banks deteriorated slightly, with the classified loan ratio rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020, but remained sound and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking Sector: The Lifeblood of the Economy\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and numerical accuracy that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer,\" \"regulatory reserve requirement,\" \"banking sector,\" and \"credit and liquidity risk management.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n- The use of terms like \"lending capacity,\" \"lending space,\" and \"lending support\" is appropriate in the context of banking regulation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical accuracy:** The fourth and fifth translations incorrectly state \"HKD 100 billion\" instead of \"HKD 1 trillion\" as in the original. This is a critical error that changes the meaning significantly.\n- **Fluency and word choice:** Some translations use phrases like \"supervising credit and liquidity risk management\" (third and sixth translations), which is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"monitoring credit and liquidity risk management.\"\n- **Redundancy and clarity:** The fifth translation uses \"closely regulating banks' credit and liquidity risk management,\" which is redundant and less precise than \"focusing on credit and liquidity risk management.\"\n- **Consistency in currency notation:** Some translations use \"HKD\" while others use \"HK$.\" It is more standard in financial contexts to use \"HK$\" for clarity and consistency.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"HK$\" for currency, maintain the correct figure of \"HK$1 trillion,\" and use natural, fluent phrasing.\n- The phrase \"credit and liquidity risk management\" should be used as a noun phrase without the verb \"monitoring\" or \"regulating\" unless explicitly stated in the original.\n- The term \"lending capacity\" is more standard in financial contexts than \"lending space.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe banking sector plays an important role as a financial intermediary in the economy and society. Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to focus on credit and liquidity risk management for banks, while also closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and implementing various measures to ensure the banking sector could continue providing essential services and lending support to the economy. In March, the HKMA reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it lowered the regulatory reserve requirement. These measures collectively released approximately HK$1 trillion in lending capacity for the banking sector.\n\nWe are fully aware that SMEs may face cash flow pressures under the current economic environment. Therefore, the HKMA, together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism established in 2019, introduced multiple relief measures, including the PPPHS, which defers the repayment of principal on all eligible loans for six months. By the end of 2020, banks had processed over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total value of over HKD 740 billion. In response to the resurging pandemic, the HKMA extended the PPPHS and prolonged the program until the end of October 2021 in March 2021. Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also introduced the Special 100% Loan Guarantee under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to alleviate SMEs' burdens in paying employee salaries and rent. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving a total amount of approximately HKD 40 billion. The program was optimized in the first quarter of 2021, and the application deadline was extended to December 31, 2021. Throughout the year, banks also processed over 28,000 relief measure applications, assisting individual customers with their cash flow, involving a total amount of HKD 44 billion. The banking sector's united efforts in supporting both businesses and individual customers through these difficult times are indeed encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to promote the banking sector to enhance financial inclusion and foster a customer-centric culture. We further encourage banks to pay particular attention to customers in need and to share good practices in various aspects, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more barrier-free and accessible banking services.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the operating environment of the banking sector has undergone swift transformation. Therefore, the work of the HKMA is not limited to addressing current challenges but also involves looking ahead to expand the talent pool in alignment with the future development of the banking sector. We have jointly launched a research program titled \"Enhancing the Professional Development of Future Banking Talent\" with the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, aiming to assess potential talent gaps in the banking sector over the next few years and to provide banks with a clear roadmap to proactively address and improve the talent supply situation. We have also introduced the Banking Talent Programme, offering recent graduates from local universities a six-month internship and specific training related to the banking sector, thereby cultivating talent for the industry. Launching this program during a challenging period in the local labour market also provides opportunities for young people who aspire to join the banking sector.\n\n# Status as an International Financial Centre: Unfazed by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the HKMA's key responsibilities, which is to help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, our future plans cover the banking sector as well as the entire financial sector, aiming to ensure that Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial centre in an ever-evolving financial environment. During the pandemic, we have continued to steadily advance these efforts and actively explored new opportunities in several key areas to fully seize the opportunities presented by new trends and changes.\n\n# Promote Green Finance, Creating a More Sustainable Future\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, with the exception of the fifth junior translator, who used \"Disclosure\" (capitalized) and \"climaterelated disclosures\" (without a space), which should be \"climate-related disclosures\" as per the dictionary. The sixth junior translator also used \"Green and sustainable finance\" with a capital \"G\" in \"Green,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase version.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first, fourth, and sixth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The second and third translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"progress in this area has been satisfactory\" and \"significant progress has been achieved.\" The fifth translation has a few grammatical issues, including \"require Disclosure of climaterelated disclosures\" and \"formulating a regulatory framework.\"\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness and Nuance**: All translations are culturally appropriate, but the use of \"circular\" in the fifth and sixth translations is slightly less common than \"notice\" or \"guidance\" in this context. \"Notice\" is more standard in regulatory contexts.\n4. **Consistency and Style**: The first, fourth, and sixth translations maintain a consistent tone and style, using terms like \"fully advancing\" and \"strive to require\" effectively. The second and third translations use \"fully advancing the work of the second phase\" and \"fully advancing the second phase of work,\" which are slightly redundant.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**: The best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, use the dictionary terms accurately, and maintain a professional tone. It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing while ensuring clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe first area is promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of the three-phase approach in May 2019, related work has made ideal progress. In 2020, we completed the \"Greenness Baseline\" assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued a notice, providing guidance on managing climate risks for banks and sharing experiences. We are also fully advancing the second phase of work, establishing a regulatory framework for the banking sector to manage climate risks. Additionally, we will strive to require banks to disclose climate-related disclosures in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures by 2025 or earlier. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to implement such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world's largest reserves managers, the HKMA actively incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the selection, appointment, and monitoring processes of external fund managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investing in green, social, and sustainability bonds as well as low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong's green finance ecosystem, the HKMA has consistently assisted the government in issuing green bonds, and the recently issued second batch of government green bonds has been particularly well received by international investors. Capitalizing on this development trend, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021-22 Budget that the government will expand the scale of the Government Green Bond Programme, doubling the borrowing ceiling to HKD 200 billion, and will also increase the variety and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, one of our key strategies is to collaborate with local regulatory bodies and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the HKMA, together with other regulatory authorities, has established the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group to coordinate relevant measures across the financial sector. The group has already developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, the HKMA, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation, has become a founding member and the first regional anchor in the Asia region, working together with it to promote the \"Alliance for Green Commercial Banks.\" The alliance aims to promote green banking across global financial markets, starting from Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the aforementioned work to help reduce the climate risks faced by the financial sector and encourage Hong Kong banks to capitalize on their strengths to meet the substantial funding demands of green investments in the region.\n\n# Fintech Enhances Citizens' Lives and Benefits the Economy.\n\nAnother major engine driving growth in the financial sector is fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Fintech,\" \"FPS,\" and \"transaction volume.\" However, some translations inconsistently use \"FPS\" with quotation marks or without, and some retain the Chinese name \"轉數快\" in the English text, which should be replaced with \"FPS\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first, second, and fifth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The third and fourth translations have minor grammatical issues, such as \"played a role unprecedented\" and \"Since the launch... to the end of 2020,\" which is awkward phrasing. The sixth translation incorrectly retains the Chinese name \"轉數快\" in the English text, which is not appropriate.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The use of \"toolkit\" versus \"toolbox\" is interchangeable, but \"toolkit\" is slightly more formal and preferred in professional contexts. \"Surge 2.3 times\" is slightly awkward; \"surge by 2.3 times\" or \"increase by 2.3 times\" is more natural. \"2.3-fold increase\" is also acceptable but slightly more formal.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they accurately reflect the context of financial technology and government collaboration in a public service setting.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe past year has clearly demonstrated that fintech can expand our \"toolkit\" to address sudden shocks. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels have played an unprecedented role. From the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018 to the end of 2020, FPS had already recorded 6.9 million registered accounts. Even under the restrictions of social distancing measures, the public could still use FPS as a secure, fast, and reliable method for making payments and transferring funds, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the average daily transaction volume of FPS in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the application scope of FPS to cover the payment of more types of government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, fintech helps banks offer more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the HKMA have already commenced operations in Hong Kong this year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, with total customer deposits amounting to HKD 15 billion. Some of the virtual banks have already started using new types of data for credit assessment, aiming to tap into new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified regtech ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, in order to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to publishing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of regtech applications, the HKMA has also issued a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of regtech in the banking sector. Furthermore, the HKMA has launched the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" project to enable SMEs to more conveniently access banking financing by leveraging their own digital footprints.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the terms from the dictionary, such as \"HKMA,\" \"cyber resilience,\" \"credit risk,\" \"on-site examinations,\" \"credit risk assessment techniques,\" \"supervisory technology,\" and \"anti-money laundering.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, structure, and word choice that affect fluency and naturalness.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and accurate conveyance of the original message.\n- Generally fluent and grammatically correct English.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Some translations use \"fintech\" in lowercase, while others use \"Fintech\" with a capital \"F.\" The dictionary lists both, but \"Fintech\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The phrase \"to enhance the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes\" appears in some translations, while others use \"effectiveness and foresight\" or \"effectiveness and forward-looking nature of our supervisory processes.\" The latter is slightly more natural.\n- Some translations use \"supervisory technology applications\" while others use \"application of supervisory technology\" or \"supervisory technology (Suptech).\" The latter is more concise and natural.\n- The use of \"prudent supervision\" in one translation is slightly less common than \"rigorous regulation\" or \"rigorous supervision.\"\nImprovements could include:\n- Consistency in capitalization of \"Fintech.\"\n- Use of \"supervisory technology (Suptech)\" to introduce the acronym.\n- Slight rephrasing of phrases like \"enhance the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes\" to \"improve the effectiveness and foresight of regulatory processes\" for smoother flow.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining phrasing for naturalness and consistency.\nFinal Translation:\nThe landscape of Fintech is evolving rapidly, and the application of technology is becoming increasingly widespread. The HKMA must continue to maintain rigorous regulation. To this end, we have launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0 to enhance banks' cyber resilience. We have also strengthened on-site examinations of technology risk management and established a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products that utilize innovative credit risk assessment techniques. The HKMA has also initiated a three-year plan for the application of supervisory technology (Suptech) to improve the effectiveness and foresight of regulatory processes. Our current work includes more effectively leveraging data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering supervision.\n"}

The labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To cope with the severe economic environment, the government and the HKMA introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's banking sector remains sound, with good financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality remains at a sound level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the pandemic increasing uncertainties, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets operated smoothly and orderly, reflecting the stability of Hong Kong's monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered multiple times. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the Linked Exchange Rate System and market confidence in the system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic,\" which is slightly less common in formal contexts but still acceptable. The structure is clear and the terminology matches the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, but uses \"pandemic\" instead of \"epidemic,\" which is more appropriate in the context of a widespread health crisis. The use of \"has strengthened\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"regulating\" instead of \"supervising,\" which is a minor but notable difference. \"Regulating\" is more commonly associated with setting rules, while \"supervising\" is more about monitoring and ensuring compliance. The structure is clear and the terminology is correct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the second, with the exception of using \"regulating\" instead of \"supervising\" in one instance and \"supervision over\" instead of \"supervision of.\" The latter is slightly less idiomatic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation reorders the first clause, which slightly changes the emphasis. It uses \"monitoring\" instead of \"supervising\" in the second part, which is less precise in the context of regulatory oversight. The structure is still clear and the terminology is correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the exception of using \"is strengthening\" instead of \"has strengthened.\" The former is more present-focused, while the latter implies a completed action. The use of \"epidemic\" is again slightly less appropriate than \"pandemic.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"pandemic\" for consistency with global terminology, \"supervision\" for regulatory oversight, and maintain a consistent tense to reflect ongoing actions. The structure should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary reordering of clauses. The use of \"operational resilience\" and \"technology risk management\" should be consistent with the dictionary.\n**Improved translation**:\nWhile closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations, the HKMA continues to focus on supervising banks' credit and liquidity risk management. Given the ongoing increase in cyber risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the HKMA has strengthened its supervision of banks' technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as the protection of consumers of digital financial services.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Wealth Management Connect\" for \"跨境理財通.\"\n- The phrase \"family offices\" is consistently used for \"家族辦公室,\" which is the most natural and commonly used term in English financial contexts.\n- The use of \"pandemic\" is more appropriate than \"epidemic\" in this context, as it refers to a widespread outbreak.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and clear, with only minor variations in prepositions and phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"serving customers\" while others use \"providing services to customers.\" While both are correct, \"providing services to customers\" is more precise and commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The phrase \"formulated the implementation details\" is used in several translations. While correct, \"formulated\" may be slightly more formal than necessary. \"Developed\" or \"established\" could be alternatives, though \"formulated\" is still acceptable.\n- The use of \"guidelines\" versus \"guidance\" is a minor but notable difference. \"Guidance\" is more commonly used in regulatory and financial contexts, so it may be more appropriate than \"guidelines.\"\n- The use of \"businesses\" in \"wealth management businesses\" is slightly awkward. \"Wealth management services\" or \"wealth management business\" is more natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"providing services to customers\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"guidance\" instead of \"guidelines\" for regulatory context.\n- Use \"wealth management services\" or \"wealth management business\" instead of \"wealth management businesses.\"\n- Ensure that \"family offices\" is used consistently and that the term \"Wealth Management Connect\" is enclosed in quotation marks or properly capitalized as per the dictionary.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has given banks flexibility to continue providing services to customers during the pandemic. The HKMA has also collaborated with other relevant authorities to formulate the implementation details of the \"Wealth Management Connect\" pilot scheme, as well as to provide guidance on family offices and wealth management services.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the HKMA has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help banks more effectively respond to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continues to promote information sharing through public-private partnerships and supports the banking sector in adopting regulatory technology.\n\nSeveral junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in phrasing, tense usage, and clarity. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. The phrase \"will be introduced this year\" correctly reflects the original's future-oriented tone. The use of \"bank resolution regime\" is slightly redundant, as \"resolution regime\" is already used earlier.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, but uses the past tense \"have been introduced,\" which may not align with the original's implication of future implementation. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent, with a slightly more concise structure. The use of \"the banking sector's regulatory regime\" is slightly more natural than \"the regulatory regime of the banking sector.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The phrase \"Introducing multiple new rules and regulations\" is awkward and lacks a subject. The use of \"resolution execution capabilities\" (plural) is inconsistent with the dictionary entry, which specifies \"resolution execution capability\" (singular).\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but \"the second phase of three\" is awkward phrasing. The use of \"formulating related supervisory expectations\" is slightly less precise than \"developing the relevant supervisory expectations.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best versions, with a clear and natural structure. The use of \"will be launched within the year\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best translation should use future tense to reflect the original's implication of upcoming actions, avoid redundancy, and maintain consistency with the dictionary terms. The phrase \"resolution regime\" should be used consistently, and \"resolution execution capability\" should be used in the singular form as per the dictionary. The structure should be clear and natural, avoiding awkward phrasing such as \"the second phase of three.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent versions, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\nSeveral new rules and regulations will be introduced this year to strengthen the regulatory regime of the banking sector, aligning with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing the relevant supervisory expectations. The HKMA is also committed to establishing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and building resolution execution capability to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime.\n\n# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\nThe original title, \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位,\" is a heading that introduces a discussion about Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, each with slight differences in capitalization, punctuation, and formatting.\nThe first translation, \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,\" is grammatically correct and uses the term \"International Financial Centre\" as specified in the dictionary. However, it capitalizes \"Status\" unnecessarily, which may not be appropriate for a title unless it is part of a specific style guide.\nThe second translation, \"The Status of Hong Kong's International Financial Centre,\" is also grammatically correct but changes the structure of the original title, which may not be ideal for maintaining the intended emphasis.\nThe third translation, \"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,\" includes the hashtag symbol, which is not present in the original title and may be an unnecessary addition unless the context specifically requires it.\nThe fourth translation, \"Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status,\" uses an em dash and lowercase \"status,\" which is not in line with the dictionary's preferred translations and may not be appropriate for a title.\nThe fifth translation, \"# Hong Kong's status as an International Financial Centre,\" includes the hashtag symbol and uses lowercase \"status,\" which again may not be appropriate for a title.\nThe sixth translation, \"Hong Kong's international financial centre status,\" is the only one that uses the exact term \"international financial centre\" as specified in the dictionary and follows standard title capitalization rules. However, it uses lowercase \"status,\" which may not be ideal for a title.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status,\" which uses the exact term from the dictionary, follows standard title capitalization rules, and maintains the intended emphasis of the original title.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text but vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is concise and grammatically correct but omits the word \"development\" after \"fintech ecosystem,\" which is present in the original text. It also uses \"cross-border collaboration\" correctly.\n2. **Translation 2** is the most accurate in terms of content and structure. It includes \"development\" after \"fintech ecosystem,\" uses \"banking and payment sectors\" (which is more natural than \"industry\" in this context), and correctly uses \"cross-border collaboration.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"surged rapidly\" which is slightly redundant.\n3. **Translation 3** includes the term \"Zhuan Shu Kuai\" in quotes, which is unnecessary since the dictionary provides \"Faster Payment System\" as the translation. It also uses \"payment industries\" instead of \"payment sectors,\" which is less natural in this context.\n4. **Translation 4** omits the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" and uses \"HKMA\" without \"The\" in the last sentence, which is inconsistent. It also lacks the word \"development\" after \"fintech ecosystem.\"\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"Fintech\" with a capital \"F\" in the middle of the sentence, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"fintech\" (lowercase). It also includes \"Zhuan Shu Kuai\" in quotes, which is unnecessary.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best version but uses \"increased rapidly\" instead of \"surged,\" which is less impactful. It also omits the word \"development\" after \"fintech ecosystem.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with the banking and payment sectors increasingly adopting fintech. The transaction volume of the Faster Payment System has surged. The HKMA is actively participating in cross-border collaboration in areas such as CBDC.\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi business hub remains solid, and it continues to serve as a major gateway into mainland China. Hong Kong’s financial links with the mainland continue to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and connectivity mechanisms. Good progress was also made this year in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) proactive efforts to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform in three key areas: asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance. The junior translators have generally captured the core message, but there are notable differences in fluency, clarity, and grammatical accuracy.\nTranslation 1 is fluent and grammatically correct, clearly separating the three areas of focus with \"in areas such as.\" It uses the dictionary terms accurately and maintains a natural flow.\nTranslation 2 misplaces the phrase \"the competitiveness of asset and wealth management corporate treasury centres,\" which makes the sentence awkward and unclear. It also fails to clearly separate the three areas of focus.\nTranslation 3 correctly uses the dictionary terms but uses \"as well as the competitiveness in the green and sustainable finance sector,\" which is slightly awkward and less direct than \"the competitiveness of green and sustainable finance.\"\nTranslation 4 is clear and grammatically sound, correctly listing the three areas of focus and using the dictionary terms appropriately. It is very close to the best version.\nTranslation 5 incorrectly groups \"asset and wealth management corporate treasury centres\" as a single entity, which is not accurate. It also uses \"the green and sustainable finance sector\" instead of \"the competitiveness of green and sustainable finance,\" which is less precise.\nTranslation 6 is the most comprehensive, using \"strengthening the competitiveness of\" which adds nuance and clarity. It also correctly lists the three areas and uses the dictionary terms accurately.\nThe best possible translation should clearly separate the three areas of focus, use the dictionary terms accurately, and maintain a natural, fluent tone. It should also reflect the proactive and strategic nature of the HKMA's efforts.\nThe HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and the field of green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the complex and volatile investment environment, THE EXCHANGE FUND recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with an investment return of 5.3%, and all five major investment categories achieved positive returns.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Responsible Investment,\" \"asset diversification,\" \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" and \"annualised internal rate of return.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"annualised internal rate of return\" is accurate and appropriate in a financial context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice and Fluency:** Some translations use \"strive to promote\" (Translation 6), which is more verbose than necessary. \"Continue to promote\" (used in Translations 1, 2, 3, and 5) is more direct and commonly used in formal writing.\n- **Passive vs. Active Voice:** Translations 1, 3, and 5 use a more passive structure (\"The Long-Term Growth Portfolio's annualised internal rate of return...\"), while Translations 2, 4, and 6 use active phrasing (\"has achieved an annualised internal rate of return\"). The latter is more dynamic and preferred in professional writing.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** \"Since the commencement of its investment in 2009\" (Translation 5) is slightly wordy. \"Since commencing investments in 2009\" (Translation 3) is more concise and natural.\n- **Pronoun Usage:** Translation 6 uses \"its investment,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"its investments\" (plural), as the portfolio likely made multiple investments over time.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"continue to promote\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use active voice to enhance readability and professionalism.\n- Opt for \"since commencing investments in 2009\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"its investments\" to reflect the plural nature of the portfolio's activities.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and grammatically sound versions while ensuring clarity and natural phrasing.\nThe HKMA continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since commencing investments in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions and Social Responsibility\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upholds a high level of corporate governance, supporting employees in enhancing their professional development, maintaining financial discipline, and strengthening IT capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as increasingly demanding workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to commit to fulfilling corporate social responsibility, striving to become a responsible and sustainable organisation. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA has made special work arrangements to ensure the continued normal operation of key functions while safeguarding the health of its staff. The HKMA has also introduced various measures to support individuals and businesses in need, aiming to alleviate the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n"}

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Exchange Fund Bills\" and conveys the intended meaning clearly. The phrase \"amid the volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the global macro environment\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate, but it uses \"200 billion Hong Kong dollars worth of Exchange Fund Bills,\" which is slightly redundant. The phrase \"thereby helping to ensure\" is slightly less direct than \"help ensure.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation incorrectly states that the HKMA is \"issuing\" Exchange Fund Bills, whereas the original text says the HKMA is \"reducing the issuance\" of these bills. This is a critical error that changes the meaning of the sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"HKD 20 billion\" instead of \"HK$20 billion,\" which is a minor stylistic choice but still acceptable. The phrase \"in the face of volatility brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global macro environment\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"amid the volatility brought to the global macroeconomic environment by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" which is a natural and precise phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses \"issuing 20 billion Hong Kong dollars less in Exchange Fund Bills,\" which is awkward phrasing. It should be \"reducing the issuance of 20 billion Hong Kong dollars in Exchange Fund Bills.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct terminology. It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, but it can be refined for clarity and flow.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA announced that it will reduce the issuance of HK$20 billion in Exchange Fund Bills to increase overall Hong Kong dollar liquidity in the interbank market, and to help ensure the smooth operation of the Hong Kong dollar interbank market amid the volatility brought to the global macroeconomic environment by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# April 22nd\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 4月22日,\" where \"4月22日\" translates to \"April 22nd\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with the primary difference being the use of \"April 22nd\" versus \"April 22\" and the inclusion or exclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in translating the date itself. All translations correctly convey the date as \"April 22\" or \"April 22nd.\" However, there are some minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe use of \"April 22nd\" is more precise in terms of ordinal numbering, which is commonly used in English for dates. \"April 22\" is also acceptable, though it omits the \"nd\" suffix. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is questionable, as it does not have a clear function in this context and is not part of standard date formatting in English.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"April 22nd,\" as it is the most precise and commonly used format for dates in English. It is also consistent with standard English conventions and does not include any unnecessary symbols.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding a temporary liquidity facility aimed at supporting licensed banks and addressing liquidity strains in the US dollar interbank money markets. The dictionary provides specific terms that must be translated exactly, and all six junior translations correctly use these terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, using \"Liquidity\" consistently and correctly. However, it repeats \"Liquidity\" unnecessarily, which may affect readability.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very similar to the first but uses \"liquidity shortages\" instead of \"Liquidity strain,\" which is more natural in this context. It also adds \"global\" before \"US dollar interbank money markets,\" which is appropriate and enhances clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"provide US Dollar Liquidity\" instead of \"provide liquidity support,\" which is slightly less idiomatic. It also repeats \"Liquidity\" unnecessarily and omits \"global\" before the market name, which is less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is concise and uses \"liquidity tightness\" instead of \"Liquidity strain,\" which is a valid synonym. However, it omits \"global\" and uses \"HKMA\" without \"The,\" which is slightly less formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the second and is accurate, using \"liquidity shortages\" and \"global US dollar interbank money markets.\" It is fluent and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"liquidity crunch situation,\" which is a bit more colloquial than necessary for a formal announcement. It also uses \"HKMA\" without \"The,\" which is less formal.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best version should be formal, precise, and avoid unnecessary repetition. \"Liquidity shortages\" is more natural than \"Liquidity strain\" or \"liquidity tightness\" in this context. Including \"global\" before \"US dollar interbank money markets\" adds clarity. Using \"The HKMA\" is more formal and appropriate for an official announcement. Avoiding repetition of \"Liquidity\" improves readability.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the establishment of a temporary US Dollar Liquidity Facility to provide liquidity support to licensed banks and help alleviate liquidity shortages in the global US dollar interbank money markets.\n\n# October 23\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting an official announcement. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in style and grammatical structure that affect fluency and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Primary Liquidity Providers,\" \"offshore renminbi market,\" and \"authorized institutions\" or \"AIs.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is largely consistent across translations, with only minor differences in prepositions and verb tenses.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the\" before \"Primary Liquidity Providers,\" which is unnecessary and slightly informal.\n- **Translation 2** and **3** are very similar, with the only difference being the use of \"nine\" versus \"9.\" In formal writing, \"nine\" is preferred.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"AIs\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is acceptable but less clear for a general audience.\n- **Translation 5** adds \"that it has designated,\" which is grammatically correct but adds unnecessary complexity and changes the tone slightly.\n- **Translation 6** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with the same issue of using \"the\" before \"Primary Liquidity Providers.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"nine\" instead of \"9\" for a more formal tone.\n- Omit \"the\" before \"Primary Liquidity Providers\" to maintain the formal and concise style of the original.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" for clarity, unless the audience is known to be familiar with the acronym \"AIs.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as Primary Liquidity Providers in the offshore renminbi market.\n\n# November 25\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text: the People’s Bank of China and the HKMA have renewed a currency swap agreement for five years, with an expanded scale. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"People’s Bank of China\" (or \"PBOC\"), \"HKMA,\" and \"currency swap agreement.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate numerical formats and currency abbreviations (e.g., \"yuan\" and \"Hong Kong dollars\").\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows standard journalistic style.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical errors:** Several translations incorrectly convert the figures. The original text states \"4,000億元人民幣（4,700億港元）\" and \"5,000億元人民幣（5,900億港元）,\" which should be **400 billion yuan (470 billion HKD)** and **500 billion yuan (590 billion HKD)** respectively. However, translations 1, 2, 3, and 6 use \"47 billion\" or \"470 billion\" inconsistently, with some using \"47 billion\" instead of \"470 billion.\"\n- **Fluency and style:** Translation 4 uses \"RMB\" instead of \"yuan,\" which is acceptable but less common in formal news writing. Translation 3 introduces \"PBOC\" in parentheses, which is redundant since \"People’s Bank of China\" is already used.\n- **Verb tense and phrasing:** Translation 6 uses \"announce\" instead of \"announced,\" which is inconsistent with the past tense used in the other translations. Also, \"the agreement size\" is less formal than \"the scale of the agreement.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure numerical accuracy: Use \"400 billion yuan (470 billion Hong Kong dollars)\" and \"500 billion yuan (590 billion Hong Kong dollars).\"\n- Maintain consistent verb tense and formal tone.\n- Use \"yuan\" and \"Hong Kong dollars\" consistently, avoiding \"RMB\" unless necessary.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as using both \"People’s Bank of China\" and \"PBOC\" in the same sentence.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe People’s Bank of China and the HKMA announced that they have renewed a five-year currency swap agreement. The scale of the agreement has been expanded from the original 400 billion yuan (470 billion Hong Kong dollars) to 500 billion yuan (590 billion Hong Kong dollars).\n\n# Banking sector\nThe original text is a single term, \"銀行體系,\" which is defined in the dictionary as \"banking sector.\" All junior translators have correctly used this term, though with minor formatting differences. The first, fourth, and fifth translations simply use \"banking sector,\" which is accurate and appropriate. The second and third translations include a \"#\" symbol before the term, which may be an artifact of formatting or markdown and is unnecessary in standard English text. The sixth translation capitalizes the first letter of the term, which is acceptable in titles or headings but not necessary in a standalone term.\nThe best translation would be \"banking sector,\" as it is the most neutral and standard form, without unnecessary formatting or capitalization. It accurately reflects the meaning of \"銀行體系\" and adheres to the dictionary's requirement.\n\n# February 21\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"in response to the pandemic\" and \"non-face-to-face (non-F2F) distribution\" appropriately. However, the phrase \"have collaborated to review\" is slightly less precise than \"are collaborating to review\" in terms of tense and ongoing action.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"specific insurance products\" and \"non-F2F methods\" effectively. The inclusion of \"authorized institutions (AIs)\" adds clarity, though it may be redundant if \"AIs\" is already defined in the context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic\" is slightly less common in formal contexts, though still acceptable. The phrase \"allowing for the non-F2F distribution\" is slightly wordy compared to \"allowing non-F2F distribution.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise and grammatically sound. It uses \"specific insurance products\" and \"via non-F2F methods\" effectively. However, the use of \"collaborated\" in past tense may not fully capture the ongoing nature of the collaboration.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic,\" which is slightly less preferred in formal contexts, but otherwise is accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"specific insurance products\" and \"through non-F2F methods\" effectively. The phrase \"are collaborating to review\" accurately reflects the ongoing nature of the collaboration.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"pandemic\" is more commonly used in formal and official contexts than \"epidemic.\"\n- The phrase \"non-face-to-face (non-F2F) distribution\" should be used consistently, with the acronym introduced once.\n- The use of \"are collaborating\" is more appropriate than \"have collaborated\" or \"collaborated\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the collaboration.\n- The term \"authorized institutions\" should be used consistently, with \"AIs\" introduced once if needed for clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA and the Insurance Authority (IA) have introduced temporary facilitative measures in response to the pandemic, allowing non-face-to-face (non-F2F) distribution of specific insurance products, and are collaborating to review sandbox proposals involving authorized institutions distributing insurance products through non-F2F methods.\n\n# March 16\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement regarding a policy change by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The key elements are the announcement, the specific term \"逆周期緩衝資本比率\" (Countercyclical Capital Buffer), the adjustment from 2.0% to 1.0%, and the immediate effect of the change.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"will be reduced\" which is appropriate for a future-effective policy change. \"Effective immediately\" is standard in formal announcements.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate, but uses \"has been reduced\" which implies the change has already occurred, which may be slightly less precise than \"will be reduced\" in the context of an announcement.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"countercyclical capital buffer ratio\" is slightly redundant, as \"buffer\" already implies a ratio. \"Lowered\" is a synonym for \"reduced,\" which is acceptable, but \"taking effect immediately\" is slightly less formal than \"effective immediately.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the first, with the only difference being \"applicable in Hong Kong\" instead of \"applicable to Hong Kong.\" Both are correct, but \"applicable to\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The use of \"was reduced\" is less appropriate for an announcement of a new policy, as it implies the change is in the past rather than being newly implemented.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the first, with \"will be lowered\" instead of \"will be reduced.\" Both are correct, but \"reduced\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact term \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer\" as specified in the dictionary, maintain the formal tone of the original, and use the most appropriate verb tense to reflect the immediacy of the policy change. \"Effective immediately\" is more standard in formal announcements than \"taking effect immediately.\" The use of \"applicable to Hong Kong\" is also more precise than \"applicable in Hong Kong.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer applicable to Hong Kong will be reduced from 2.0% to 1.0%, effective immediately.\n\n# March 26\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the HKMA, in collaboration with the Social Welfare Department and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), has introduced measures to allow social security recipients in mainland China to receive assistance or subsidies remotely during the pandemic without returning to Hong Kong. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Social Welfare Department,\" \"Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB),\" and \"social security recipients.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and accurate.\n- The use of terms like \"remote channels,\" \"without needing to return to Hong Kong,\" and \"during the pandemic\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** uses \"from receiving the relevant grant or subsidy,\" which is awkward and grammatically incorrect.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"relief funds or allowances\" and \"distance channels,\" which are less precise than \"assistance or subsidies\" and \"remote channels.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic,\" which is less commonly used in formal English and may be considered outdated.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"allowances or subsidies,\" which is slightly less precise than \"assistance or subsidies.\"\n- **Translation 6** has a convoluted structure: \"the remote receipt of relevant relief funds or allowances through distance channels for social security recipients who are currently in mainland China,\" which is less fluent than the alternatives.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"pandemic\" instead of \"epidemic\" for consistency with modern terminology.\n- Use \"assistance or subsidies\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"remote channels\" instead of \"distance channels.\"\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and flows naturally in English.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Social Welfare Department and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), has introduced measures to facilitate social security recipients in mainland China to receive the relevant assistance or subsidies through remote channels without having to return to Hong Kong in person during the pandemic.\n\n# April 17th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 4月17日\". The \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or marker, and \"4月17日\" is the date in Traditional Chinese, meaning \"April 17th.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"April 17th\"** – This is a correct and natural translation of the date. However, it omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be important for formatting or context.\n2. **\"# April 17th\"** – This translation includes the \"#\" symbol and correctly translates the date. It is both accurate and natural.\n3. **\"April 17\"** – This is a valid date format but omits the \"th\" suffix, which is commonly used in English for clarity and formality.\n4. **\"April 17\"** – Same as above; lacks the \"th\" suffix.\n5. **\"April 17th\"** – Same as the first translation, missing the \"#\" symbol.\n6. **\"# April 17\"** – Includes the \"#\" symbol but omits the \"th\" suffix, making it less formal.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include both the \"#\" symbol and the full date format with the \"th\" suffix for clarity and formality. While the use of \"#\" may be context-dependent, it is common in lists or headings to include such markers. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be **\"# April 17th\"**, as it maintains both the structure and the formality of the original text.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding a new financial support plan for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The translations provided by junior translators mostly capture the core message but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"Pre-Approval Repayment of Interest Without Principal\" for \"預先批核還息不還本,\" which is accurate but not the abbreviation specified in the dictionary. It also uses \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers,\" which is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation correctly uses the abbreviation \"PPPHS\" as specified in the dictionary. However, it omits the term \"customers\" at the end, which is present in the original text and is important for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is similar to the second but uses \"program\" instead of \"plan.\" It also omits \"customers\" and uses \"enterprise (SME)\" instead of \"enterprises (SMEs),\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is concise and uses \"PPPHS\" correctly. However, it omits \"customers\" and uses \"enterprise (SME)\" instead of \"enterprises (SMEs),\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation uses the full name of the mechanism as specified in the dictionary and includes \"customers.\" However, it uses \"plan\" instead of \"scheme\" or \"program\" and repeats \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers,\" which is redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the most consistent with the dictionary, using \"PPPHS\" and \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers.\" However, it uses \"program\" instead of \"scheme\" and omits the term \"launch\" which is present in the original.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact abbreviation \"PPPHS\" for \"預先批核還息不還本.\"\n- Use \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Include the term \"customers\" as it appears in the original.\n- Use a natural and formal tone appropriate for an official announcement.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHKMA, together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the launch of the PPPHS to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers.\n\n# April 20\n\nHKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) has launched the \"Special 100% Loan Guarantee\" under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme and is now accepting applications.\n\n# April 24th is the most common and natural way to express this date in English. The use of \"th\" is standard for dates between 1st and 31st, except for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement or heading, which is not indicated in the original text. Therefore, the best translation is simply \"April 24th.\"\nApril 24th\n\nThe Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2020 have been gazetted.\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局因應疫情設立專責查詢服務，協助「預先批核還息不還本」計劃客戶**\nDictionary:  \n- **預先批核還息不還本**: ['PPPHS']  \n- **金管局**: ['HKMA']\n---\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   *\"The HKMA has established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the epidemic to assist clients of the PPPHS plan.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"HKMA\" and \"PPPHS\" from the dictionary. The structure is clear and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Epidemic\" is slightly outdated; \"pandemic\" is more appropriate for a large-scale outbreak like the one caused by the coronavirus. \"Plan\" is acceptable but \"scheme\" or \"program\" may be more natural in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   *\"HKMA set up a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist customers of the 'PPPHS' program.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"pandemic\" correctly and includes quotation marks around \"PPPHS\" as in the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" should be capitalized as \"HKMA\" (as per the dictionary). \"Customers\" is slightly less formal than \"clients,\" which may be more appropriate in a formal context like this.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   *\"The HKMA has established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the epidemic to assist clients of the PPPHS scheme.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"scheme\" effectively and \"clients\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Again, \"epidemic\" is outdated. \"Scheme\" is good, but \"program\" may be more commonly used in financial contexts.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The HKMA has set up a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist customers of the PPPHS program.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"pandemic\" and \"program\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Customers\" is less formal than \"clients.\" Also, \"set up\" is slightly less formal than \"established.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   *\"HKMA has set up a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist 'PPPHS' plan customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"pandemic\" and quotation marks around \"PPPHS.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" should be capitalized. \"Plan customers\" is awkward phrasing; \"customers of the PPPHS plan\" is better.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   *\"HKMA established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist PPPHS plan customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"pandemic\" and \"established\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" should be capitalized. \"Plan customers\" is awkward phrasing.\n---\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n- **\"HKMA\"** should be capitalized as per the dictionary.\n- **\"Pandemic\"** is more appropriate than \"epidemic\" for the current context.\n- **\"Clients\"** is more formal and appropriate in a financial or governmental context than \"customers.\"\n- **\"Program\"** is more commonly used in financial or policy contexts than \"plan\" or \"scheme.\"\n- The phrase **\"assist clients of the PPPHS program\"** is the most natural and grammatically correct.\n---\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist clients of the PPPHS program.\n\n# May 7th\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) has begun accepting applications for the Fixed-rate Mortgage Pilot Scheme.\n\n# May 8th\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of a Consultation Paper on the implementation of a Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme. The goal is to reduce the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a record of misconduct.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"issued\" and \"implementing\" correctly. However, it lacks the article \"the\" before \"Consultation Paper,\" which is slightly informal for a formal document.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very similar to the first, but it uses \"the implementation of\" instead of \"implementing.\" This is grammatically correct and slightly more formal, which is appropriate for a government document.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is identical to the first, with the same minor issue regarding the article \"the.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"has issued\" and \"hiring\" instead of \"employing.\" While \"has issued\" is grammatically correct, it implies a more recent action, which may not be necessary. \"Hiring\" is a valid synonym for \"employing,\" but \"employing\" is more formal and precise in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"has issued\" and \"hiring.\" It also uses \"records of misconduct\" instead of \"a record of misconduct.\" The plural \"records\" may be slightly off, as the original refers to a single record.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is identical to the first, with the same minor issue regarding the article \"the.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best version should be formal, precise, and grammatically correct. \"The HKMA issued a Consultation Paper on the implementation of the Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme to reduce the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a record of misconduct.\" This version uses \"the\" appropriately, \"implementation\" for formality, and \"employing\" for precision. It also avoids the use of \"has issued,\" which may imply a more recent action than intended.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued a Consultation Paper on the implementation of the Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme to reduce the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a record of misconduct.\n\n# May 22\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"金管局\" is consistently translated as \"HKMA\" and \"《銀行文化自我評估的檢視報告》\" as \"Report on Review of Self-assessments on Bank Culture.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, the translations vary slightly. The use of \"has released,\" \"has issued,\" and \"released\" are all grammatically correct, but \"has released\" and \"has issued\" are more formal and appropriate for official reports. \"Published\" is also acceptable but slightly less formal. The phrase \"providing the industry with a series of practices for reference\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"providing the industry with a series of practices to refer to\" or \"providing a series of practices for the industry as a reference.\"\nThe phrase \"for reference\" is more concise and commonly used in formal writing than \"to refer to\" or \"as a reference.\" Additionally, \"providing the industry with\" is more natural than \"providing a series of practices for the industry.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"has released\" for formality, \"Report on Review of Self-assessments on Bank Culture\" as per the dictionary, and \"providing the industry with a series of practices for reference\" for clarity and fluency.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is:\nThe HKMA has released a comprehensive Report on Review of Self-assessments on Bank Culture, providing the industry with a series of practices for reference.\n\n# May 29\n\nHKMCI announced the optimization measures for the \"80% and 90% Guarantee Products\" under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, effective immediately.\nThe best translation balances clarity, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. It uses \"80% and 90%\" for numerical precision, \"Guarantee Products\" as specified, and \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" for the program name. The phrase \"effective immediately\" is concise and natural in English. Other translations either used awkward phrasing (\"eight and nine-decade\"), unnecessary parentheses, or overly wordy constructions. The selected translation is accurate, natural, and respects the dictionary requirements.\n\n# June 4th\n\nHKMA announced the launch of the Banking Talent Programme in collaboration with the banking sector, providing short-term job opportunities and professional training for recent university graduates during the pandemic.\n\n# June 30\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of a regulatory body's announcement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in verb choice, prepositions, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"green and sustainable banking,\" and \"climate-related issues.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with the main elements (subject, action, object, and content) all present.\n- The use of \"white paper\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb choice:** \"Released\" vs. \"published\" – both are acceptable, but \"published\" may be more formal and commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Prepositions:** \"on\" vs. \"for\" – \"on green and sustainable banking\" is more natural than \"for addressing climate-related issues.\"\n- **Phrasing:** \"initial framework\" vs. \"initial thoughts\" – \"initial thoughts\" is more aligned with the original Chinese term \"初步構思,\" which implies early ideas or considerations rather than a fully formed framework.\n- **\"Supervisory approach\" vs. \"regulatory approach\"** – \"regulatory approach\" is more precise in the context of a regulatory body like the HKMA.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"published\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"on\" to introduce the subject of the white paper.\n- Use \"initial thoughts\" to reflect the meaning of \"初步構思.\"\n- Use \"regulatory approach\" for clarity and precision.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has published a white paper on green and sustainable banking, outlining its initial thoughts on the regulatory approach to addressing climate-related issues.\n\n# July 10th\n# 7月10日\nThe original text is a simple date written in Traditional Chinese. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, with minor variations in formatting. The first, second, sixth, and fifth translators correctly translated the date as \"July 10th,\" which is the standard format in English. The fourth translator used \"July 10\" without the \"th,\" which is less common in formal writing but still acceptable in informal contexts. The use of the \"#\" symbol in the fourth and fifth translations is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement not indicated in the original text.\nThe best translation should follow standard English date formatting, using \"July 10th\" without any unnecessary symbols. This format is widely recognized and maintains the clarity and formality of the original text.\n\nThe original sentence, \"金管局就加強監管信託業務的建議諮詢業界,\" translates to \"The HKMA is consulting the industry on recommendations to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with slight variations in wording and structure.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The HKMA consulted with the industry regarding recommendations to strengthen trust business regulation.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"consulted with\" which is grammatically correct and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses the past tense \"consulted,\" which may not be appropriate if the consultation is ongoing. Also, \"trust business regulation\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"regulation of trust business.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"HKMA is consulting the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses present continuous tense, which is appropriate if the consultation is ongoing. \"Proposals\" is a good synonym for \"recommendations.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is not capitalized, which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry that specifies \"HKMA\" as the correct translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Same as the second, but with \"HKMA\" capitalized.  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct capitalization of \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The HKMA is consulting the industry on proposed measures to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"proposed measures,\" which is a natural and formal expression.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than necessary, but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Same as the fourth.  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as above.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"HKMA is consulting the industry on the suggestion to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"suggestion\" as a synonym for \"recommendations.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is not capitalized, and \"the suggestion\" is less formal and less appropriate in a regulatory context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the present continuous tense to indicate an ongoing action.\n- Capitalize \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use a natural and formal synonym for \"recommendations\" (e.g., \"proposals\" or \"measures\").\n- Maintain the correct structure and flow of the sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is consulting the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\n\n# July 31st\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局就銷售政府及相關組織發行的合資格零售債券的簡化安排向銀行提供指引。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has issued guidance to banks on streamlined arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"HKMA\" and \"retail bonds.\" The verb \"issued\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Streamlined arrangements\" is slightly less precise than \"simplified arrangements.\" Also, \"has issued\" implies a completed action, which may not be the best fit if the guidance is ongoing.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has provided guidance to banks regarding the simplified arrangements for the sale of retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"simplified arrangements\" and \"retail bonds.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Provided\" is slightly less formal than \"issues\" or \"provides.\" Also, \"regarding\" is less direct than \"on.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA provides guidance to banks on the simplified arrangements for the sale of qualifying retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"qualifying\" instead of \"eligible,\" which is a valid synonym.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Qualifying\" may be less commonly used in this context than \"eligible.\" Also, \"provides\" is more present-tense and may not reflect the official nature of the guidance.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA provides guidance to banks on simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"eligible\" and \"simplified arrangements\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"on simplified arrangements\" is slightly less formal than \"on the simplified arrangements.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Identical to the fourth, so the same evaluation applies.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA provides guidance to banks on the simplified arrangements for selling qualified retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"qualified\" instead of \"eligible,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Selling\" is less formal than \"the sale of.\" Also, \"qualified\" is less standard in this context than \"eligible.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use **\"HKMA\"** and **\"retail bonds\"** as per the dictionary.\n- Use **\"eligible\"** for \"合資格\" as it is the most standard term in financial contexts.\n- Use **\"simplified arrangements\"** for \"簡化安排\" as it is more precise than \"streamlined\" or \"qualified.\"\n- Use **\"the sale of\"** rather than \"selling\" for formality and clarity.\n- Use **\"issues\"** or **\"provides\"** depending on whether the guidance is ongoing or a one-time action.\n### Final Translation:\n**The HKMA issues guidance to banks on the simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.**\n\n# August 5th\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement regarding a policy extension by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. The key elements are the names of the organizations, the policy name, and the specific extension of the repayment deferment for trade facilities.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** Correctly uses \"The HKMA\" and \"Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism.\" It uses \"extension of the 90-day repayment deferment\" and \"Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme.\" The grammar and structure are fluent and natural.\n2. **Translation 2:** Uses the full name \"Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism,\" which is more explicit but slightly wordy. It otherwise mirrors Translation 1 and is grammatically sound.\n3. **Translation 3:** Identical to Translation 1, with the same strengths and no weaknesses.\n4. **Translation 4:** Identical to Translation 1, with the same strengths and no weaknesses.\n5. **Translation 5:** Uses \"PPPHS\" instead of the full name, which is acceptable but less formal. It is grammatically correct but may be less suitable for a formal announcement.\n6. **Translation 6:** Identical to Translation 1, with the same strengths and no weaknesses.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nAll translations are very similar and mostly accurate. However, Translation 2 provides the full name of the SME mechanism, which may be preferable in a formal context for clarity. Translation 5 uses the acronym \"PPPHS,\" which is acceptable but less formal. The most balanced approach is to use the full name of the SME mechanism and the full name of the scheme, as this ensures clarity and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the 90-day repayment deferment for trade facilities under the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a regulatory context. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in tense, prepositions, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"IA,\" \"insurance products,\" \"supervisory expectations,\" and \"video conferencing tools.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with the main elements (HKMA and IA, collaboration, providing guidance, supervisory expectations, video conferencing tools, insurance products) all present.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense:** Some translations use the present tense (\"are collaborating,\" \"collaborate\"), while others use the past tense (\"have collaborated\"). The original text uses the present tense (\"合作\" – collaborate), so the present tense is more appropriate.\n- **Prepositions and phrasing:** Variations in prepositions like \"regarding,\" \"for,\" and \"on\" can subtly change the nuance. \"Regarding\" is more formal and precise in this context.\n- **\"Long-term insurance products\":** Only some translations include this, which is important for specificity. The original text explicitly mentions \"長期保險產品\" (long-term insurance products), so this should be included for accuracy.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the present tense to reflect ongoing collaboration.\n- Include \"long-term insurance products\" for specificity.\n- Use \"regarding\" for a more formal and precise preposition.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally in English while maintaining the formal tone of the original.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA and IA are collaborating to provide guidance to the industry on the supervisory expectations regarding the use of video conferencing tools for the sale of long-term insurance products.\n\n# August 20\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) relaxing countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties, specifically increasing the loan-to-value ratio caps for general cases from 40% to 50%. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, clarity, and structure.\n**Translation 1** is clear and accurate, using \"relaxed\" and \"increasing\" in a straightforward manner. However, it repeats \"the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps\" in the second sentence, which is slightly redundant.\n**Translation 2** is concise and avoids redundancy by combining the two sentences into one. It uses \"increasing\" and \"from 40% to 50%\" effectively, but it omits the phrase \"for such loans,\" which may slightly reduce clarity.\n**Translation 3** uses \"eased\" instead of \"relaxed\" and \"eligible cases\" instead of \"general cases.\" While \"eased\" is a valid synonym, \"eligible cases\" may not be the best fit for \"一般個案\" (general cases), which is more about typical or standard cases rather than qualifying ones.\n**Translation 4** mirrors Translation 1 in structure and clarity, but it also repeats \"the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps\" in the second sentence, which is redundant.\n**Translation 5** is well-structured and includes \"for such loans,\" which adds clarity. It uses \"raising\" and \"increased\" appropriately, and the sentence flow is smooth.\n**Translation 6** is slightly more complex and uses \"with the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps for such loans increased,\" which is grammatically correct but less direct than the other translations.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"relaxed\" or \"eased\" for \"放寬\" – both are acceptable, but \"relaxed\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"general cases\" for \"一般個案\" – \"eligible cases\" may be misleading.\n- Avoid redundancy by combining the two sentences into one where possible.\n- Ensure clarity by including \"for such loans\" to specify the type of loans affected.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be concise, clear, and grammatically sound, using \"relaxed\" and \"general cases\" while avoiding redundancy.\nThe HKMA has relaxed countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps for such loans. The cap for general cases has been increased from 40% to 50%.\n\n# September 2\n\nTo alleviate the cash flow pressure on SMEs, HKMCI announced that the application period for the principal moratorium under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme for the 80% and 90% Guarantee Products will be extended by six months, until March 31, 2021.\n\nOn the same day, the HKMA, together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the PPPHS scheme for another six months until April 30, 2021.\n\n# September 4th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing a notice requiring banks to implement optimized disclosure measures, specifically targeting retail and SME customers applying for unsecured loans and credit card products on digital platforms. The key terms to be translated exactly are \"中小企\" (SME or SMEs), \"披露\" (Disclosure), \"無抵押貸款及信用卡產品\" (unsecured loan and credit card products or AIs’ unsecured loan and credit card products), and \"金管局\" (HKMA).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"SME customers\" and \"unsecured loans and credit card products.\" However, \"dual alerts\" is a bit vague and may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"雙重提示.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"enhanced Disclosure\" (with capital D), which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry. Also, \"AIs’ unsecured loan and credit card products\" is an unusual and possibly incorrect use of \"AIs\" (which may refer to artificial intelligence, not relevant here). \"Dual confirmation\" is not the best fit for \"雙重提示.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"enhanced disclosure\" and \"double reminders.\" While \"double reminders\" is more natural than \"dual alerts,\" \"enhanced\" may not be the best fit for \"優化的.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"optimized disclosure\" and \"double prompts.\" \"Double prompts\" is a natural choice for \"雙重提示,\" and \"digital platforms\" is correctly used. However, \"retail personal customers\" is slightly less precise than \"retail individual customers.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"circular\" instead of \"notice,\" which is a minor but notable deviation. \"Dual notifications\" is a good fit for \"雙重提示,\" and \"SMEs\" is correctly used. However, \"through digital platforms\" is slightly less natural than \"on digital platforms.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"enhanced disclosure\" and \"double warnings.\" \"Double warnings\" is too strong and may imply a negative connotation not present in the original. \"Through digital platforms\" is slightly less natural than \"on digital platforms.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary, \"Disclosure\" with a lowercase \"d\" (unless it's a proper noun, which it is not in this context), \"SMEs\" for \"中小企,\" and \"unsecured loan and credit card products\" for \"無抵押貸款及信用卡產品.\" The phrase \"雙重提示\" should be translated as \"dual prompts\" or \"double reminders,\" with \"double reminders\" being more natural in this context. \"Digital platforms\" is more natural than \"through digital platforms.\" \"Optimized\" is a better fit for \"優化的\" than \"enhanced.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued a notice requiring banks to implement optimized disclosure measures, providing \"double reminders\" to retail individual customers and SMEs applying for unsecured loan and credit card products on digital platforms.\n\n# September 18\n\nUnder the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, the maximum loan amount for each enterprise under the Special 100% Loan Guarantee has been increased to the total of 12 months' employee salaries and rent, or HKD 5 million, whichever is lower; the maximum repayment period has been extended to 5 years.\n\n# September 29\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) releasing a report on enhancing AML\/CFT supervision through data and supervisory technology as part of its Digitalisation Programme. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, grammar, and word choice.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"AML\/CFT Supervision in the Age of Digital Innovation,\" \"AML\/CFT,\" \"Digitalisation Programme,\" and either \"supervisory technology\" or \"Suptech.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** \"Released\" and \"published\" are both acceptable, but \"published\" is more formal and appropriate for official reports.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use \"its\" redundantly (e.g., \"HKMA's Digitalisation Programme\" vs. \"its Digitalisation Programme\"). Also, \"strengthen the application\" is slightly more formal than \"enhance the application,\" but both are acceptable.\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"supervisory technology\" while others use \"Suptech.\" The former is more commonly used in formal contexts, while the latter is a shorter, more technical term.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"published\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"supervisory technology\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"its\" only once when referring to the Digitalisation Programme.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has published the report \"AML\/CFT Supervision in the Age of Digital Innovation,\" outlining how it will strengthen the application of data and supervisory technology in its risk-based AML\/CFT supervision as part of its Digitalisation Programme.\n\n# September 30\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, and the junior translators have generally captured the core meaning. However, there are variations in fluency, structure, and emphasis that affect the clarity and naturalness of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"retail banks,\" \"insurance products,\" and \"mystery shopping programme.\"\n- The main idea—that the HKMA shared observations and practices with the industry regarding a programme on retail banks' sales of investment and insurance products—is preserved in all versions.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"key observations,\" \"best practices,\" and \"shared with the industry.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"its mystery shopping programme on the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks.\" The phrase \"on the sale of\" is slightly awkward and less direct than \"for the sale of.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"from the mystery shopping programme on retail banks' sales...\" The preposition \"from\" may imply the programme itself produced the findings, which is slightly off. Also, \"best practices\" is more commonly used than \"good practices\" in formal contexts.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"for retail banks selling investment and insurance products.\" This is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"for the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"key findings\" instead of \"key observations,\" which is a minor but notable deviation from the original. \"Findings\" implies data or results, while \"observations\" implies insights or notes.\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"regarding the mystery shopping programme for the sale of...\" which is natural and clear.\n- **Translation 6** is similar to 5 but uses \"for retail banks selling...\" which is slightly less precise than \"for the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"key observations\" as in the original.\n- Use \"best practices\" as it is more standard in formal contexts.\n- Use \"regarding the mystery shopping programme for the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks\" to maintain clarity and precision.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA shared its key observations and best practices with the industry regarding the mystery shopping programme for the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks.\n\n# November 2\n\nHKMC announced that the application period for the \"Fixed-rate Mortgage Pilot Scheme\" will be extended for one year to October 30, 2021.\nHKMC announced that the application period for the \"Fixed-rate Mortgage Pilot Scheme\" will be extended for one year to October 30, 2021.\n\n# November 3\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"risk management and compliance\" for \"風險管理及合規.\"\n- The use of \"regulatory technology\" or \"Regtech\" for \"合規科技\" is consistent with the dictionary options.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, with only minor variations in verbs such as \"formulated,\" \"devised,\" \"developed,\" and \"contained.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The verb \"formulated\" is used in translations 1, 3, and 5, which is appropriate but slightly formal. \"Developed\" (translation 4) and \"devised\" (translation 2) are also acceptable but may vary in tone.\n- The phrase \"which is outlined in\" (translation 1) and \"which is contained in\" (translations 3 and 5) are both grammatically correct, but \"as detailed in\" (translation 2) and \"as outlined in\" (translation 4) are more commonly used in formal writing.\n- The title of the white paper is translated consistently as \"Leveraging the Power of RegTech: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance\" or \"Leveraging the Power of Regulatory Technology: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance.\" While both are correct, \"RegTech\" is more concise and commonly used in industry contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"developed\" as a more natural and commonly used verb in this context.\n- Use \"as outlined in\" for smoother flow.\n- Use \"RegTech\" in the title for conciseness and industry alignment.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has developed a two-year plan to promote the adoption of RegTech in the local banking sector, as outlined in the white paper titled \"Leveraging the Power of RegTech: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0,\" \"cyber resilience,\" \"banking sector,\" and \"cyber risk management.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"thereby\" or \"in order to\" effectively conveys the purpose of the initiative.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"reflecting... and incorporating...\" which is slightly less direct than \"to reflect... and incorporate...\" used in the other translations.\n- The second translation omits \"The\" before \"HKMA,\" which is less formal and slightly less natural in English.\n- The third and sixth translations are very similar and use \"thereby elevating\" and \"thereby enhancing,\" respectively. \"Elevating\" is slightly more formal and precise in this context.\n- The fourth and fifth translations use \"most up-to-date\" and \"managing cyber risks,\" which are slightly more verbose or wordy than necessary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The phrase \"to reflect the latest trends in technological development\" is more direct and natural than \"reflecting the latest technological trends.\"\n- \"Incorporate the latest global practices in cyber risk management\" is more concise and precise than \"incorporate the most up-to-date global practices in managing cyber risks.\"\n- \"Thereby elevating the cyber resilience of the banking sector to a higher level\" is more formal and precise than \"thereby enhancing... to a higher level.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the launch of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0 to reflect the latest trends in technological development and incorporate the latest global practices in cyber risk management, thereby elevating the cyber resilience of the banking sector to a higher level.\n\n# December 15th\n\nWith the support of the HKMA, the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the DTC Association jointly issued the Guideline on Banking Services for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities, outlining recommended principles and best practices to provide banking services to customers in need.\n\n# December 18th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with the primary difference being the use of \"18th\" versus \"18\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nThe first, fifth, and sixth translations use \"December 18th,\" which is the most standard and natural way to express the date in English, especially in formal or written contexts. The second and third translations use \"December 18\" and include the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the \"#\" is meant to denote a heading or section. However, in many English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used with dates unless it's part of a specific formatting convention.\nGiven that the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it is reasonable to retain it in the translation if it serves a formatting or structural purpose. However, in most English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not used with dates unless it's part of a specific system or format. Therefore, the most natural and fluent translation would be \"December 18th\" without the \"#\" symbol, unless there is a specific reason to include it.\nIn conclusion, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is \"December 18th.\"\n\nHKMA announced the launch of the Enhanced Competency Framework module on operational risk management to promote talent development in the banking sector and enhance the professional development of industry professionals.\n\n# December 23rd\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol preceding the date. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth translations all correctly identify the date as \"December 23rd\" or \"December 23,\" with slight variations in the use of the ordinal suffix \"-rd\" and the presence of the \"#\" symbol. The third translation omits the ordinal suffix, which is less common in formal English writing.\nThe \"#\" symbol is often used in English to denote a heading or section title, so its inclusion is appropriate in this context. However, in some cases, it may be unnecessary or stylistically inconsistent depending on the document's format.\nThe most fluent and natural translation would be \"December 23rd,\" as it includes the ordinal suffix, which is standard in English for dates. The \"#\" symbol can be retained if it is stylistically appropriate for the context, but it is not essential for the translation of the date itself.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is \"December 23rd.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the provision of guidance to banks. The sentence structure is complex, with two main components: (1) guidance on providing investment services through non-face-to-face channels, and (2) guidance on simplifying investment product disclosures for a specific group of customers.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"regarding\" effectively and correctly applies the dictionary terms. However, \"regarding investment services offered through non-face-to-face channels\" could be slightly more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"has issued guidance\" is slightly more formal than necessary, and \"Disclosure\" is capitalized unnecessarily. The rest is accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"on offering\" and \"on simplifying the disclosure,\" which is natural and clear. However, \"the disclosure of investment products\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"regarding both the provision of investment services\" and \"the simplification of investment product disclosures,\" which is grammatically sound and clear. However, \"regarding both the provision\" is slightly more formal than needed.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version. It uses \"on offering\" and \"on simplifying disclosure,\" which is natural. However, \"disclosure\" is not capitalized, which is correct, but \"simplifying disclosure\" is slightly less formal than \"simplifying the disclosure.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is mostly correct, but \"is providing\" is unnecessarily dynamic, and \"Disclosure\" is capitalized incorrectly.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use natural English phrasing. It should also correctly apply the dictionary terms. The most natural and fluent phrasing is found in the third and fifth translations, with slight variations in prepositions and article usage. The best choice is to use \"on offering\" and \"on simplifying the disclosure of investment products,\" as this is the most natural and clear phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA provides guidance to banks on offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels and on simplifying the disclosure of investment products for sophisticated non-retail banking customers.\n\n# December 31st\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a consultation summary related to public consultations on proposed subsidiary legislation under section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance (Cap. 628). The legislation aims to suspend the termination rights of financial contracts applicable to authorized institutions (AIs), and the HKMA has sought industry feedback on the draft rules.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of legal terminology. However, the phrase \"pursuant to section 92\" is slightly formal and could be more natural in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is clear and concise. The use of \"as suggested under section 92\" is slightly less precise than \"under section 92\" but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate but slightly wordy, particularly with \"which were suggested to be established through subsidiary legislation.\" This could be more direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very accurate and natural. It uses \"under section 92\" correctly and clearly conveys the relationship between the legislation and the proposed rules.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The use of \"temporary suspension\" is slightly different from the original, which uses \"暫停\" (suspension), not necessarily implying \"temporary.\" Also, \"enacted as subsidiary legislation\" is slightly off from the original, which refers to \"以附屬法例形式訂立.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"in the form of subsidiary legislation\" correctly and \"sought industry feedback\" is a natural phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in tone. It should use the correct legal terminology and maintain the original meaning without unnecessary elaboration. The fourth and sixth translations are both strong, but the fourth one more precisely captures the structure of the original sentence and uses \"under section 92\" correctly. It also uses \"authorized institutions\" as per the dictionary, which is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA published a consultation summary on its public consultation under section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance (Cap. 628) regarding proposed rules in the form of subsidiary legislation to suspend the termination rights of financial contracts for authorized institutions, and consulted the industry on the draft rules.\n\n# Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text: “香港的國際金融中心地位.” The primary task is to translate the term “國際金融中心” using one of the three acceptable English alternatives from the dictionary: “international financial centre,” “International Financial Centre,” or “International financial centre.” All translations correctly use one of these forms, which is a positive point.\nHowever, the translations vary in terms of fluency, grammar, and stylistic appropriateness. The first translation, “Hong Kong's international financial centre status,” is grammatically correct and fluent, but it uses lowercase for “international financial centre,” which may not be the preferred style in formal or official contexts. The second translation, “# Hong Kong's status as an International Financial Centre,” includes a hashtag, which is not appropriate in this context and may be a formatting error. The third translation, “The Status of Hong Kong's International Financial Centre,” is grammatically correct but feels more like a title than a statement, and it uses a possessive structure that is less common in English for such expressions. The fourth translation, “Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status,” is very similar to the first but uses an apostrophe for “Hong Kong’s,” which is more natural in modern English. The fifth translation, “# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,” again includes an unnecessary hashtag. The sixth translation, “Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,” is grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate, though it uses “Status” with a capital letter, which may be more suitable in a formal or titled context.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and stylistic appropriateness, the best option would be to use “Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status,” which is grammatically correct, uses the possessive form naturally, and maintains the lowercase form for “international financial centre” as per the dictionary. This version is concise, clear, and stylistically appropriate for a general or formal context. It avoids unnecessary capitalization and formatting elements like hashtags, which are not relevant here. It also maintains the intended meaning of the original text without adding or omitting any information.\n\n# January 22nd\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text but vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"central banking\" for \"中央銀行,\" which is incorrect. The correct term should be \"central bank\" or \"Bank of Thailand.\" It also uses \"announced the joint research plan on Central Bank Digital Currency — the results of Project Inthanon-LionRock — and published a research report,\" which is awkwardly structured.\n2. **Translation 2** correctly uses \"Bank of Thailand\" for \"泰國中央銀行\" and \"CBDC\" for \"央行數碼貨幣.\" It also uses \"aimed to explore\" for \"旨在研究,\" which is slightly less direct than \"aims to study.\" The structure is more fluent than Translation 1.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"CBDC\" and \"Central Bank Digital Currency\" interchangeably, which is inconsistent. It also uses \"released\" instead of \"published,\" which is less formal and less appropriate for a research report.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Thai central bank\" for \"泰國中央銀行,\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"Bank of Thailand.\" It uses \"program\" instead of \"project,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary term \"project.\"\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"Bank of Thailand\" and \"CBDC\" appropriately. However, it uses \"aimed to study\" in the past tense, which is inconsistent with the present tense used in the first sentence.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"CBDC\" consistently and \"Thai central bank\" for \"泰國中央銀行.\" However, it omits the em dash around \"Project Inthanon-LionRock,\" which affects readability.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- Use \"Bank of Thailand\" for \"泰國中央銀行\" as it is the official name.\n- Use \"CBDC\" for \"央行數碼貨幣\" as it is the more concise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n- Use \"project\" for \"項目\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"published\" for \"發表\" as it is more formal and appropriate for a research report.\n- Maintain consistent tense: \"aims to study\" in the present tense to match the first sentence.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand announced the results of their joint research project on CBDC — Project Inthanon-LionRock — and published a research report. The project aims to study the application of CBDC in cross-border payments.\n\n# February\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Evaluation and Compliance Working Group,\" \"Financial Action Task Force,\" and \"anti-money laundering.\" The only variation in terminology is the use of \"Co-Chair\" (with a capital \"C\") versus \"co-chair\" (lowercase), which is a matter of style rather than correctness. \nThe first translation uses \"was appointed,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than the present perfect tense used in the other translations. The second, third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"has been appointed,\" which is more natural in this context, as the appointment is relevant to the present. The fourth translation also uses \"has been appointed\" and adds \"Co-Chair\" with a capital letter, which is acceptable but not strictly necessary unless it is a formal title.\nIn terms of fluency and clarity, all translations are very similar. The only notable difference is in the phrasing of the sentence about the headquarters of the Financial Action Task Force. Some translations use \"headquartered in Paris, France,\" while others use \"with its headquarters in Paris\" or \"headquartered in Paris.\" All are correct, but \"headquartered in Paris, France\" is the most concise and natural.\nThe best translation would combine the most natural phrasing with the correct use of the dictionary terms. It should use the present perfect tense (\"has been appointed\") and include the full location (\"Paris, France\") for clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe HKMA has been appointed as Co-Chair of the Evaluation and Compliance Working Group under the Financial Action Task Force for a two-year term from 2020 to 2022. The Financial Action Task Force is the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering, headquartered in Paris, France.\n\n# Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text: “香港的國際金融中心地位.” The primary task is to translate the term “國際金融中心” using one of the three acceptable English alternatives from the dictionary: “international financial centre,” “International Financial Centre,” or “International financial centre.” All translations correctly use one of these forms, which is a positive point.\nHowever, the translations vary in terms of fluency, grammar, and stylistic appropriateness. The first translation, “Hong Kong's international financial centre status,” is grammatically correct and fluent, but it uses lowercase for “international financial centre,” which may not be the preferred style in formal or official contexts. The second translation, “# Hong Kong's status as an International Financial Centre,” includes a hashtag, which is not appropriate in this context and may be a formatting error. The third translation, “The Status of Hong Kong's International Financial Centre,” is grammatically correct but feels more like a title than a statement, and it uses a possessive structure that is less common in English for such expressions. The fourth translation, “Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status,” is very similar to the first but uses an apostrophe for “Hong Kong’s,” which is more natural in modern English. The fifth translation, “# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,” again includes an unnecessary hashtag. The sixth translation, “Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre,” is grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate, though it uses “Status” with a capital letter, which may be more suitable in a formal or titled context.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and stylistic appropriateness, the best option would be to use “Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status,” which is grammatically correct, uses the possessive form naturally, and maintains the lowercase form for “international financial centre” as per the dictionary. This version is concise, clear, and stylistically appropriate for a general or formal context. It avoids unnecessary capitalization and formatting elements like hashtags, which are not relevant here. It also maintains the intended meaning of the original text without adding or omitting any information.\n\n# May 5th\n\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms. All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Securities and Futures Commission\" for \"證券及期貨事務監察委員會.\" The term \"綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\" is translated as \"Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group,\" which is one of the two acceptable options from the dictionary. The only variation among the translations is the use of \"initiated\" versus \"launched\" and the inclusion of the definite article \"The\" before \"HKMA.\"\n\"Initiated\" and \"launched\" are both acceptable verbs in this context, though \"launched\" may carry a slightly more formal or official tone, which is appropriate for describing the formation of a formal steering group. However, \"initiated\" is also correct and commonly used in official contexts.\nThe use of \"The\" before \"HKMA\" is optional. While \"HKMA\" is an acronym and typically does not require the definite article, including \"The\" does not make the sentence incorrect. However, in formal writing, it is more common to omit the article when referring to organizations by their acronyms unless the article is necessary for clarity or grammatical correctness.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would use \"launched\" for a more formal tone and omit the article before \"HKMA\" for consistency with standard usage of acronyms.\nFinal translation:\nHKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission jointly launched the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group.\n\n# May 20th\n\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are subtle differences in verb choice, article usage, and phrasing that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"香港貨幣及金融研究中心\" is translated as either \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" or \"HKIMR,\" and \"香港銀行業金融科技採用和創新\" is consistently translated as \"Fintech Adoption and Innovation in the Hong Kong Banking Industry.\"\n- The term \"應用金融研究報告\" is translated as \"Applied Research report\" or \"Applied Research reports,\" with the singular form being more appropriate in this context since it refers to a single report.\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of \"released\" versus \"published\" is a minor but notable difference. \"Published\" is more commonly used in academic or research contexts, which aligns better with the nature of the report.\n- The inclusion of the article \"the\" before \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" is more natural in English and improves readability.\n- The use of the present perfect tense (\"has published\") in one translation is less appropriate here, as the action is completed and not ongoing.\nImprovements:\n- Use \"published\" instead of \"released\" for a more formal and academic tone.\n- Include the definite article \"the\" before the institute's name for grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n- Use the singular form \"Applied Research report\" to match the singular context of the report.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research published its first Applied Research report titled \"Fintech Adoption and Innovation in the Hong Kong Banking Industry.\"\n\n# June 29\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"unveiling the pilot scheme for Wealth Management Connect\" – \"unveiling\" is slightly less formal than \"announcing\" or \"launching,\" which may not be ideal for an official announcement. It also uses \"AMCM\" instead of the full name \"Monetary Authority of Macao,\" which may be less clear to a general audience.\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and uses \"launch the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme.\" It correctly uses \"PBoC\" and \"AMCM\" but omits the word \"jointly,\" which is important for emphasizing the collaborative nature of the announcement.\n3. **Translation 3** uses the full name \"Monetary Authority of Macao\" and includes the word \"announcing the launch of the 'Wealth Management Connect' pilot program.\" It is clear and accurate, though \"program\" is slightly less precise than \"scheme\" in this context.\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 3 but uses \"pilot scheme\" instead of \"pilot program.\" It also uses the full name \"Monetary Authority of Macao\" and the phrase \"to launch,\" which is slightly more direct than \"announcing the launch.\"\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"declaring the launch of a pilot scheme for the Wealth Management Connect.\" \"Declaring\" is more formal and may be appropriate, but \"a pilot scheme for the Wealth Management Connect\" is slightly less direct than \"the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme.\"\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"in conjunction with\" and \"business pilot program.\" While \"in conjunction with\" is a valid alternative to \"together with,\" \"business pilot program\" is less precise than \"pilot scheme\" in this context.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- The phrase \"issued a joint announcement\" is more natural than \"issued a joint announcement to launch\" or \"announcing the launch of.\"\n- \"Wealth Management Connect\" should be used as the primary term, with \"pilot scheme\" as the secondary term, as per the dictionary.\n- The full name \"Monetary Authority of Macao\" is preferred over the acronym \"AMCM\" for clarity, unless the context is highly technical.\n- \"Announcing the launch of\" is more natural and commonly used in official announcements than \"declaring the launch of\" or \"unveiling.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the PBoC and the Monetary Authority of Macao, issued a joint announcement announcing the launch of the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\n# August 3rd\n\nHKMA and the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre launched the TechChallenge Digitising Trade Finance initiative.\n\n# August 19\n\nThe original text describes two sessions of a meeting hosted by the HKMA Chief Executive, with the first session occurring via video conference and the second on November 16, also via video conference. The key terms to be translated are \"東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)\" and \"金管局總裁.\"\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Governors’ Meeting of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" which is unnecessarily convoluted and grammatically awkward. The term \"EMEAP\" is repeated redundantly.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Executive Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" which is more concise and accurate. However, \"Executive Meeting\" may not be the most precise term for the type of meeting described.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Meeting of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" which is redundant and confusing. The term \"Executives’ Meeting\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Executive Meeting of the EMEAP (EMEAP)\" which is concise but includes the abbreviation twice, which is redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"EMEAP Governors' Meeting\" which is more concise and accurate. However, \"Governors' Meeting\" may not be the exact term used by EMEAP.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" which is accurate and concise. However, \"Executives’ Meeting\" may not be the most precise term for the type of meeting described.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe term \"東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)\" should be translated as \"Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" as it is the most accurate and concise option from the dictionary. The term \"金管局總裁\" should be translated as \"HKMA Chief Executive\" as it is the most natural and commonly used term in English.\nThe phrase \"第25屆行長級會議第一節\" should be translated as \"the first session of the 25th Governors’ Meeting\" to reflect the formal and official nature of the meeting. The term \"行長級\" refers to a meeting of governors or heads of central banks, so \"Governors’ Meeting\" is more appropriate than \"Executive Meeting.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Chief Executive chaired the first session of the 25th Governors’ Meeting of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) via video conference. The second session of the meeting was held via video conference on November 16.\n\n# August 21st\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, where the \"#\" symbol is often used to denote a heading or section title. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, with minor variations in formatting.\nThe first, second, third, sixth, and seventh translations all use \"August 21st,\" which is the standard English format for dates. The fourth translation uses \"August 21,\" which is also acceptable but lacks the \"st\" suffix, which is commonly used in English to denote ordinal numbers. The fifth translation includes the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original text but may not be necessary in English unless the \"#\" is used for a specific formatting purpose.\nThe best possible translation would be \"August 21st\" as it is the most natural and commonly used format in English for dates. It is also consistent with the majority of the junior translators' work and adheres to standard English conventions.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research published its second Applied Research report titled \"Artificial Intelligence in Banking: The Changing Landscape in Compliance and Supervision.\"\n\n# August 31st\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Cap. 637) has been implemented, enabling investment funds to be established in Hong Kong as limited partnerships. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"limited partnerships,\" \"investment funds,\" and \"Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Cap. 637).\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"allowing\" or \"allows\" is appropriate in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"came into effect\" (e.g., Translation 1 and 4), which is slightly more formal and less commonly used in legal or regulatory contexts compared to \"has been implemented\" or \"allows.\"\n- The placement of \"Cap. 637\" varies, with some placing it after the ordinance name (e.g., Translation 5) and others before (e.g., Translation 1). While both are acceptable, placing it after the name is more standard in legal writing.\n- The phrase \"in the form of\" (used in Translations 1, 2, and 3) is slightly more verbose than \"as\" (used in Translations 4, 5, and 6), which is more concise and natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"has been implemented\" to reflect the completed action of the ordinance's implementation.\n- Place \"Cap. 637\" after the full name of the ordinance for clarity and consistency with legal conventions.\n- Use \"as\" instead of \"in the form of\" for conciseness and natural phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n**The Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Cap. 637) has been implemented, allowing investment funds to be established in Hong Kong as limited partnerships.**\n\n# November 2nd to 6th\n# 11月2至6日\nThe original text is a simple date range: \"11月2至6日,\" which translates to \"November 2 to 6.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with slight differences in formatting and the use of ordinal numbers.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"November 2nd to 6th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses ordinal numbers consistently, which is appropriate in formal or written English.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than necessary, but still correct.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# November 2nd to 6th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Matches the original formatting with the hashtag.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of a hashtag is not standard in formal English unless the context is social media or informal communication.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"November 2 to 6\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Simple and concise.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses cardinal numbers instead of ordinal numbers, which may be less formal.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# November 2 to 6\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Matches the original formatting with the hashtag.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the second translation, the hashtag may be unnecessary unless the context requires it.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# November 2 to 6\"**  \n   - **Same as the fourth translation.**\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# November 2-6\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses a hyphen for brevity, which is common in informal contexts.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag may be unnecessary unless the context requires it.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The original text is a simple date range, and the most natural and widely accepted format in English is to use ordinal numbers: \"November 2nd to 6th.\"\n- The use of a hashtag is not standard in formal English and should be omitted unless the context specifically requires it.\n- The use of cardinal numbers (\"November 2 to 6\") is acceptable in informal contexts but less formal than using ordinal numbers.\n- The use of a hyphen (\"November 2-6\") is more common in informal or abbreviated contexts.\n**Best possible translation:**\nNovember 2nd to 6th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"Commercial Data Interchange\" as specified in the dictionary. However, it uses \"viewers\" instead of \"attendees,\" which is less precise in the context of a conference or event. It also uses \"foster a fintech ecosystem conducive to supporting various enterprises,\" which is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is concise and accurate, using \"CDI\" as per the dictionary. It uses \"businesses of all types\" instead of \"various enterprises,\" which is more natural in English. However, it omits the quotation marks around \"Commercial Data Interchange,\" which may be important for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"Commercial Data Interchange\" without quotation marks. It uses \"businesses of all kinds\" and \"particularly SMEs,\" which is natural but slightly less formal than \"especially SMEs.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is well-written and includes the full name of HKMA in parentheses, which adds clarity. It uses \"visitors\" instead of \"viewers\" or \"attendees,\" which is appropriate. It also uses \"favorable fintech ecosystem that supports the growth of various businesses,\" which is more nuanced than some other translations.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"attendees\" instead of \"viewers,\" which is more appropriate for an event. However, it incorrectly states \"over 120,000 attendees\" instead of \"over 1.2 million,\" which is a significant error. It also uses \"Commercial Data Interchange (CDI)\" with the acronym in parentheses, which is good for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate, using \"Commercial Data Interchange\" and \"SMEs\" as specified. However, it includes the phrase \"conducive to promoting fintech,\" which is redundant since the ecosystem is already for fintech.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Use appropriate terminology for events (e.g., \"attendees\" instead of \"viewers\").\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.\nBased on this, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fourth and sixth translations, using \"attendees,\" including the full name of HKMA, and avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and InvestHK co-hosted the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020,\" attracting over 1.2 million attendees from more than 130 economies. They announced a series of initiatives, including \"Commercial Data Interchange\" and connecting \"eTradeConnect\" with the PBoC Trade Finance Platform, to develop a favorable fintech ecosystem that supports the growth of various businesses, especially SMEs.\n\n# November 3\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about a jointly organized event. The key elements are the event name, the number of the dialogue, the format (online), and the two organizing bodies: the HKMA and the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"jointly held online\" and correctly places the organizational structure. However, \"held\" is slightly less formal than \"organized\" or \"co-hosted.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is correct and natural. \"Co-hosted via online format\" is slightly awkward; \"via online format\" is not the most idiomatic way to express the event's format.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The phrase \"under its State Secretariat\" is incorrect. The State Secretariat is a unit under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, not the other way around. This is a structural error.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"jointly organized online\" and correctly structures the relationship between the Swiss Federal Department of Finance and the State Secretariat.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the fourth, but uses \"in an online format\" instead of \"online.\" While both are correct, \"online\" is more concise and natural in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most concise and natural translation. It uses \"co-hosted online,\" which is a common and formal expression in event announcements.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and accurately reflect the formal tone of the original. It should also correctly represent the hierarchical relationship between the Swiss Federal Department of Finance and the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters. The phrase \"co-hosted online\" is the most idiomatic and formal expression of the event's format. The structure \"under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance\" is correct and clearly conveys the relationship between the two organizations.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 4th \"Hong Kong and Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue\" was co-hosted online by the HKMA and the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance.\n\n# November 9th\n\nHKMA and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, have signed a new partnership agreement to promote the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks, encouraging Asian commercial banks to develop relevant strategies and goals for a greener future.\n\n# November 16\n\nThe original sentence is: \"在政府債券計劃下發行第七批零售通脹掛鈎債券(iBond)。\"\nThe junior translators have all correctly used the dictionary terms: \"iBond\", \"通脹\" as \"inflation\", and \"政府債券計劃\" as \"Government Bond Programme\". This is a strength across all translations.\nHowever, there are differences in verb tense and phrasing that affect fluency and clarity. The first, third, and fifth translations use \"has been issued\", \"is issued\", and \"was issued\" respectively. These variations reflect different temporal perspectives, but the original sentence does not specify a particular time frame. The most neutral and commonly used form in such contexts is the present perfect tense (\"has been issued\"), which indicates a completed action with relevance to the present.\nThe second and third translations use \"tranche\" and \"batch\" respectively. While both are acceptable, \"tranche\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to a portion of a larger issue, making it slightly more appropriate here.\nThe fourth and sixth translations use the gerund form \"Issuing...\", which is grammatically correct but less direct than a full declarative sentence. The original sentence is a statement of fact, so a declarative structure is more appropriate.\nThe fifth translation uses the past tense \"was issued\", which may imply that the action is completed and no longer relevant, which may not be the case depending on the context.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would use the present perfect tense (\"has been issued\") for clarity and relevance, and \"tranche\" for its financial connotation. The sentence should be a full declarative statement for clarity and formality.\nImproved Translation:\nThe seventh tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) has been issued under the Government Bond Programme.\n\n# November 24\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research published its third Applied Research report titled \"The Green Bond Market in Hong Kong: Developing a Robust Ecosystem for Sustainable Growth\".\n\n# November 27th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, written as \"# 11月27日\". The \"#\" symbol is often used in Chinese to denote a heading or a section title, similar to how English might use a heading or a label.\nThe junior translators have provided several translations, all of which are essentially correct in terms of translating the date. However, there are minor differences in formatting:\n- The first junior translator used \"November 27th\", which is a fully correct and natural English date format.\n- The second, fifth, and sixth junior translators used \"# November 27\", which preserves the \"#\" symbol from the original text. This may be appropriate if the \"#\" is meant to denote a heading or section, as in the original.\n- The third and fourth junior translators used \"November 27\", which is also correct but omits the \"th\" suffix, which is common in English for dates.\nThe best translation would be to preserve the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading or label, and to use the full date format with the \"th\" suffix for natural English usage. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"# November 27th\".\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical correctness, and consistency in terminology.\nFirstly, the term \"處置機制\" appears in the original text and is listed in the dictionary with two possible translations: \"resolution regime\" and \"Resolution.\" While all translations correctly use one of these terms, some translations use \"Resolution\" with a capital \"R\" inconsistently, which may imply a proper noun rather than a general term. It is more appropriate to use \"resolution regime\" in this context, as it refers to a structured system or framework.\nSecondly, the use of \"Chair\" versus \"Chairman\" is a matter of style rather than correctness. Both are acceptable, but \"Chair\" is more commonly used in formal and institutional contexts, which aligns well with the context of the original text.\nThirdly, the phrase \"the group is a dedicated resolution regime organization\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"a dedicated organization under the resolution regime\" or \"a dedicated organization for the resolution regime.\"\nFourthly, the phrase \"among relevant authorities in the region\" is slightly repetitive and can be rephrased for better flow, such as \"among regional authorities\" or \"among relevant regional authorities.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the correct terminology, ensure grammatical accuracy, and enhance fluency and readability.\nThe HKMA announced its appointment as Chair of the Study Group on Resolution of EMEAP; this group is a dedicated organization under the resolution regime, providing support for knowledge sharing and discussions on cross-border resolution among regional authorities.\n\n# December 6th\n# 12月6日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headlines or titles. The junior translators have all provided translations that are technically correct, as \"December 6th\" is the standard way to express this date in English. However, there are minor differences in formatting that are worth considering.\nThe first, second, third, fifth translators have translated the text as \"December 6th\" without any additional formatting. This is a clean and straightforward translation that is appropriate for most contexts.\nThe fourth and sixth translators have included a \"#\" symbol before the date, as in \"# December 6th.\" This formatting is often used in social media or online platforms to denote a hashtag or a title. However, in formal or standard English writing, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date formats unless it is part of a specific platform's style guide.\nGiven that the original text is simply \"12月6日\" without any additional formatting, the most appropriate translation would be \"December 6th\" without the \"#\" symbol. This preserves the original meaning and format while adhering to standard English conventions.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is \"December 6th.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the introduction of a new feature by the Faster Payment System (\"轉數快\") that allows citizens to bind their bank accounts using their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers to receive payments from institutions. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, grammar, and word choice.\nStrengths across the translations include the accurate use of the dictionary terms \"Faster Payment System\" and \"Hong Kong Identity Card number.\" However, some translations use \"bind\" or \"link\" interchangeably, which is acceptable but \"link\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. The use of \"issued by institutions\" or \"organizations\" is also consistent, though \"institutions\" may be more precise in this context.\nThe first translation uses \"FPS\" as an abbreviation, which is not in the dictionary and may not be familiar to all readers. The second and third translations use \"bind\" and \"function\" respectively, which are slightly less natural than \"link\" and \"feature.\" The fourth translation is the most fluent and grammatically sound, using \"link... with... through their banks\" in a natural structure. The fifth translation uses \"bind\" and \"organizations,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal. The sixth translation uses \"introduces\" and \"via banks,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluid than \"through their banks.\"\nImprovements could focus on consistency in verb choice (\"link\" over \"bind\"), clarity in prepositional phrases, and the use of more formal terms like \"institutions\" over \"organizations.\" The best translation would use \"link,\" \"through their banks,\" and \"institutions\" for a natural and precise result.\nThe original text is translated as follows:\nThe Faster Payment System has launched a new feature allowing citizens to link their bank accounts through their banks using their Hong Kong Identity Card number to receive funds issued by institutions.\n\n# December 14 to 15\nThe original text is a simple date range: \"12月14至15日,\" which translates to \"December 14 to 15.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, most of which are correct but differ slightly in formatting and punctuation.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"December 14th to 15th\"** – This is grammatically correct but unnecessarily adds the ordinal suffix \"-th\" to both dates. In English, it's common to use \"December 14 to 15\" without the \"-th\" when listing a range.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# December 14-15\"** – The use of the hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary unless it's part of a specific formatting requirement. The hyphen is acceptable, but the hashtag adds no value here.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# December 14 to 15\"** – Similar to the second translation, the hashtag is unnecessary. The phrase \"December 14 to 15\" is correct and natural.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"December 14 to 15\"** – This is the most natural and concise translation. It avoids unnecessary punctuation and formatting, and it is in line with standard English conventions for expressing date ranges.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# December 14th to 15th\"** – Again, the hashtag is unnecessary, and the use of \"-th\" is redundant.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"December 14 to 15\"** – This is identical to the fourth translation and is also correct.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe most natural and concise translation is \"December 14 to 15.\" It avoids unnecessary punctuation, such as the hashtag, and does not add redundant ordinal suffixes. It is in line with standard English conventions for expressing date ranges and is the most fluent and readable option.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about a collaborative event hosted by two entities. The key elements are the \"Centre for Green Finance,\" the \"HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office,\" the \"International Finance Corporation (IFC),\" and the event name \"IFC Climate Business Webinar.\" The dictionary provides exact translations for these terms, and the junior translators mostly adhere to them, though with some variations in structure and phrasing.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, it lacks clarity in the relationship between the \"Centre for Green Finance\" and the \"HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office.\" The phrase \"set up by\" is acceptable, but \"established by\" is more formal and precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"established by\" and includes quotation marks around the event name, which adds clarity. However, it redundantly mentions \"International Finance Corporation\" after \"IFC,\" which is unnecessary since \"IFC\" is already an acronym for that organization.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise but omits the \"International Finance Corporation\" after \"IFC,\" which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the acronym. It also lacks quotation marks around the event name, which could be important for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is similar to the second, but it uses \"co-organized\" instead of \"co-hosted.\" While both are acceptable, \"co-hosted\" is more commonly used in the context of events. It also includes the full name of the IFC after the acronym, which is redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of content and structure. It clearly states the relationship between the \"HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office\" and the \"Centre for Green Finance.\" However, it omits the full name of the IFC after the acronym, which may be necessary for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most refined translation. It uses \"jointly hosted\" and \"inaugural\" to add formality and precision. It also avoids redundancy by using only \"IFC\" after the full name. The structure is clear and concise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and avoid redundancy. It should clearly establish the relationship between the entities and use the correct terminology from the dictionary. The use of \"inaugural\" adds a formal tone, and \"jointly hosted\" is more appropriate than \"co-hosted\" or \"co-organized\" in this context. The inclusion of quotation marks around the event name adds clarity, and the use of \"IFC\" alone after the full name avoids redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office’s Centre for Green Finance and the IFC jointly hosted the inaugural \"IFC Climate Business Webinar.\"\n\n# December 17\n<\/think>\nDecember 17\n\nThe original text discusses the release of a strategic plan by the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, aimed at strengthening Hong Kong's financial ecosystem from six areas. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group,\" \"strategic plan,\" \"financial ecosystem,\" and \"green and sustainable finance.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"released\" or \"issued\" is appropriate for the context of publishing a plan.\n- The phrase \"from six aspects\" or \"six areas\" is acceptable, though \"six areas\" sounds more natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"CrossAgency\" without a hyphen, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preferred form \"Cross-Agency.\"\n- The second translation omits \"green\" in \"green and sustainable finance,\" which is a key term and should not be excluded.\n- The fourth translation uses \"consolidate\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is a less common term in this context and may be less clear to readers.\n- Some translations use \"has released\" (present perfect), while others use \"released\" (simple past). Both are grammatically correct, but \"has released\" may be more appropriate for emphasizing the relevance of the action to the present.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group\" consistently with the hyphen.\n- Retain \"green and sustainable finance\" in full, as it is a key term.\n- Use \"strengthen\" rather than \"consolidate\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"has released\" to emphasize the current relevance of the action.\n- Use \"six areas\" for a more natural and idiomatic expression.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group has released a strategic plan for green and sustainable finance, outlining six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem.\n\n# December 21\n\nThe original sentence, \"轉數快付款功能擴展至政府繳費櫃枱及自助服務機,\" translates to a statement about the expansion of a payment system's functionality to specific government service points. The dictionary provides two acceptable translations for \"轉數快\": \"Faster Payment System\" and \"FPS.\" All junior translators have used one of these terms appropriately, though with varying levels of fluency and precision.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Faster Payment System payment functionality has been extended to government payment counters and self-service kiosks.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Faster Payment System,\" accurate translation of \"自助服務機\" as \"self-service kiosks.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Payment functionality\" is slightly awkward; \"payment function\" is more concise and natural in English.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The Faster Payment System payment function has been expanded to government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Natural phrasing, correct use of \"Faster Payment System,\" and accurate translation of \"自助服務機\" as \"self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Expanded\" is slightly less precise than \"extended\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"FPS payment functionality has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"FPS,\" accurate translation of \"自助服務機\" as \"self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Payment functionality\" is less natural than \"payment function.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"FPS Payment Function is Extended to Government Fee Payment Counters and Self-Service Machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"FPS,\" accurate translation of \"自助服務機\" as \"self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title-case phrasing is overly formal and unnatural for a news-style sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The Faster Payment System (FPS) payment function has been extended to government fee payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and natural phrasing, correct use of both \"Faster Payment System\" and \"FPS,\" and precise translation of \"繳費\" as \"fee payment.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The Faster Payment System payment function has been extended to government fee payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Natural and accurate, with correct use of \"Faster Payment System\" and precise translation of \"繳費\" as \"fee payment.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and precise. It should use either \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS\" as appropriate, and accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. The fifth and sixth translations are both strong, but the sixth is slightly more concise and avoids the redundancy of including \"(FPS)\" in parentheses. It also uses \"fee payment\" to accurately reflect \"繳費,\" which is more precise than \"payment.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Faster Payment System payment function has been extended to government fee payment counters and self-service machines.\n\n# December 22nd is the most appropriate format for a date in English, as it includes the ordinal indicator (\"nd\") which is commonly used in formal and informal writing. While \"December 22\" is also correct, it lacks the ordinal suffix and may appear less complete in certain contexts. The use of a hashtag (#) before the date is unnecessary and does not conform to standard English date formatting. Therefore, the best translation would be \"December 22nd.\"\nDecember 22nd\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行第五批銀色債券,\" translates to \"Issue the fifth batch of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Programme.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The fifth batch of Silver Bonds was issued under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of the dictionary terms, passive voice is appropriate for formal statements.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less dynamic than active voice, but still acceptable in formal contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Issue the fifth batch of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Active voice, direct and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks a time reference (e.g., \"was issued\" or \"has been issued\"), which may be important in formal reporting.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The fifth Silver Bond has been issued under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses present perfect tense, which implies recent action.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly uses \"Silver Bond\" (singular) instead of \"Silver Bonds\" (plural), which contradicts the original text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The fifth batch of Silver Bonds was issued under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first translation, which is accurate and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above—passive voice may be less dynamic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Issue the fifth batch of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second translation—active voice, concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above—lacks a time reference.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The fifth tranche of Silver Bonds is issued under the Government Bond Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"tranche\" as an alternative to \"batch,\" which is appropriate in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Is issued\" is in present tense, which may not align with the original intent of the sentence (which implies a completed action).\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and accurately reflect the original meaning. The original sentence is a formal statement about the issuance of bonds, which is typically reported in passive voice in official contexts. However, active voice can also be appropriate if the focus is on the action itself.\nThe use of \"batch\" is acceptable, but \"tranche\" is a more precise financial term and may be preferable in this context. However, the dictionary specifies \"Silver Bond\" and \"Government Bond Programme,\" so we must use those exact terms.\nThe most accurate and fluent translation would be to use the passive voice with \"was issued\" to reflect a completed action, while using \"batch\" as per the dictionary. This aligns with the formal tone of the original sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fifth batch of Silver Bonds was issued under the Government Bond Programme.\n\n# December 17, 21, and 22\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of an official meeting between financial authorities. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, prepositions, and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Association of Banks,\" and \"video conferencing tools.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is largely consistent across translations, with the main elements (who, what, how, and why) clearly conveyed.\n- The use of \"mainland financial regulators\" or \"mainland financial management departments\" is appropriate, though \"regulators\" is more commonly used in English financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"annual meetings\" (plural), which may not align with the original's \"年度會晤\" (annual meeting), suggesting a singular event.\n- The second and third translations use \"Chinese financial regulatory authorities\" and \"mainland financial regulators,\" respectively. While both are acceptable, \"mainland\" is more neutral and commonly used in official contexts.\n- The fourth translation uses \"financial management departments,\" which is a direct translation but less idiomatic than \"regulators\" or \"authorities.\"\n- The fifth translation uses \"financial affairs\" and \"both places,\" which are less precise than \"financial sectors\" or \"both regions.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"on both sides,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"in both regions.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"annual meeting\" (singular) to match the original's \"年度會晤.\"\n- Use \"mainland financial regulators\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"financial sectors\" to reflect the economic focus of the discussion.\n- Use \"in both regions\" for consistency and formality.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA led a delegation from the Hong Kong Association of Banks to hold an annual meeting with mainland financial regulators via video conferencing tools, discussing recent developments in the financial sectors of both regions.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# December 18th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with the primary difference being the use of \"18th\" versus \"18\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nThe first, fifth, and sixth translations use \"December 18th,\" which is the most standard and natural way to express the date in English, especially in formal or written contexts. The second and third translations use \"December 18\" and include the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the \"#\" is meant to denote a heading or section. However, in many English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used with dates unless it's part of a specific formatting convention.\nGiven that the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it is reasonable to retain it in the translation if it serves a formatting or structural purpose. However, in most English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not used with dates unless it's part of a specific system or format. Therefore, the most natural and fluent translation would be \"December 18th\" without the \"#\" symbol, unless there is a specific reason to include it.\nIn conclusion, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is \"December 18th.\"\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the tone of an official announcement. The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are variations in style, grammar, and punctuation that affect fluency and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio,\" and \"Future Fund.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is largely preserved, with the main clause indicating the HKMA's action and the subordinate clause specifying the subject of the survey.\n- Most translations use appropriate verbs such as \"conduct a market survey\" or \"market investigation.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense:** Some translations use \"would\" (e.g., Translation 5 and 6), which is less direct than \"will\" and may imply uncertainty or hypothetical action, which is not appropriate for an official announcement.\n- **Punctuation:** The use of quotation marks and apostrophes varies. While this is not a major issue, consistency in punctuation improves readability.\n- **Prepositions:** \"Regarding\" (Translation 1 and 4) and \"into\" (Translation 5) are both acceptable, but \"on\" is more commonly used in formal announcements.\n- **Fluency:** Translation 4 is slightly more concise and avoids the use of \"which,\" making it more direct. However, it may be less clear in separating the subject of the survey from its context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"will\" to reflect the certainty of the announcement.\n- Use \"on\" as the preposition for \"conduct a market survey on.\"\n- Maintain consistency in punctuation (e.g., use of quotation marks or apostrophes).\n- Ensure clarity by using \"which is part of\" to clearly link the \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio\" to the \"Future Fund.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced that it will conduct a market survey on the \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio,\" which is part of the government's \"Future Fund.\"\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# November 13\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning. However, there are variations in fluency, grammatical correctness, and the use of vocabulary that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"public education online drama series 'STEPS',\" and \"social media platforms.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with the main idea being that the HKMA launched a drama series on social media to introduce its work.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"different areas of its work,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"work in different areas,\" which is more concise but slightly less natural.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"various work areas of the HKMA,\" which is awkward and repetitive.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"across various areas,\" which is natural and concise.\n- **Translation 5** introduces \"departments,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the original text and may be an over-interpretation.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"introducing\" instead of \"to introduce,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, concise, and natural in English. It should avoid unnecessary repetition and should not introduce elements not present in the original text. \"Across various areas\" is a natural and concise way to express the range of work. Also, using \"its\" to refer to the HKMA is more natural than repeating \"the HKMA.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nHKMA launched the public education online drama series “STEPS” on its social media platforms to introduce its work across various areas.\n\n# December 31st\n\nIn reviewing the translations, all six versions correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"financial data,\" and \"Open Application Programming Interface.\" However, there are differences in fluency, structure, and emphasis.\nThe first translation is clear and grammatically correct, but the phrase \"for free public use\" is slightly awkward. The second translation is more natural, with \"available to the public for free use\" being a smoother expression. The third translation is also grammatically correct but places \"through an Open Application Programming Interface\" in the middle of the sentence, which may disrupt the flow. The fourth and fifth translations are very similar, with the fifth being slightly more precise in its structure. The sixth translation uses \"for citizens to use free of charge,\" which is correct but slightly more formal than the others.\nThe best version would maintain clarity, natural flow, and proper emphasis on the key elements: the year (2020), the entity (HKMA), the action (opened\/made available), the data (financial data), the method (Open Application Programming Interface), and the accessibility (free public use).\nImproved Translation:\nIn 2020, the HKMA made an additional 11 sets of financial data published on its website available to the public for free use through the Open Application Programming Interface.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US Treasury yields"],"2018鈔票系列":["2018 Series of Banknotes"],"2020年對外部門報告":["External Sector Report

Consumption and tourism-related industries were particularly hard hit, with their contraction more severe than that of the overall economy. At the same time, the labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the largest-ever relief measures to support the economy. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to restore normal economic activity, with growth anticipated in 2021. However, the strength and pace of economic recovery will remain influenced by numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp decline in economic activity was primarily due to a drastic contraction in local demand (Figure 1). The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption activities. Due to the deteriorating business environment, overall investment expenditure also significantly decreased. Externally, although the pandemic caused supply chain disruptions and a global demand contraction, Hong Kong's total goods exports only slightly declined for the year, partly benefiting from the rapid resumption of production and economic activities in mainland China. In contrast, Hong Kong's service exports were severely affected due to lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions that brought the global tourism industry to a standstill. Weak demand driven by local and re-export activities also led to a decline in goods imports and service inputs. As the decline in import volumes outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to the gross domestic product (Figure 1). By economic sector, consumer and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food services, were particularly hard hit, experiencing contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector experienced moderate growth.\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"紓困措施\" as \"relief measures,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" \"流動性\" as \"Liquidity,\" \"銀行業\" as \"banking sector,\" \"防疫抗疫基金\" as \"Anti-Epidemic Fund,\" and \"2020至21年度《財政預算案》\" as \"2020–21 Budget.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, preserving the logical flow of the information.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical errors:** Several translations incorrectly state \"3,000 billion HKD\" instead of \"300 billion HKD.\" This is a critical error that affects the accuracy of the information.\n- **Inconsistent use of \"Liquidity\":** In some translations, \"Liquidity\" is capitalized unnecessarily, which is not standard in English unless referring to a specific term or concept.\n- **Variations in program names:** The term \"保就業\" is translated inconsistently as \"Job Retention Scheme,\" \"Job Protection,\" or \"Employment Retention Scheme.\" The most accurate and commonly used term is \"Job Retention Scheme.\"\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations are overly wordy or repetitive, such as using \"thereby supporting the real economy\" instead of a more concise phrasing.\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"financial turnover pressures\" instead of \"financial pressures.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly use the dictionary terms.\n- Accurately reflect the numerical data (300 billion HKD, not 3,000 billion).\n- Use consistent and standard terminology for programs like \"保就業\" as \"Job Retention Scheme.\"\n- Maintain a natural, fluent tone without unnecessary repetition or awkward phrasing.\n- Ensure that terms like \"Liquidity\" are used appropriately (lowercase unless referring to a specific concept).\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various junior translations while correcting their weaknesses.\n---\nThe government swiftly introduced the largest-scale relief measures in history through the 2020–21 Budget to respond to the pandemic, disbursing four rounds of subsidies from the Anti-Epidemic Fund, totaling over HK$300 billion. These measures included a one-time cash payment of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the \"Job Retention Scheme,\" and one-time grants, rent reductions, and fee waivers for industries severely impacted by the pandemic. The HKMA supported the banking sector through a three-pronged approach to sustain the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with the banking sector to alleviate financial pressures on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks' lending capacity, and ensuring that banks have sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures clearly weakened in 2020. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis of 2009. Price pressures for basic food items, especially fresh pork, significantly eased; and apart from home cooking, dining out prices also declined in the second half of the year due to significant discounts offered by the catering industry. With the earlier decline in newly signed private residential rents, the growth of the consumer price index's rent component also softened (Figure 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures decreased due to slower growth in nominal wages and softer commercial property rents; and under the weak world economy, import price inflation eased.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"seasonally adjusted,\" \"labour market,\" \"SARS,\" and \"private-sector.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data points (e.g., unemployment rates, figures, and economic indicators) are accurately translated.\n- Most translations use natural English phrasing and maintain the formal tone appropriate for economic reporting.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use \"labour\" while others use \"labor,\" which is acceptable but should be consistent. \"Labour\" is more commonly used in British English, while \"labor\" is more common in American English.\n- **\"Job Protection\" vs. \"Job Retention\" vs. \"Employment Retention\":** The original Chinese term for the government program is not explicitly provided, but the dictionary does not include it. However, the term \"保就業\" is best translated as \"Job Retention\" or \"Employment Retention,\" which is more accurate than \"Job Protection.\"\n- **\"Cyclical response\" vs. \"cyclical reaction\":** Both are acceptable, but \"cyclical response\" is more commonly used in economic contexts.\n- **\"Nominal wage and income\" vs. \"Nominal wages and income\":** The plural form \"wages\" is more natural when referring to a general trend.\n- **\"Time-limited\" vs. \"temporary\":** Both are acceptable, but \"time-limited\" is more precise in the context of government programs with defined durations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in terminology (e.g., use \"labour\" throughout or \"labor\").\n- Use \"Job Retention\" for the government program, as it aligns with the intent of the policy.\n- Use \"wages\" in plural form when referring to general trends.\n- Use \"cyclical response\" for economic terminology.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"a certain degree of support\" is natural and not overly literal.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, with careful attention to consistency and natural phrasing.\n---\nThe labour market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% within the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3), with unemployment rates in hard-hit industries such as retail, accommodation, and food services exceeding 10%. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest level since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to a cyclical response to the rapid deterioration of economic conditions, the labour force participation rate slightly decreased. Total employment numbers (Figure 3) and private-sector job vacancies fell sharply, reflecting further contraction in overall labour demand. Growth in nominal wages and income slowed further. The government introduced the \"Job Retention\" plan, providing employers with time-limited financial support to retain employees, offering the labour market a certain degree of support.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Status\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary's requirement to use \"labour market\" for \"勞工市場.\" However, there are minor differences in the choice of the second term, which refers to the \"狀況\" in the original text. The options used are \"Status,\" \"Conditions,\" \"situation,\" and \"Conditions\" again. \n\"Status\" and \"situation\" are both appropriate, but \"status\" is more commonly used in formal or technical contexts to describe the current state of something, such as a market. \"Conditions\" is also acceptable but may imply a broader set of circumstances or factors affecting the market, which may not be the exact nuance intended by \"狀況.\" \nAmong the translations, \"Figure 3 Labour Market Status\" and \"Figure 3: Labour Market Situation\" are both fluent and natural. However, \"Figure 3 Labour Market Status\" is slightly more concise and formal, which aligns well with the likely context of the original text, which appears to be part of a report or academic paper.\nTherefore, the best translation would be \"Figure 3 Labour Market Status,\" as it is concise, grammatically correct, and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nWith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. Following large-scale support measures introduced by central banks and governments around the world, the stock market slightly recovered in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). Due to breakthroughs in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the stock market regained some upward momentum toward the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points by year-end, recording a 3.4% annual decline. Benefiting from the secondary listings of mainland Chinese companies in Hong Kong, the total fundraising from initial public offerings in Hong Kong in 2020 amounted to approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices\nThe original text is \"圖 4 資產價格,\" which translates to \"Figure 4 Asset Prices.\" The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, though there are minor variations in punctuation and pluralization.\nTranslation 1, 2, 5: \"Figure 4 Asset Prices\" – These are correct and consistent with standard English conventions for labeling figures in technical or academic contexts. The use of \"Prices\" in plural is appropriate since \"資產價格\" refers to a range or set of prices.\nTranslation 3 and 6: \"Figure 4 Asset Price\" – These are incorrect because \"資產價格\" is plural in meaning, referring to multiple prices or the general concept of asset pricing, not a single price. Using \"Price\" in singular form misrepresents the original meaning.\nTranslation 4: \"Figure 4: Asset Prices\" – This is also correct, with the colon being a common stylistic choice in some academic or technical writing. However, the absence of a colon in the other translations suggests that it may not be necessary unless specified by a style guide.\nThe best translation should be concise, clear, and consistent with standard labeling conventions. Since no specific style guide is provided, the most neutral and widely accepted format is \"Figure 4 Asset Prices.\" This avoids unnecessary punctuation and correctly uses the plural form.\n\n# Property Market\n\nSupported in part by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained largely stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared to the previous year. However, due to reduced household incomes, housing affordability tightened further. On the other hand, the non-residential property market weakened further, with property prices declining by varying degrees and transaction volumes reaching a low. Affected by the economic downturn and rising vacancy rates, rents for office buildings and retail spaces fell significantly. Given that the non-residential property market had already experienced significant adjustments since 2019 and was expected to face continued pressure, along with other factors such as the economic outlook and external environment, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also revoked the Doubled Ad Valorem Stamp Duty on the purchase of non-residential properties, a demand management measure, in November.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"國際組織\" as \"international organisations\" or \"international bodies,\" \"實質本地生產總值\" as \"real GDP,\" \"新冠病毒\" as \"COVID-19,\" and \"私營機構\" as \"private-sector.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, clarity, and flow that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure and flow of the sentences are largely natural and grammatically correct.\n- The translations maintain the nuance of uncertainty and the conditional nature of the economic forecasts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"return to positive growth in 2021 (full year)\" or \"return to positive growth in 2021 (annual total),\" which can be more naturally phrased as \"return to positive growth for the full year of 2021.\"\n- The phrase \"the development of the epidemic\" is slightly less common than \"the development of the pandemic.\"\n- Some translations use \"real local GDP\" instead of \"real GDP,\" which is redundant and unnecessary.\n- The phrase \"a considerable degree of challenges\" is slightly awkward and can be simplified to \"considerable challenges.\"\n- The use of \"merchandise and service exports\" in one translation is less common than \"goods and services exports.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural phrasing for time references, such as \"for the full year of 2021.\"\n- Use \"pandemic\" instead of \"epidemic\" for consistency with global terminology.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"real GDP\" without the word \"local.\"\n- Simplify expressions like \"considerable challenges\" to enhance fluency.\n- Use \"goods and services exports\" as it is more standard in economic contexts.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nVaccination against COVID-19 is expected to restore economic activity to normal, with Hong Kong's economy projected to return to positive growth for the full year of 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, widespread vaccination will take time, so the local economy will still face considerable challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, it is expected that the mainland economy will further strengthen and provide support for Hong Kong's exports of goods and services. However, the pace of recovery in other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts that the real GDP growth rate in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, aligning with the average of 4.4% from the latest growth forecasts by international organisations and private-sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nGiven the continued challenges in the global and local economic situation, inflationary pressure is expected to remain mild in 2021. Furthermore, the transmission effect of recent declines in private residential rents will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts the headline inflation rate for 2021 to be 1.5%, while the government expects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the continued challenges in the economic outlook during the early part of 2021, combined with private-sector analysts' expectations that the unemployment rate for the entire year of 2021 will remain at a relatively high level of around 5.9%, the labour market is expected to remain under pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and the use of appropriate terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"sound financial conditions\" is slightly awkward; \"sound financial condition\" is more natural. Also, \"asset quality slightly deteriorated, but remained at a stable level\" is grammatically correct but could be smoother.\n2. **Second junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. However, \"Liquidity\" is capitalized unnecessarily. Also, \"deposits increased\" is more natural than \"deposit funds increased.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very fluent and uses \"resilient\" instead of \"stable,\" which is a stronger and more appropriate term in the context of a financial sector facing challenges. However, \"deposit funding increased\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. However, \"resilient level\" at the end is not a standard phrase; \"stable level\" is more appropriate. Also, \"capital and liquidity positions\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is one of the best translations. It uses \"robust\" to describe the banking sector, which is a strong and appropriate term. The sentence structure is fluent, and the use of \"while\" to introduce the slight deterioration in asset quality is natural and clear.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. However, \"sound financial conditions of banks\" is slightly awkward; \"sound financial conditions\" is more natural. Also, \"capital and liquidity positions\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"banking sector\" should be used consistently, as it is the dictionary term for \"銀行體系.\"\n- \"Resilient\" or \"robust\" is a stronger and more appropriate term than \"stable\" when describing the banking sector's performance in the face of challenges.\n- \"Balance sheets\" should be used in the plural form, as it is the dictionary term.\n- \"Asset quality\" should be used as the dictionary term.\n- \"Liquidity\" should not be capitalized unless it is part of a proper noun.\n- The phrase \"slightly deteriorated, but remained at a stable level\" is grammatically correct but could be more concise and natural.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained robust in 2020, with banks maintaining sound financial conditions. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, banking balance sheets continued to expand, with increased deposit funds. The banking sector maintained ample capital and liquidity, and while asset quality slightly deteriorated, it remained at a stable level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in phrasing, structure, and word choice. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"balance sheets\" (plural), which is appropriate given the context of a sector-wide expansion. The use of \"credit growth\" is consistent with the dictionary, and the structure is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"balance sheet\" (singular), which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"balance sheets\" when referring to the entire banking sector. The use of \"loan growth\" instead of \"credit growth\" is a minor deviation from the dictionary, though both are acceptable in context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with the exception of using \"lending\" instead of \"loans\" in some instances. While \"lending\" is a valid synonym, \"loans\" is more precise in the context of financial statistics.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"credit growth\" and \"balance sheets\" correctly. The phrase \"down from an increase of 6.7%\" is slightly more concise than \"compared to a growth rate of 6.7%,\" but both are acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"balance sheet\" (singular), which is slightly less precise than \"balance sheets\" in this context. The use of \"among which\" is slightly awkward compared to \"among these\" or \"of which.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"balance sheets\" (plural), which is appropriate. The structure is clear, and the use of \"of which\" is slightly more formal than \"among which\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Balance sheets\" (plural) is more appropriate when referring to the entire banking sector.\n- \"Credit growth\" is more precise than \"loan growth\" in the context of financial statistics.\n- \"Loans\" is more precise than \"lending\" when referring to specific financial instruments.\n- \"Among these\" or \"of which\" is more natural than \"among which\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"compared to a growth of 7.4%\" is slightly more natural than \"compared to a 7.4% growth recorded in 2019.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe banking sector’s balance sheets expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic downturn, credit growth slowed to 1.2% for the year, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019; among these, loans used in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, while loans used outside Hong Kong rose slightly by 0.1%, and trade finance decreased by 6.2%. Mainland-related lending fell slightly by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% growth recorded in 2019.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to an increase of 2.9% in 2019. As the growth in total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector\n\n# Capital adequacy\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系,\" \"Tier 1 capital ratio\" for \"一級資本比率,\" and \"authorized institutions\" (or its abbreviations) for \"認可機構.\" However, there are subtle differences in the use of terms like \"total capital ratio\" versus \"comprehensive total capital ratio\" or \"consolidated total capital ratio,\" which may reflect varying interpretations of the original Chinese term \"綜合總資本比率.\"\nThe term \"綜合總資本比率\" is best translated as \"comprehensive total capital ratio\" or \"consolidated total capital ratio,\" both of which are acceptable in financial contexts. However, \"comprehensive total capital ratio\" may be more commonly used in regulatory or banking reports, making it a slightly more natural choice.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically sound. However, some translations use slightly more formal or precise language, such as \"sound\" in the fourth translation, which is a valid synonym for \"robust\" or \"stable\" in this context.\nThe phrase \"at the end of 2020\" is used consistently across translations, which is appropriate. However, the use of \"as of the end of 2020\" in the fourth translation is also acceptable and slightly more formal.\nThe use of \"AIs\" as an abbreviation for \"authorized institutions\" is appropriate in the fourth and fifth translations, but it may be less clear to a general audience. Since the original text does not use an abbreviation, it may be preferable to use the full term \"authorized institutions\" unless the context clearly supports the use of an abbreviation.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"comprehensive total capital ratio\" for \"綜合總資本比率,\" \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構,\" and \"robust\" or \"sound\" for \"穩健.\" It would also maintain a consistent and formal tone, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations unless they are well-established in the context.\nThe final translation should be fluent, accurate, and natural in English, while respecting the original meaning and the dictionary constraints.\nThe banking sector's capital position remained robust in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. By the end of 2020, the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions remained stable compared to the end of 2019, at 20.7%. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Figure 6).\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward financial statement comparing the Basel III leverage ratio at the end of 2020 to that of 2019, emphasizing its stability and its significant distance from the statutory minimum requirement. All junior translators have correctly used the dictionary terms: \"Basel III leverage ratio\" and \"statutory minimum requirement.\" This is a strong point across all translations.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect the tone and precision of the message.\nThe first junior translator uses \"significantly higher than the 3% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 7).\" This is correct, but placing the percentage immediately after \"higher than\" may slightly disrupt the flow.\nThe second junior translator uses \"well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\" \"Well above\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in financial contexts, and the placement of the percentage after \"requirement\" improves readability.\nThe third and fourth junior translators use \"significantly higher than\" and \"much higher than,\" respectively. Both are acceptable, but \"significantly higher\" is more formal and precise, which is appropriate for a financial report.\nThe fifth junior translator reorders the sentence slightly: \"The Basel III leverage ratio remained stable at 8.2% at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019, which is significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\" This version is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the others, as the phrase \"which is significantly higher\" introduces a dependent clause that may feel less concise.\nThe sixth junior translator uses \"significantly above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\" \"Above\" is a more direct and commonly used term in financial contexts than \"higher than,\" and it is slightly more concise.\nConsidering all these points, the best translation would retain the clarity and precision of the original while using natural, formal financial language. \"Well above\" is a strong and commonly used phrase in such contexts, and placing the percentage after \"requirement\" improves readability. Additionally, the structure should be concise and direct.\nFinal translation:\nThe Basel III leverage ratio at the end of 2020 remained stable compared to the end of 2019, still at 8.2%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text accurately. However, they vary in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but the use of \"Liquidity\" in all caps is inconsistent and unnecessary. Also, \"has the ability to withstand liquidity shocks under stress\" is slightly awkward compared to more natural phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"liquidity position\" and \"capacity to withstand liquidity shocks during stress periods,\" which are natural and precise. The use of \"stood at\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"liquidity situation\" and \"capable of withstanding liquidity shocks during stress periods,\" which are natural. It also includes the acronyms (LCR and LMR) in parentheses, which adds clarity. The use of \"significantly higher\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is similar to the third, but it uses \"Liquidity\" in all caps inconsistently and \"under stress\" is slightly less natural than \"during stress periods.\" The use of \"significantly exceeding\" is good, but the capitalization is inconsistent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"liquidity position\" and \"during periods of stress,\" which are natural. The use of \"well above\" and \"significantly higher\" is appropriate. However, it lacks the acronyms (LCR and LMR) for the ratios, which could be helpful for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"liquidity position\" and \"during stress scenarios,\" which are natural. The use of \"far exceeding\" and \"significantly above\" is appropriate. It also includes the acronyms (LCR and LMR) in parentheses, which adds clarity.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The best version should use natural phrasing such as \"liquidity position\" or \"liquidity situation.\"\n- It should use \"during stress periods\" or \"during stress scenarios\" for clarity and fluency.\n- The acronyms (LCR and LMR) should be included in parentheses for clarity.\n- The use of \"significantly higher\" or \"far exceeding\" is appropriate, but should be consistent.\n- The capitalization of terms like \"Liquidity\" should be avoided unless it is a proper noun or acronym.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the third and sixth junior translators, ensuring natural phrasing, clarity, and consistency in terminology.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector remains robust, capable of withstanding liquidity shocks during stress periods. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for category 1 institutions was 155.1% in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the 100% statutory minimum requirement. The quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio (LMR) for category 2 institutions was 57.9%, also significantly above the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR),\" \"Core Funding Ratio (CFR),\" \"statutory minimum requirement,\" \"category 1 institutions,\" and \"category 2A institutions.\" The structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all versions.\nHowever, there are subtle differences in fluency and style. For instance, the use of \"remain stable\" versus \"remain stable\" is consistent, but the placement of \"as of the end of 2020\" versus \"at the end of 2020\" is a matter of stylistic preference. Similarly, the use of \"significantly exceeding\" versus \"far above\" or \"well above\" conveys slightly different nuances, though all are acceptable.\nThe best translation would maintain clarity, consistency, and natural English phrasing while ensuring that all technical terms are correctly translated and formatted. It should also avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"statutory minimum requirement\" unnecessarily.\nBased on this review, the improved translation would be:\nThe banking sector's funding sources remain stable. As of the end of 2020, category 1 institutions had a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 138.6%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Category 2A institutions had a Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of 139.5%, also significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nThe original Chinese text is a title, likely from a regulatory or financial document, and it is concise. The key term \"認可機構\" must be translated using one of the provided alternatives: \"AIs,\" \"Als,\" or \"authorized institutions.\" Among these, \"authorized institutions\" is the most natural and widely understood in formal English contexts, especially in regulatory or financial documents.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\" – This is accurate and uses \"authorized institutions\" correctly. The term \"designated\" is appropriate for \"指定\" in this context. However, the use of \"Funding Ratio\" with a capital \"R\" may be inconsistent with standard title capitalization, which typically uses title case (e.g., \"Funding Ratio\" or \"Funding ratio\" depending on style).\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 9 specifies the capital ratios of authorized institutions.\" – This is a full sentence rather than a title, which is inappropriate for a figure caption. Additionally, \"capital ratios\" may not be the best match for \"資金比率\" (funding ratio), which is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 9 specifies the funding ratio of authorized institutions\" – Again, this is a full sentence rather than a title. It also omits the term \"designated,\" which is crucial for accurately reflecting the original Chinese.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding ratios of authorized institutions.\" – This is a title, but it omits \"designated\" and uses \"ratios\" in plural, which may not match the singular \"比率\" in the original. Also, \"ratios\" may be less precise than \"ratio\" in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\" – This is the most accurate translation. It includes \"designated,\" uses \"authorized institutions,\" and capitalizes \"Funding Ratio\" appropriately for a title.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Designated Authorized Institutions' Capital Ratio\" – This is close but uses \"capital ratio\" instead of \"funding ratio,\" which may not be the best match for \"資金比率.\" Also, the possessive form \"Institutions'\" is less common in formal titles.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nUnder the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector slightly declined during the year, but remained good by historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. The delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card lending remained low, at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\n\nFigure 11 Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending\nFigure 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending\n\n# Profitability Trends\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all quite accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms as specified, such as \"loan impairment charges,\" \"retail banks,\" \"net interest income,\" \"asset quality,\" \"pre-tax operating profit,\" \"banking sector,\" and \"net interest margin.\" This is a strong point, as it ensures consistency with the required terminology.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct and natural-sounding in English. However, there are slight variations in style and word choice that could be refined for greater precision and clarity. For example:\n- \"Low-interest environment\" vs. \"low interest rate environment\" – the latter is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- \"Put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector\" vs. \"put pressure on the banking sector's profitability\" – both are correct, but the latter is slightly more concise.\n- \"Slight decline\" vs. \"slight deterioration\" – while both are acceptable, \"decline\" is more neutral and commonly used in financial reporting, whereas \"deterioration\" may imply a more severe or negative change.\nThe use of \"coupled with\" in the fifth translation adds a slightly more formal tone, which may be appropriate for a financial report. However, the other translations use \"combined with\" or \"combined with a slight decline,\" which are also acceptable and widely used.\nIn terms of cultural appropriateness, all translations are neutral and professional, suitable for a financial or economic context.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining the phrasing for greater precision and consistency with financial terminology.\n---\nThe low interest rate environment, combined with a slight decline in asset quality, has put pressure on the banking sector's profitability. The overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks fell by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), mainly due to a decrease in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment charges (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nDue to income decline, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banks increased from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12: Performance of Retail Banks\nAll six translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in style and punctuation that affect fluency and readability.\nThe first translation uses a colon after \"Figure 12\" and capitalizes \"Performance\" correctly. It is clear and concise.\nThe second translation omits the colon and capitalizes \"Retail Banks\" as a proper noun, which is not necessary here since it's a general term.\nThe third translation uses \"The performance\" with an article, which is slightly more verbose than necessary for a figure caption.\nThe fourth and fifth translations omit the colon and capitalize \"Retail Banks\" as a proper noun, which is not standard in this context.\nThe sixth translation is identical to the fifth.\nThe most natural and standard format for figure captions in English is to use a colon after the figure number and to capitalize only the first letter of the first word and proper nouns. Based on this reasoning, the best translation is:\nFigure 12: Performance of Retail Banks\n\nFigure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nFigure 14: Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banks\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖

2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖

貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖

聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖

貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

Supported by substantial equity-related inflows, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered multiple times. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, fully demonstrating its strong capacity to withstand shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Base,\" \"Currency Board system\/arrangements,\" \"US dollar reserves,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain the formal tone expected in policy documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the Exchange Fund\" with a lowercase \"e\" in \"Exchange Fund,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" (which should be capitalized as a proper noun).\n- **Translation 2** capitalizes \"Monetary Stability\" and \"Monetary Base\" inconsistently, which may be misleading in a formal context.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the Exchange Fund\" with lowercase \"e,\" similar to Translation 1, and also uses \"the Monetary Base\" with lowercase \"m,\" which is not ideal for a formal document.\n- **Translation 4** correctly capitalizes \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" as per the dictionary, but uses \"matching 100% of the changes\" which is slightly awkward phrasing.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"the Exchange Fund\" with lowercase \"e\" and \"the monetary base\" with lowercase \"m,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preference for \"Monetary Base\" as a capitalized term.\n- **Translation 6** is the most consistent in terms of capitalization and phrasing, but it uses \"ensuring a 100% alignment\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all proper nouns and key terms from the dictionary are consistently capitalized.\n- Use more concise and natural phrasing, such as \"matching changes in the Monetary Base by 100%\" or \"fully aligning with changes in the Monetary Base.\"\n- Avoid unnecessary repetition, such as \"changes in the Monetary Base\" appearing twice in some translations.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and avoids awkward phrasing like \"matching 100% of the changes.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use the dictionary terms correctly, and ensure consistent capitalization and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain Monetary Stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar's exchange value and keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts the Currency Board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by THE EXCHANGE FUND must provide at least 100% support for the Monetary Base; any changes in the Monetary Base must be matched by corresponding increases or decreases in the US dollar reserves, ensuring full alignment with changes in the Monetary Base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation  \n- Aggregate Balance (i.e., clearing account balances held at the HKMA)  \n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"貨幣基礎\" as \"Monetary Base,\" which is the exact term provided in the dictionary. The translations are consistent and accurate in this regard. The phrase \"Table 1\" is also correctly used to denote the table number.\nThe translations are minimal in scope, as the original text is very short, consisting of only a table title. Given the brevity of the original text, there is not much room for variation or elaboration. However, the translations are all correct and fluent in English.\nSince the original text is simply a table title, the best possible translation is to maintain the structure and terminology exactly as provided by the junior translators. There is no need for additional elaboration or rephrasing. Therefore, the most accurate and appropriate translation is:\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Aggregate Balance,\" \"Convertibility Undertakings,\" \"Convertibility Zone,\" and \"interest rate.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key economic concepts are preserved.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Convertibility Undertakings\" consistently but introduces \"Convertibility Undertaking\" in the first sentence, which is inconsistent with the dictionary.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Convertibility Undertakings\" and \"Convertibility Zone\" correctly but uses \"strong side (or weak side)\" instead of \"strong (or weak)\" which is slightly less concise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"CUs\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable but not as formal as \"Convertibility Undertakings.\"\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal, but uses \"Automatic Adjustment Mechanism of interest rates\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism.\"\n- **Translation 5** is very accurate and uses \"strong side (or weak side)\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the ideal, but uses \"at the request of banks\" which is slightly less direct than \"in response to requests from banks.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the full term \"Convertibility Undertakings\" consistently, as it is the most formal and precise term in the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"strong (or weak)\" is more concise and natural than \"strong side (or weak side).\"\n- The phrase \"in response to requests from banks\" is more natural than \"at the request of banks\" or \"upon banks' requests.\"\n- The phrase \"automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism\" is more natural than \"Automatic Adjustment Mechanism of interest rates.\"\n- The use of \"thereby\" and \"thus\" should be balanced to avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling Convertibility Undertakings. When a strong (or weak) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA sells Hong Kong dollars and buys US dollars (or buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars) at a rate of 7.75 HKD per USD (or 7.85 HKD per USD) in response to requests from banks, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nWith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, risk-averse sentiment led global investors to increase their holdings of the U.S. dollar, significantly tightening U.S. dollar liquidity. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by concurrent U.S. dollar interest rates, the tightness in U.S. dollar liquidity caused Hong Kong's monetary conditions to tighten. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve later implemented liquidity programmes, easing some U.S. dollar liquidity pressure, the demand for equity securities and the quarter-end effect kept Hong Kong's monetary conditions relatively tight. Strong demand for the Hong Kong dollar, combined with the positive interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, stimulated carry trade activities, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate toward the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate (Figure 1), which was eventually triggered in April. Subsequently, the flourishing initial public offering activity and the southbound capital flows under the Stock Connects drove equity securities-related capital inflows, keeping the Hong Kong dollar close to 7.75 and leading to multiple triggers of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking throughout 2020. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, with cumulative capital inflows of HKD 383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rates\n\nAggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes increased from HKD 11,330 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 15,266 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). Following the triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking, the HKMA sold a total of HKD 3,835 billion in response to banks' requests. The COVID-19 pandemic caused global macroeconomic volatility, and to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA gradually reduced the issuance of a total of HKD 200 billion in Exchange Fund Bills in late April and early May. Due to the triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduction in Exchange Fund Bills issuance, the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) increased from HKD 543 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 4,575 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes slightly decreased from HKD 10,787 billion to HKD 10,692 billion during the year, reflecting the reduction in Exchange Fund Bills issuance, which offset the usual practice of absorbing interest on outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes through the issuance of new Exchange Fund Bills and Notes. The overall Monetary Base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2020 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Papers\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title is a financial statement caption, likely from a report or document detailing monetary reserves or liabilities. The key terms to be translated are \"總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）\" and \"未償還外匯基金票據及債券.\" According to the dictionary, \"總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）\" should be translated as either \"Aggregate Balance\" or \"before Discount Window,\" and \"未償還外匯基金票據及債券\" must be translated as \"outstanding Exchange Fund papers.\"\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 2 Aggregate Balance before Discount Window and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2020\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The placement of \"in 2020\" at the end is slightly awkward and less formal than placing it after \"Figure 2.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 2 Aggregate Balance before Discount Window and outstanding Exchange Fund papers and bonds\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Attempts to clarify the term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The dictionary specifies \"outstanding Exchange Fund papers,\" not \"papers and bonds.\" This introduces an unnecessary addition not present in the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 2: 2020 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper placement of \"2020,\" and use of parentheses for clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The colon after \"Figure 2\" is more common in formal titles, but not strictly incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, clear and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the year \"2020\" in the title, which is present in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Papers\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper capitalization.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Outstanding\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's part of a title case style, which may not be required here.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 2: 2020 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper placement of \"2020,\" and use of a colon.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"outstanding\" is lowercase, which may be inconsistent with title case conventions depending on the document's style guide.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Include the year \"2020\" as it appears in the original.\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window)\" and \"outstanding Exchange Fund papers.\"\n- Maintain a formal and clear structure, suitable for a financial document.\n- Follow standard title formatting, such as using a colon after \"Figure 2\" and lowercase for non-title words unless required by style.\nBased on these considerations, the most accurate and natural translation is:\n**Figure 2: 2020 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Papers**\n\n# Money Markets\n\nFollowing the Lunar New Year holiday, liquidity demand declined, and Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally fell in February (Figure 3). Entering March, due to U.S. dollar funding pressures, along with local factors such as capital raising related to new share issues and end-of-quarter funding demands, HIBORs temporarily rose. Subsequently, as the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered and the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills decreased, leading to an increase in the Aggregate Balance, the liquidity situation for Hong Kong dollars gradually eased.\n\nIn response to the two reductions in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range in March, as well as reflecting changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) throughout the year, the Base Rate decreased from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at year-end. At the retail front, despite the reduction in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range, banks maintained their Best Lending Rates unchanged. Overall, Hong Kong money markets continued to operate normally. Discount window lending fell from HKD 38.3 billion in 2019 to HKD 9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3 2020 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating strong resilience against shocks. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the stability and effectiveness of the LERS. Throughout the year, amid some baseless rumors questioning the LERS and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly reaffirmed to the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the LERS, emphasizing that the free flow of capital and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published several articles clarifying the fact that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to demonstrate strong resilience against shocks even in adverse conditions. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets and the continued normal use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value reflect the effectiveness of the aforementioned measures in maintaining public confidence in the LERS. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in the External Sector Report 2020 that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, all of which ensure the credibility of the LERS.\n\nA robust banking system plays a critical role in the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Despite the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong banking sector has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels being highly ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system's ability to withstand shocks, the HKMA has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and has maintained regulatory oversight of bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA has provided additional liquidity to the banking sector to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA has established a series of liquidity facilities for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA maintains communication with banks to ensure they can utilize these liquidity facilities during periods of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in global financial markets, the HKMA introduced a temporary US Dollar Liquidity Facility to provide US dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate liquidity strains in the global US dollar interbank money markets.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated as Backing Assets for the Monetary Base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the LERS, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's sound banking sector, provide a strong backing for monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations of the Backing Ratio in 2020\n\n# Other Matters\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 其他事務\". The junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are essentially correct. However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that can be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text suggests that this is a heading or section title. Most of the translations have preserved this symbol, which is appropriate. However, the first, second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"# Other Matters\" with a capital \"M\" in \"Matters,\" which is consistent with standard English heading conventions. The third and fourth translations use lowercase \"other matters,\" which is less formal and may not be ideal for a heading.\nAdditionally, the fourth translation ends with a period, which is unnecessary for a heading. The best approach is to maintain the \"#\" symbol, capitalize the heading appropriately, and avoid unnecessary punctuation.\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate translation is \"# Other Matters,\" which preserves the original formatting, uses proper capitalization, and avoids extraneous punctuation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Currency Board Sub-Committee,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong property market,\" \"cross-border fund flows,\" and \"interbank market.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"meeting records\" or \"minutes\" and \"reports on the operation of the Currency Board system\" is accurate and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** Some translations use \"discussing\" or \"exploring\" instead of \"monitoring and examining,\" which is less precise than the original's \"監察及探討\" (monitor and discuss). \"Examine\" is more aligned with \"探討\" (discuss\/examine) in a formal, official context.\n- **Redundancy and Clarity:** Some translations repeat \"understanding\" unnecessarily, such as \"understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border fund flows, and understanding the interbank market.\" This repetition can be streamlined.\n- **Prepositional Phrases:** Some translations use \"in Hong Kong\" redundantly, such as \"understanding the interbank market in Hong Kong,\" when \"interbank market\" is already understood to be in Hong Kong.\n- **Term Consistency:** The term \"Currency Board system\" is used in some translations, while others use \"Currency Board arrangements.\" The original text uses \"貨幣發行局制度,\" which is best translated as \"Currency Board system\" or \"Currency Board arrangements.\" However, \"Currency Board system\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best translation, we should:\n- Use \"monitoring and examining\" to align with the original's \"監察及探討.\"\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"understanding\" only once if necessary.\n- Use \"Currency Board system\" as the preferred term for \"貨幣發行局制度.\"\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly and consistently.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, as the original is an official document.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2020, the Currency Board Sub-Committee examined topics including scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border fund flows, and the Hong Kong interbank market. Meeting records of the Currency Board Sub-Committee and the HKMA's reports on the operation of the Currency Board system are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) was able to maintain a certain level of research output in 2020. In 2020, HKIMR published a total of 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure, and fintech development. Some of these papers have already been accepted or are currently under review for publication in professional journals. Due to the implementation of social distancing measures and travel restrictions during the pandemic, major activities organized by HKIMR, such as seminars, lectures, and Visiting Research Programmes, had to be postponed. Once public health and travel conditions return to normal, HKIMR will resume these activities.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation (referring to banknotes issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 5, 6, and 7). The total value of government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation was HKD 12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous year (Figures 8 and 9). Among the government-issued currency notes and coins, the total value of 10 Hong Kong dollar banknotes in circulation was HKD 4.6 billion, of which polymer notes accounted for 79%.\n\nFigure 5: Banknotes in Circulation by Note-Issuing Banks as of the End of 2020.\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020.\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Paper Currency and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 9 Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Paper Money and Coins at the End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nFollowing the introduction of new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series banknotes are now in circulation. This series of banknotes features more durable and user-friendly anti-counterfeiting features, which have been well-received by the public and are gradually replacing the older series.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to host seminars to introduce the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA organized eight seminars (including online sessions), enhancing the public's understanding of Hong Kong banknotes and attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank tellers, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, the phrase \"which are stored value facilities\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"enhance students' understanding\" instead of \"raise students' awareness,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"stored value facilities such as Octopus cards or e-wallets,\" which is slightly more natural than the first version.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"allowing the public to exchange coins for cash or to top up stored value facilities such as Octopus cards or e-wallets,\" which is a more natural phrasing. It also uses \"in recognition of\" instead of \"recognizing,\" which is slightly more formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version uses \"continued to be widely welcomed by the public\" instead of \"remained popular with the public,\" which is slightly less common in formal writing. It also uses \"adding value to Octopus cards or e-wallets as stored value facilities,\" which is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with natural phrasing and accurate use of terminology. It uses \"adding value to Octopus cards or e-wallets as stored value facilities\" and \"recognizing its innovative and environmentally friendly approach,\" which are both well-structured.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"allowing citizens to choose to exchange coins for banknotes or use them to top up Octopus cards or e-wallets, which are stored value facilities\" can be improved for clarity and flow.\n- The use of \"stored value facilities\" should be consistent and clearly defined.\n- The phrase \"non-governmental organisations' flag days\" should be used consistently.\n- The term \"Coin Carts\" should be used consistently as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"raise students' awareness\" is slightly less formal than \"enhance students' understanding,\" but both are acceptable.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Coin Collection Programme was launched in October 2014 and has remained popular with the public throughout the year. It is the world's first systematic mobile coin collection programme, featuring two Coin Carts that rotate through all 18 districts across Hong Kong. Each Coin Cart is equipped with two high-speed coin counting machines, allowing citizens to choose between exchanging coins for cash, adding value to Octopus cards or e-wallets (stored value facilities), or depositing funds into the Community Chest donation boxes inside the carts. In addition, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy Coin Carts during non-governmental organisations' flag days to collect coins. The Coin Carts also visit schools to enhance students' understanding of the Coin Collection Programme. Over the past years, the Coin Collection Programme has received numerous local and international awards, recognizing its innovative and environmentally friendly approach.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US

All junior translators have correctly used this term, though there are minor variations in capitalization and punctuation.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations use \"banking stability\" in lowercase, which is acceptable in contexts where it is not the title of a document or section. The second and fourth translations use \"Banking stability\" with a capital \"B,\" which is appropriate if this term is the title of a section or heading. The sixth translation includes the \"#\" symbol, which may be an artifact of formatting and is unnecessary in standard English usage.\nThe best translation would be \"Banking stability\" with a capital \"B,\" assuming this is intended as a heading or title. If it is part of a larger text or sentence, \"banking stability\" in lowercase would be more appropriate. Given the presence of the \"#\" symbol in one of the translations, it is possible that this term is meant to be a heading or section title. Therefore, capitalizing the first letter is the most appropriate choice for clarity and formality.\n\nDespite the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy, the Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2020. Throughout the year, the HKMA closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding flexibly while continuing to focus its regulatory efforts on credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. Given the persistent increase in cyber threats and the rising trend of fintech adoption in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of technology risk management and operational resilience of authorized institutions. The HKMA also closely collaborated with banks and international organisations to facilitate the industry's transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA provides authorized institutions with regulatory flexibilities and guidance to assist banks in maintaining business operations and continuing to serve customers during the pandemic, while ensuring continued protection for investors and consumers. The HKMA, together with relevant authorities, has developed proposed implementation details for the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme and has consulted the industry. The HKMA, in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission, has provided guidance on streamlining sales procedures for family offices and investors with high net worth who are experienced in financial matters. Furthermore, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection in digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nIn combating AML\/CFT, the HKMA has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help authorized institutions more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continues to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of AML\/CFT efforts, including increasing the number of authorized institutions participating in public-private partnership information sharing, as well as supporting the banking sector's adoption of regulatory technology. The HKMA also aligns with international trends in the use of technology and data, launching further initiatives to strengthen its AML\/CFT surveillance capability.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is working closely with the banking sector to optimize supervisory policies and procedures, as well as implement capacity-building initiatives. Hong Kong has made commendable progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing relevant regulatory provisions. The HKMA is also continuing to strive to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including the formulation of new resolution standards and the implementation of rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements, to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking sector. To achieve this objective, it is essential to establish and maintain a resilient financial sector capable of providing the key financial services required by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking sector through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases, through disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations after a crisis, ultimately helping to prevent bank failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure the financial sector is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime for financial institutions, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution regime, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the above tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and consistency that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"off-site reviews,\" \"CAMEL rating assessment,\" \"corporate governance,\" \"risk management,\" \"fintech strategies,\" \"boards of directors,\" \"independent non-executive directors,\" \"external auditors,\" and \"authorized institutions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Risk governance\" vs. \"risk management\":** Some translations use \"risk governance\" (e.g., translations 1, 3, 6), while others use \"risk management\" (e.g., translations 2, 5). The original text uses \"風險管理\" which is best translated as \"risk management.\" \"Risk governance\" is a broader term and not directly supported by the dictionary.\n- **\"Tripartite meetings\" vs. \"trilateral meetings\" vs. \"three-way meetings\":** These are all acceptable, but \"trilateral meetings\" is more commonly used in formal contexts and is more precise.\n- **\"Boards of directors of authorized institutions\" vs. \"boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors\":** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, particularly in the second part of the sentence. The phrase \"committees under the boards of directors\" is correct, but could be more clearly expressed as \"committees under the boards of directors of authorized institutions\" for clarity.\n- **\"Held 30 meetings\" vs. \"held a total of 30 meetings\":** The use of \"a total of\" adds clarity and is more natural in formal writing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"risk management\" consistently, as it is the direct translation of \"風險管理.\"\n- Use \"trilateral meetings\" for consistency and formality.\n- Clarify the phrase \"committees under the boards of directors\" by specifying \"of authorized institutions.\"\n- Use \"a total of\" to emphasize the quantity of meetings.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA conducted a total of 186 off-site reviews in 2020, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL rating assessments, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies of authorized institutions. To continue enhancing the risk management standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held a total of 30 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors of authorized institutions, and held 30 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site examinations, complemented by thematic reviews, to assess areas identified as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 610 on-site examinations and thematic reviews, continuing to focus on credit risk management as one of the main priorities in its reviews and assessments. Another key focus was operational risk and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, specialist teams conducted on-site examinations and thematic reviews of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the HKMA has maintained its regulatory rigor and implemented flexible arrangements to effectively and flexibly fulfill its supervisory responsibilities, including providing regulatory flexibilities in the submission of reports and the conduct of on-site examinations; enhancing data collection to complement on-site examinations, as well as utilizing virtual meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\nThe original phrase \"表 1 監管工作概要\" translates to \"Table 1 Regulatory Work Overview\" or similar variations. The junior translators have provided several acceptable translations, with slight differences in phrasing and punctuation. \nThe first junior translator used \"Summary of Regulatory Work,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common than \"Overview\" in formal contexts. The second and sixth junior translators used \"Overview of Regulatory Work,\" which is a natural and commonly used phrase in English for summarizing or presenting an overview of a subject. The third and fifth junior translators used \"Regulatory Work Overview\" without the preposition \"of,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less formal. The fourth junior translator used \"Table 1: Regulatory Work Overview,\" which is the most standard and formal format for labeling tables in English documents.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and common usage in formal English documents, \"Table 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\" is the most appropriate and natural translation. It follows the standard format for labeling tables and uses \"Overview\" as the preferred term for \"概要\" in this context. Therefore, the best possible translation is \"Table 1: Overview of Regulatory Work.\"\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Loan growth and asset quality\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe original text is a straightforward financial statement, reporting the percentage increase in total loan amounts for two consecutive years and referencing a table that details the growth of different loan categories. All six translations capture the core meaning accurately, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the numerical data and the reference to Table 2.\n- The use of terms like \"loans and advances\" is consistent and appropriate in a financial context.\n- The structure of the sentences is clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different verbs (e.g., \"shows,\" \"lists,\" \"details\") to describe the content of Table 2. While all are acceptable, \"lists\" and \"details\" may imply more specificity than is warranted by the original text.\n- The phrase \"compared to an increase of 6.7%\" and \"compared to a growth rate of 6.7%\" are both correct, but \"increase\" is more direct and consistent with the original wording.\n- The use of \"volume\" in the third translation (\"Loan volume\") is slightly less precise than \"total loan amount,\" which more closely matches the original Chinese.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"total loan amount\" consistently, as it is the most direct translation of the original.\n- Use \"increase\" rather than \"growth rate\" to match the original's phrasing.\n- Use \"shows\" or \"presents\" for the description of Table 2, as it is neutral and accurate.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe total loan amount increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2019. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2 Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nIn 2020, Mainland-related lending decreased slightly by 0.2% to HKD 455.3 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Mainland-related Lending\nThe junior translators have produced several variations of the title \"表 3 內地相關貸款增長,\" with the primary difference being the use of a colon (\":\") and the preposition \"in\" versus \"of.\" All translations correctly use \"Mainland-related lending\" as required by the dictionary, which is a strength. However, the most fluent and grammatically appropriate phrasing is \"Growth of Mainland-related Lending,\" as it follows the standard structure for titles in English, which often use \"of\" to denote the subject of the growth. The use of a colon adds clarity and is appropriate in formal contexts. Therefore, \"Table 3: Growth of Mainland-related Lending\" is the most natural and professional translation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"authorized institutions,\" \"classified loan ratio,\" and \"Mainland-related lending.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data points (e.g., percentages, time references) are accurately translated.\n- The use of terms like \"deteriorated,\" \"rose,\" and \"remained at a healthy\/sound\/robust level\" effectively conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in adjectives:** The adjectives used to describe the \"level\" of the loan ratio vary between \"healthy,\" \"sound,\" \"robust,\" and \"stable.\" While all are acceptable, \"healthy\" and \"sound\" are more commonly used in financial contexts, and \"robust\" may slightly overstate the situation.\n- **\"Within the year\" vs. \"during the year\":** Both are correct, but \"during the year\" is more natural in formal writing.\n- **\"Regarding\" vs. \"In terms of\":** Both are acceptable, but \"Regarding\" is slightly more formal and direct.\n- **\"Far below\" vs. \"significantly lower than\":** \"Far below\" is more concise and commonly used in financial reporting.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"healthy\" or \"sound\" consistently for the loan ratio level.\n- Use \"during the year\" for temporal clarity.\n- Use \"Regarding\" for smoother transitions.\n- Use \"far below\" for conciseness and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing and consistent terminology.\n**Final Translation:**\nAffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the asset quality of authorized institutions has slightly deteriorated. During the year, the classified loan ratio in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90%, remaining at a healthy level, far below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding Mainland-related lending, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% a year ago to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have brought significant challenges to the economy, the HKMA has thoroughly reviewed the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess the trend of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has strengthened its monitoring of large borrowers and industries more susceptible to the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposures at the sectoral- and borrower-levels. The stress test analysis conducted by the HKMA shows that banks are capable of withstanding the economic pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews to examine the credit risk management approaches of authorized institutions across different areas, including Mainland-related lending, interbank lending, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressure\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism in October 2019. This mechanism introduced multiple rounds of relief measures to assist both corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers' financing needs in accordance with prudent risk management principles. The most significant initiative was the \"PPPHS\" plan launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May. Under this plan, all principal repayments for eligible corporate customers could be deferred for six months. The plan was extended for another six months in November and further extended for another six months until the end of October 2021. Approximately 100 banks participated in the plan, covering around 120,000 eligible corporate customers. By the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of corporate loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 740 billion. For individual customers, banks also introduced a residential mortgage \"interest-only payment\" plan, which included mortgages for properties under the Home Ownership Scheme. In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in industries severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan terms, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. By the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage \"interest-only payment\" and other personal emergency loan applications, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 44 billion.\n\n# property mortgage lending\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio,\" \"debt servicing ratio (DSR),\" and \"countercyclical macroprudential measures.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, clarity, and precision that can be refined for maximum clarity and natural English expression.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message and data points.\n- The use of the dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure and flow of the sentences are largely natural and grammatically sound.\n- The translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for a financial or regulatory context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly redundant phrasing, such as \"newly approved residential mortgage loans\" repeated unnecessarily.\n- The term \"debt servicing ratio\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"DSR\" without explanation, which may be confusing for some readers.\n- The phrase \"resilience of the banking sector\" is used in multiple translations, but \"resilience\" could be more precisely paired with \"ability to withstand\" or \"capacity to resist.\"\n- Some translations use \"ratio ceiling\" or \"ratio cap\" without specifying \"debt servicing ratio,\" which could be ambiguous.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"residential mortgage loans\" consistently without unnecessary repetition.\n- Clarify abbreviations like \"DSR\" on first use.\n- Use more precise verbs such as \"enhanced,\" \"strengthened,\" or \"improved\" depending on context.\n- Ensure that all terms are clearly defined or contextualized to avoid ambiguity.\n---\nThe HKMA has introduced several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures since 2009, which have enhanced banks' risk management and strengthened the banking sector's ability to withstand a sudden reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% in September 2009 before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced. The average LTV ratio for new residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, mainly due to an increase in the proportion of loans involving mortgage insurance, which generally have higher LTV ratios. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) for new mortgages also remained at a low level, at 37% in December, compared to 41% when the DSR ceiling was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the six translations provided, each has strengths and weaknesses in terms of fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary terms. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a positive point. However, there are variations in phrasing and structure that affect clarity and naturalness in English.\nTranslation 1 is clear and grammatically sound, but it uses \"transaction volume\" instead of \"transaction volumes\" and \"economic conditions\" instead of \"economic fundamentals,\" which may not be the most precise terms in this context.\nTranslation 2 is concise and uses \"economic outlook\" and \"increasing\" instead of \"raising,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable. However, it combines two actions in one sentence, which may reduce clarity.\nTranslation 3 is well-structured and uses \"economic climate\" and \"raising\" appropriately. However, it uses \"these loans\" instead of \"such loans,\" which is slightly less precise in formal writing.\nTranslation 4 is very close to the ideal version, using \"economic fundamentals\" and \"external conditions,\" which are more precise terms. It also uses \"raising\" and \"increased\" consistently, and the structure is clear and natural.\nTranslation 5 is similar to Translation 4 but uses \"easing\" instead of \"relaxed\" and \"increasing\" instead of \"raising,\" which is slightly less consistent in verb usage.\nTranslation 6 is very strong, using \"economic fundamentals\" and \"external environments\" accurately. It also uses \"ceiling\" instead of \"cap,\" which is a synonym but slightly less common in financial contexts. It also uses \"eased its\" which is slightly more formal and precise.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of these versions, using precise terminology, clear structure, and natural English phrasing.\nHere is the improved translation:\nTaking into account the price trends and trading volumes of nonresidential properties, as well as economic fundamentals and external conditions, the HKMA relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties in August, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps for such loans by 10 percentage points. The cap for general cases was increased from 40% to 50%.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and Debt Servicing Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the HKMA implemented a series of measures to minimize the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to safeguard the health of employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. Additionally, the HKMA urged authorized institutions to enhance communication with employees and customers, prepare for the possibility of confirmed cases within their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more severe but potentially occurring risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and urged authorized institutions to remain vigilant, regularly reviewing their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments in the pandemic and government social distancing measures.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review of the translations, the overall quality is high, with all translations accurately reflecting the content of the original text and adhering to the dictionary terms. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, precision, and clarity that can be refined for a more polished and natural English rendition.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"CFI 2.0,\" \"C-RAF,\" \"HKAB,\" and \"Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved accurately.\n- The use of terms like \"user-friendly\" and \"enhance\" is appropriate and natural in context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"incorporating the latest international sound practices\" (Translation 4), which is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"incorporating the latest international best practices.\"\n- The phrase \"taking into account the latest practices in overseas cyber risk management\" (Translation 6) is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n- The use of \"jurisdictions\" in Translation 3 is technically correct but less common in this context than \"regions.\"\n- Some translations use \"recommendations\" when \"proposals\" might be more precise, depending on the context of the HKMA's actions.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"best practices\" instead of \"sound practices\" for consistency and fluency.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"in line with\" is used consistently when referring to international standards.\n- Use \"regions\" rather than \"jurisdictions\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Maintain a consistent tone and avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative\" unnecessarily.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nFollowing a comprehensive review of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) and extensive industry consultations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched CFI 2.0 in November to further enhance the initiative in line with the latest international practices in cyber risk management. The Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF) under CFI 2.0 now incorporates the latest international best practices for cyber incident response and recovery. Regarding the Professional Development Programme under the CFI, the scope of the qualification recognition list has been expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas regions. The HKMA also proposed several recommendations to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to make the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform more user-friendly. CFI 2.0 took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nAfter reviewing the six translations, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" \"gamification,\" \"SMEs,\" \"banking licence,\" \"virtual banks,\" and \"big data analytics.\"\n- The structure and meaning of the original text are generally well-preserved across all translations.\n- The use of \"innovative technology\" or \"innovative technologies\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The translations effectively convey the purpose of virtual banks and the benefits of gamification in customer engagement.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"SMEs loans\" instead of \"SME loan credit assessments,\" which is slightly awkward and less precise.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"fixed deposit\" instead of \"定期存款,\" which is technically correct but \"fixed deposit\" is more commonly used in English financial contexts.\n- **Translation 3** and **4** are very similar and both use \"fixed deposits,\" which is acceptable but \"定期存款\" could also be translated as \"term deposits.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"savings accounts\" instead of \"定期存款,\" which is a misinterpretation of the term. \"定期存款\" refers to \"term deposits,\" not \"savings accounts.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"piloting\" instead of \"trials,\" which is a more precise term in regulatory contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"SME loan credit assessments\" for clarity and precision.\n- Use \"term deposits\" instead of \"fixed deposits\" or \"savings accounts\" to accurately reflect \"定期存款.\"\n- Use \"piloting\" instead of \"trials\" for a more formal and regulatory tone.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"innovative technology\" or \"innovative technologies\" based on context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nAfter undergoing rigorous testing and piloting within the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, all eight virtual banks that received banking licences in 2019 have commenced operations within the year. Virtual banks leverage innovative technology to provide new customer experiences, such as using big data analytics for SME loan credit assessments to expedite the loan approval process. To strengthen customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks have incorporated gamification into their services, such as term deposits and reward programs.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"interbank market,\" \"banking sector,\" \"liquidity facilities,\" \"temporary US dollar liquidity facility,\" \"liquidity buffers,\" \"regulatory framework,\" and \"authorized institutions\" (with variations like \"AIs\" used in one translation). However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater clarity, fluency, and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Accurate conveyance of the main message: the HKMA introduced measures to ensure the smooth operation of the interbank market and banking sector during the pandemic.\n- Proper use of tenses and grammatical structures.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic,\" which is less commonly used in formal or official English contexts.\n- The use of \"drills\" versus \"exercises\" is interchangeable, but \"exercises\" is more commonly used in regulatory or institutional contexts.\n- The phrase \"reiterating that authorized institutions can flexibly utilize liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework\" is slightly awkward in some translations; a smoother phrasing would be \"reiterating the flexibility for authorized institutions to use liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework.\"\n- Some translations use \"apply these measures\" or \"deploy these measures,\" which are acceptable, but \"utilize these measures\" is more standard in regulatory contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and formality of the original text, use \"pandemic\" instead of \"epidemic,\" and ensure that the phrasing is natural and idiomatic in English.\nFinal translation:\nIn April, the HKMA introduced a series of measures to ensure the smooth operation of the interbank market and the banking sector during the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the HKMA liquidity facilities and introducing a temporary US dollar liquidity facility, as well as reiterating the flexibility for authorized institutions to use liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted exercises with authorized institutions to ensure they are prepared to utilize these measures when needed.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

The first, second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"International Financial Centre\" with capitalization, which is acceptable but not strictly necessary unless it is a proper noun or title. The third translation uses lowercase, which is more natural in running text. The fifth translation, \"The Status of Hong Kong's International Financial Centre,\" is grammatically correct but less concise and slightly awkward in phrasing.\nThe use of the hashtag (#) in translations 2 and 6 is unnecessary unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform. The original Chinese text does not include a hashtag, so it should be omitted in the final translation.\nThe term \"國際金融中心\" is correctly translated in all cases as \"International Financial Centre\" or \"international financial centre.\" However, the most natural and commonly used form in English is \"international financial centre\" with lowercase unless it is part of a formal title.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and consistency with standard English usage, the best translation would be \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status.\" This version is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the most natural form of the term. It also avoids unnecessary capitalization and formatting.\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial centre. This year, the HKMA implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the Faster Payment System saw a sharp increase.\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial centre. This year, the HKMA implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the Faster Payment System saw a sharp increase.\n\nHong Kong is strategically located at the forefront of China's financial market opening-up, enabling it to fully capitalize on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class market infrastructure and initiatives such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, and Bond Connect, Hong Kong serves not only as a highly favored fundraising platform for mainland enterprises but also as a gateway for international investors to access China's rapidly growing market. This year has seen significant progress in promoting financial cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents' access to financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and sustainable finance. The HKMA is also intensifying its market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. On a global level, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, fully highlighting Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in relevant international initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as an Asian fintech hub, the HKMA continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment industries. Key developments this year include:  \n- Promoting wider adoption of the Faster Payment System;  \n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement Open APIs;  \n- Connecting the trade finance platform \"eTradeConnect\" with the People’s Bank of China's trade finance blockchain platform to promote the digitization of trade finance;  \n- Researching the application of Central Bank Digital Currency in cross-border payments;  \n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Commercial Data Interchange\" and researching alternative credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access financing;  \n- Announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a larger and more diverse Regtech ecosystem to further promote the application of regulatory technology;  \n- Strengthening talent development; and  \n- Advancing cross-border fintech collaboration.\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the collaborative role of the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in promoting certain measures. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing: \"works closely with HKMA's banking departments to play a key role\" is a bit redundant. It also uses \"HKMA\" twice, which could be streamlined.\n**Translation 2** is concise and clear, but it omits the possessive form \"HKMA's\" before \"banking departments,\" which may slightly weaken the clarity of the relationship between the FFO and the departments.\n**Translation 3** uses \"its\" to refer to HKMA, which is acceptable, but the phrase \"are working together\" implies an ongoing action, which may or may not align with the original intent depending on the context.\n**Translation 4** uses the past tense \"played,\" which may not be appropriate if the action is ongoing or current.\n**Translation 5** is the most comprehensive and natural, providing a full name for HKMA (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\") and using \"collaborates\" to convey a more formal and professional tone. It also maintains clarity and grammatical correctness.\n**Translation 6** is also well-structured, but the use of \"has played\" suggests a completed action, which may not be the intended nuance.\nThe best approach would be to combine the strengths of these translations: use the full name of HKMA for clarity, maintain a present tense to indicate ongoing collaboration, and ensure that the relationship between the FFO and the banking departments is clearly expressed.\nThe final translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and accurately reflect the original meaning and nuance.\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) collaborates with the banking departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to play a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include onshore securities from mainland China or increase their weightings, inflows into renminbi assets continue to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in encouraging international investors to increase their allocation to renminbi assets, thanks to its connectivity with mainland capital markets through the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect.\" In 2020, the average daily trading volume of \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching approximately 19.3 billion renminbi. To improve the operation of \"Bond Connect,\" the HKMA introduced new measures, including the introduction of a special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours, and new arrangements that provide investors with more flexibility in choosing banks for currency conversion and foreign exchange hedging. Following the success of the \"Northbound Bond Connect,\" the HKMA formed a working group with the PBoC to study the framework for the \"Southbound Bond Connect.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" \"PBoC,\" \"HKMA,\" \"offshore renminbi business hub,\" and \"renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points—such as the implementation of Wealth Management Connect and the performance of the RTGS system—are well conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain a formal tone suitable for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"financial support measures\" while others use \"financial arrangements\" or \"financial infrastructure.\" While all are acceptable, \"financial arrangements\" is more precise in the context of regulatory and policy measures.\n- **\"Domestic authorities\" vs. \"mainland authorities\":** The term \"domestic authorities\" is less precise and may be confusing in the context of Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China. \"Mainland authorities\" is more accurate and consistent with the original text.\n- **\"Strive to enhance\" vs. \"continue to work diligently to enhance\":** While both are grammatically correct, \"continue to strengthen\" is more concise and natural in formal writing.\n- **\"RMB 120 billion\" vs. \"RMB 1.2 trillion\":** The original text states \"1.2萬億元人民幣,\" which is 120 billion yuan, not 1.2 trillion. Some translations incorrectly use \"1.2 trillion,\" which is a significant error in numerical interpretation.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"financial arrangements\" as it is more precise in the context of policy and regulatory measures.\n- Use \"mainland authorities\" consistently to avoid confusion.\n- Use \"continue to strengthen\" for a more natural and concise expression.\n- Ensure the correct numerical interpretation of \"1.2萬億元人民幣\" as \"RMB 120 billion.\"\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, consistent with the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen financial arrangements between Hong Kong and mainland cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have announced a series of policy measures to support financial development within the region. In June, the PBoC, HKMA, and the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) jointly announced the decision to implement cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect. The HKMA has been working closely with mainland and local authorities, as well as the industry, to formulate detailed implementation rules. The HKMA is also maintaining communication with mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand the policy space for Hong Kong banks to broaden the scope of their cross-border business. Throughout the year, Hong Kong continued to maintain its position as an offshore renminbi business hub. The average daily transaction volume of Hong Kong’s renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of RMB 120 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are variations in fluency, grammar, and word choice that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"green and sustainable finance hub,\" \"market outreach,\" and \"overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message of the HKMA's efforts is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"enhance competitiveness,\" \"favorable tax and regulatory environment,\" and \"financial services\" is appropriate and consistent with the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"funds to establish locally\" (e.g., in Translation 3), which is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrasing should be \"for funds to establish themselves locally\" or \"for funds to establish operations locally.\"\n- **Word Choice:** Some translations use \"devoting significant efforts\" or \"investing significant effort,\" which are both acceptable, but \"devoting significant efforts\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Consistency in Tense and Voice:** Some translations use \"is working closely\" while others use \"closely collaborates,\" which is less active and slightly less direct.\n- **Redundancy and Flow:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"The HKMA is also... The HKMA is also...\" which can be streamlined for better flow.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use active voice where possible to enhance clarity and professionalism.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness, particularly in phrasing related to \"establishing operations locally.\"\n- Maintain consistent verb tenses and avoid redundancy.\n- Choose the most natural and commonly used phrasing in formal English, such as \"devoting significant efforts\" over \"investing significant effort.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining grammar, flow, and word choice for a polished, professional tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s fund business, the HKMA is working closely with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish operations locally. The HKMA is also devoting significant efforts to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA is intensifying its market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nIn the central banking community, the HKMA plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Working Group on Financial Markets under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA also serves as co-chair of the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and leads a group examining regulatory issues related to benchmark transition.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"financial infrastructure,\" \"RTGS,\" \"CMU,\" \"HKTR,\" \"Bond Connect,\" and \"Northbound Bond Connect.\"\n- Most translations accurately reflect the key data: 100% system availability in 2020, exceeding the 99.95% target.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** incorrectly refers to \"Debt Securities Central Settlement System\" instead of \"Central Moneymarkets Unit\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- **Translation 2** repeats \"Bond Connect\" twice in the phrase \"Bond Connect Northbound Bond Connect,\" which is redundant and awkward.\n- **Translation 3** is the most fluent and accurate, using \"Central Moneymarkets Unit\" correctly and clarifying \"Northbound Bond Connect transactions under the Bond Connect program.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"C\" and \"Mainland\" with a capital \"M,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase options.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"International financial centre\" with a lowercase \"i\" and \"on the mainland,\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"in mainland China.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version but uses \"CMU system\" redundantly and could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the exact dictionary terms, avoid redundancy, and maintain a natural, professional tone.\n- The phrase \"Northbound Bond Connect\" should not be repeated unnecessarily.\n- \"Central Moneymarkets Unit\" should be used consistently as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"on behalf of\" is more natural than \"for\" in this context.\n- \"Mainland China\" is more standard than \"the Mainland\" or \"on the mainland.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for its status as an international financial centre. In 2020, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU continues to facilitate the settlement of Northbound Bond Connect transactions and holds mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe original text discusses the continued growth of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in 2020, highlighting the increase in registrations, the tripling of transaction volume compared to 2019, and the factors contributing to this growth, such as government acceptance and merchant adoption.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"FPS\" consistently. However, it incorrectly states that the transaction volume \"doubled\" when the original text says \"上升兩倍\" (increased by two times), which implies a tripling (original + 2x). This is a critical error in numerical interpretation.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Faster Payment System\" consistently and correctly interprets \"上升兩倍\" as \"increasing by two times.\" However, it uses \"transaction amount\" instead of \"transaction volume,\" which is not an exact match for the dictionary term \"交易量.\" Also, the phrase \"the adoption by more merchants\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and correctly interprets \"上升兩倍\" as \"increasing by two times.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, with only minor issues in phrasing, such as \"the main reasons for the significant growth in transaction value.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly interprets \"上升兩倍\" as \"increasing threefold,\" which is the most accurate interpretation of the phrase. However, it uses \"transaction value\" instead of \"transaction volume,\" which is not the dictionary-matched term. This is a minor but important deviation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"FPS\" consistently and correctly interprets \"上升兩倍\" as \"rising two times.\" However, it uses \"transaction value\" instead of \"transaction volume,\" and the phrase \"apart from the steady growth in person-to-person payments\" is slightly less natural than \"in addition to.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Faster Payment System\" and correctly interprets \"上升兩倍\" as \"increasing by two times.\" It uses \"transaction value\" instead of \"transaction volume,\" and \"peer-to-peer\" is a less common term than \"person-to-person\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS\" consistently, as per the dictionary.\n- Correctly interpret \"上升兩倍\" as \"increasing by two times\" or \"tripled.\"\n- Use \"transaction volume\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use natural, fluent English with appropriate phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe usage of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. By the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded, with the annual transaction volume increasing by two times compared to 2019. The government's acceptance of FPS for payments and the increased adoption by more merchants are the main reasons for the significant growth in transaction volume, in addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments via FPS.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designates and supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 stored value facility (SVF) licensees.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as Asia's Fintech Hub\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater fluency and impact.\nThe first translation, \"Hong Kong's Position as the Asian Fintech Hub,\" uses \"Position\" and \"the Asian Fintech Hub,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less natural than alternatives. \"Position\" is more formal and less commonly used in this context compared to \"Status.\"\nThe second translation, \"Hong Kong’s position as an Asian fintech hub,\" is grammatically correct and uses \"position\" and \"an Asian fintech hub.\" However, \"position\" is still less idiomatic than \"status\" in this context, and the use of \"an\" before \"Asian fintech hub\" is unnecessary since \"fintech hub\" is a singular, countable noun.\nThe third translation, \"# Hong Kong's Status as Asia's Fintech Hub,\" is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"Status\" and \"Asia's Fintech Hub,\" which are both natural and idiomatic. However, the use of the hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform.\nThe fourth translation, \"Hong Kong's status as an Asian fintech hub,\" is very similar to the third but uses \"an Asian fintech hub\" instead of \"Asia's Fintech Hub.\" While grammatically correct, \"an Asian fintech hub\" is slightly less precise than \"Asia's Fintech Hub,\" which emphasizes Hong Kong's role within Asia more clearly.\nThe fifth translation, \"# Hong Kong's Position as Asia's Fintech Hub,\" is similar to the third but uses \"Position\" instead of \"Status.\" As noted earlier, \"Status\" is more natural in this context.\nThe sixth translation, \"Hong Kong's position as a fintech hub in Asia,\" is grammatically correct but uses \"position\" and \"a fintech hub in Asia,\" which is slightly less concise and impactful than \"Asia's Fintech Hub.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"Status\" to convey the significance of Hong Kong's role, and \"Asia's Fintech Hub\" to emphasize its position within the region. The hashtag \"#\" is not necessary unless the text is intended for a specific platform, so it should be omitted for a more formal and natural translation.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nSince the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value facilities operators have joined, with 5 additional banks and 1 stored value facility operator joining in 2020. FPS usage has also steadily increased. As of December 31, FPS had recorded 6.9 million registrations (Figure 1). To facilitate the public in receiving payments from institutions, FPS introduced the use of Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers starting December 6. Within less than one month of introducing this feature, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new feature is not intended for person-to-person transfers, but is only for institutions to make payments to recipients whose Hong Kong Identity Card numbers are known (e.g., salary payments). Since each citizen's Hong Kong Identity Card number is unique, using the Hong Kong Identity Card number as an account identifier allows citizens to accurately receive payments even without providing their bank account numbers.\n\nFigure 1: Number of Faster Payment System Account Registrations\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are some nuances and stylistic considerations that can be improved upon.\nThe first translation, \"Figure 1: Number of FPS Account Registrations,\" is concise and uses the acronym FPS, which is appropriate in contexts where the acronym is well-established. However, it may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with FPS.\nThe second translation, \"Figure 1 FPS Account Registration Numbers,\" is slightly more informal due to the placement of \"FPS\" without a colon and the use of \"Numbers\" instead of \"Number.\" It also lacks the colon after \"Figure 1,\" which is standard in such captions.\nThe third and fourth translations are identical and use the full term \"Faster Payment System\" instead of the acronym. This is more verbose but may be preferable in formal or introductory contexts where clarity is prioritized over brevity.\nThe fifth translation, \"Figure 1: Number of Faster Payment System Account Registrations,\" is the most comprehensive and grammatically correct. It uses the full term, includes the colon after \"Figure 1,\" and uses \"Number\" in the singular form, which is appropriate when referring to a count.\nThe sixth translation, \"Figure 1 FPS account registration numbers,\" is the least formal and lacks the colon after \"Figure 1.\" It also uses \"numbers\" in the plural form, which is less precise when referring to a singular count.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be one that balances clarity, formality, and precision. Using the full term \"Faster Payment System\" ensures that all readers understand the reference, while maintaining the standard format with a colon after \"Figure 1\" and using the singular form \"Number\" for a count. Therefore, the most improved translation would be:\n\"Figure 1: Number of Faster Payment System Account Registrations\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in vocabulary, phrasing, and numerical accuracy. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"交易量\" as \"transaction volume,\" \"新冠病毒疫情\" as \"COVID-19 pandemic\" or \"COVID-19,\" and \"轉數快\" as \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS.\"\n- The structure and flow of the sentences are largely consistent with the original Chinese, and the translations maintain the key data points and comparisons.\n- The use of terms like \"person-to-person payments,\" \"bill payments,\" and \"commercial payments\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical accuracy:** The fourth junior translator incorrectly states \"HKD 52 billion\" and \"RMB 950 million\" instead of \"HK$5.2 billion\" and \"RMB 95 million.\" This is a critical error that needs correction.\n- **Redundancy and phrasing:** Some translations use redundant phrases, such as \"gradually expanding to\" or \"gradually extending to,\" which can be simplified for better fluency.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"FPS\" while others use \"Faster Payment System\" inconsistently. It is better to use one term consistently for clarity.\n- **Tense and phrasing:** The phrase \"which has evolved from initially being mainly used for...\" in the first translation is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be preferable.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correct the numerical error in the fourth translation.\n- Use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" consistently.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, avoiding redundancy.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in the comparison of transaction volumes.\n- Maintain the structure and flow of the original text while ensuring natural English expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have brought new momentum to the use of electronic payment services. The transaction volume of the Faster Payment System (FPS) grew particularly rapidly this year (Figure 2), reaching an average of 505,000 daily instant transactions in December 2020 (involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million), which is three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, and ten times the volume in the first month of FPS launch in October 2018. The increased use of FPS has also benefited from the gradual expansion of its application scope, moving from primarily person-to-person payments to include bill payments (including government bills), retail, and commercial payments.\n\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Real-Time Payments\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"banking sector,\" \"e-wallets,\" and \"FPS\" (Faster Payment System).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (e.g., the number of transactions, the timeline, and the services offered) is accurately conveyed.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"government rent\" which is not a standard term in the context of government bills. It should be \"land rent\" or \"rates and land rent.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"provide convenience for citizens\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"provide convenience to the public\" or \"facilitate citizens' transactions.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"facilitate citizens' transactions,\" which is slightly more natural than \"provide convenience for citizens.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"property tax and land rent\" which is more precise than \"rates and land rent,\" though \"rates\" is a commonly used term in Hong Kong.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly states \"HKD 22 billion\" instead of \"HK$2.2 billion,\" which is a significant numerical error.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"HKD 2.2 billion\" correctly and includes \"currently\" in \"currently exploring,\" which adds clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"FPS\" consistently, as it is the more commonly used term in the context of the Faster Payment System.\n- The term \"rates\" is appropriate in the context of Hong Kong government charges and should be retained.\n- The phrase \"provide convenience to the public\" is more natural than \"provide convenience for citizens.\"\n- The numerical value \"HK$2.2 billion\" should be used consistently.\n- The phrase \"exploring arrangements for using FPS for online payments\" is more natural than \"exploring arrangements to adopt FPS for online payments.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has been working with multiple government departments and the banking sector to expand the application of the Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant transactions. Since November 2019, the government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote its use and provide convenience to the public. Citizens can easily pay taxes, rates, land rent, water bills, and general government bills by scanning the QR code printed on the bills using mobile banking apps or e-wallets that support FPS. As of December 2020, there were 1.8 million transactions made via FPS for government bill payments, involving a total amount of HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four more government departments started accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service machines from December 21, 2020. The government is also exploring arrangements for using FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is that an increasing number of businesses, both large and small, are adopting the Faster Payment System (FPS) to enhance their business operations. The number of transactions involving payment merchants surged sharply in December 2020, reaching an average of 100,000 transactions per day, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is commonly used for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and other online shopping activities. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also driven a significant increase in the transaction volume of FPS-based account top-ups. The average daily transaction volume for account top-ups in December 2020 was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public awareness of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced various educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of smart usage tips on social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a secondary school WhatsApp Sticker design competition to increase students' understanding of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA has promoted the use of FPS for payments and collections among multiple charitable organizations and market operators. Several FPS-participating banks and stored value facility (SVF) operators have also launched promotional campaigns, including offering discounts, to encourage customers to register and use FPS for fund transfers and bill payments. Building on the achievements of 2020, the HKMA, in early 2021, collaborated with banks and stored value facility operators to promote the electronic distribution of lucky money through FPS. On one hand, the HKMA launched promotional activities, while on the other hand, banks and stored value facility operators provided discounts to encourage customers to distribute lucky money electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helps in the fight against the pandemic.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Grammar and Fluency**: Most translations are grammatically sound, but some suffer from awkward phrasing. For example, \"The Framework is being implemented in four phases, and banks have launched Open API for the first and second phases\" (Translation 1) is slightly awkward. A smoother structure would be preferable.\n2. **Consistency in Terminology**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"banking sector,\" \"Open API Framework,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"Open API.\" However, some translations use \"Open APIs\" (plural) inconsistently, which may not be necessary unless the context implies multiple APIs.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The use of \"brochure\" (Translation 3 and 5) versus \"booklet\" (others) is a minor variation, but \"booklet\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like government publications. \"Conducting research and investigation\" (Translation 3) is redundant and can be simplified to \"conducting research.\"\n4. **Tense and Voice**: Some translations use passive voice unnecessarily, which can make the text feel less direct. For example, \"The Framework is being implemented in four phases\" (Translation 1) could be more direct as \"The framework is implemented in four phases.\"\n5. **Clarity and Flow**: The best translations maintain a clear and logical flow, such as Translation 5, which reads smoothly and uses appropriate terminology. However, it could be improved by ensuring consistency in the use of \"Open API\" versus \"Open APIs.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should avoid redundancy, maintain a clear and logical flow, and use appropriate terminology. Based on the above review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations, ensuring consistency in terminology and clarity in expression.\n---\nThe HKMA continues to promote the banking sector to develop and provide Open API in accordance with the Open API Framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, and banks have launched Open API for the first and second phases, collaborating with third-party service providers through these Open API to explore various innovative services and enhance customer experience. On the other hand, the HKMA is conducting research on the implementation of the third and fourth phases of Open API and published a booklet in November containing the survey results.\n\n# eTradeConnect\n\nTo provide importers and exporters with more convenient trade finance services, the HKMA initiated a proof-of-concept study during the year to explore the connection between eTradeConnect and the PBoC's Trade Finance Platform. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, followed by the commencement of a pilot program. Banks in Hong Kong and mainland China have successfully completed multiple cross-border trade finance transactions using this connection.\n\n# Cross-Border Payments\n\nRegarding Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank of Thailand continue joint research to explore the application of CBDC in cross-border payments, aiming to promote the simultaneous settlement (PvP) of foreign exchange transactions involving Hong Kong dollars and Thai baht between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. Both parties have completed the first phase of the research and published a joint report in January outlining the main findings; they have also developed a blockchain-based cross-border corridor network prototype, striving to enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments and reduce costs. The second phase of the project has commenced, focusing on exploring commercial use cases for cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks have also shown strong interest in the project. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced their participation in the project in early 2021.\n"}

在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US

After experiencing significant adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, asset markets rebounded rapidly, driven by the implementation of ultra-loose monetary policies by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments around the world. Due to major central banks significantly lowering benchmark interest rates and restarting quantitative easing programmes, sovereign bond yields fell sharply while bond prices rose. In this investment environment, THE EXCHANGE FUND recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with an investment return of 5.3%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of the delegated authority by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Base,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" and \"US dollar-denominated assets.\"\n- The structure of the list (a) to (d) is preserved in all translations, which is essential for clarity and consistency.\n- Most translations use appropriate verbs like \"ensure,\" \"safeguard,\" and \"maintain\" to reflect the original intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase, which may be inconsistent with standard English usage unless it is an official title.\n- **Translation 2** redundantly uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND’s Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is unnecessarily wordy.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"to preserve capital\" and \"to seek to maximize investment returns,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less formal than alternatives.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"the Exchange Fund\" in lowercase, which may be less appropriate for a formal document.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"EFAC\" in parentheses, which is good for clarity but may be redundant if \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is already used.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Preservation of capital\" and \"Pursuing investment returns,\" which are grammatically correct but may be less idiomatic than alternatives.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\" once at the beginning for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase as per the dictionary, but ensure it is not overused.\n- Use consistent verb forms (e.g., \"ensure,\" \"safeguard,\" \"maintain\") for parallelism.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"in accordance with\" or \"subject to\" is used consistently for clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has established the following investment objectives for THE EXCHANGE FUND:  \n(a) To safeguard capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to protect the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about how certain objectives align with the statutory purposes of THE EXCHANGE FUND and are reflected in its portfolio structure and asset allocation. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"statutory objectives\" and \"portfolio structure\" — both are acceptable. However, \"take into account\" is slightly less formal than \"comprehensively address\" or \"fully consider.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"statutory purposes\" (correct), but \"composition structure\" is not a standard term in finance. \"Portfolio structure\" is more appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"legal purposes\" instead of \"statutory purposes,\" which is less precise. \"Fully consider\" is acceptable but less formal than \"comprehensively address.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"comprehensively consider\" and \"statutory purposes,\" which are both strong. Also uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase, which is appropriate for a proper noun. However, \"its\" is more concise than repeating \"of THE EXCHANGE FUND.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"take into account\" and \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase. It is accurate but slightly repetitive with \"of THE EXCHANGE FUND\" at the end.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"comprehensively address\" and \"the Fund’s portfolio structure,\" which is more concise and natural. However, \"the Fund\" may be less clear than using the full name.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"statutory purposes\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"asset allocation\" or \"asset mix\" — \"asset allocation\" is more standard in finance.\n- Use \"portfolio structure\" as it is more precise than \"composition structure.\"\n- Use \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase as it is a proper noun.\n- Avoid repetition by using \"its\" or \"the Fund’s\" where appropriate.\n- Use formal and precise language suitable for a legal or financial context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of THE EXCHANGE FUND and have been reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in style, terminology, and precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, using \"the Backing Portfolio\" and \"the Investment Portfolio\" consistently. However, \"ensure the value and long-term purchasing power of assets\" is slightly less precise than \"safeguard\" or \"preserve.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"providing full support for the Monetary Base\" and \"ensuring the preservation of asset value and long-term purchasing power.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"primarily\" instead of \"mainly,\" which is acceptable but slightly less direct.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in all caps, which may be too formal or inconsistent with the style of the other translations. It also uses \"the Currency Board system's regulations,\" which is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is well-written and uses \"as stipulated by the Currency Board arrangements,\" which is a precise and formal expression. It also uses the full name \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" instead of the acronym \"OECD,\" which is appropriate in formal contexts. However, \"ample support\" is slightly less precise than \"full support.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets,\" which is a strong and precise expression. It also uses \"the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" consistently.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and well-written. It uses \"provides full backing for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements,\" which is a strong and precise expression. It also uses \"preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets,\" which is slightly more formal than \"safeguard.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"外匯基金\" should be translated as \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" (as in the dictionary) to maintain consistency with official terminology.\n- \"支持組合\" should be translated as \"the Backing Portfolio\" (as in the dictionary).\n- \"投資組合\" should be translated as \"the Investment Portfolio\" (as in the dictionary).\n- \"經濟合作與發展組織\" should be translated as \"the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" (full name) for clarity and formality.\n- \"貨幣基礎\" should be translated as \"the Monetary Base\" (as in the dictionary).\n- \"貨幣發行局制度\" should be translated as \"the Currency Board arrangements\" (as in the dictionary).\n- \"美元資產\" should be translated as \"US dollar-denominated assets\" (as in the dictionary).\n- \"債市\" should be translated as \"bond markets\" (as in the dictionary).\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use the full name of the OECD, the all-caps version of \"THE EXCHANGE FUND,\" and precise expressions such as \"provides full backing for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements\" and \"in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\"\nTHE EXCHANGE FUND is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full backing for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and gradually diversified the asset allocation of part of THE EXCHANGE FUND into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equity securities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equity securities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value ceiling for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of THE EXCHANGE FUND, plus the sum of the portions of deposits in the Future Fund and deposits in THE EXCHANGE FUND’s subsidiaries that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by THE EXCHANGE FUND for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the evaluation of THE EXCHANGE FUND's investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"primary exception\" and \"proportion\" correctly, but \"primary exception\" is slightly awkward in context. It also uses \"proportion\" for the 40:60 ratio, which is acceptable but \"weightings\" or \"allocation\" might be more natural in financial contexts.\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the best version. It uses \"major exception\" and \"proportion\" and maintains a clear, fluent structure. However, \"proportion\" is still slightly less precise than \"allocation\" or \"weightings\" when referring to the distribution of funds.\n3. **Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"weightings\" for the 40:60 ratio, which is more natural in financial terminology. This is a strong candidate.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in all caps, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's suggestion of \"Exchange Fund\" or \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" (but not all caps). It also uses \"primary individual example,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic.\n5. **Translation 5** is nearly identical to Translation 2 and is also very strong, with only minor differences in phrasing.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"from time to time\" instead of \"occasionally,\" which is a slight variation but still correct. It also uses \"allocation\" for the 40:60 ratio, which is more natural in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- \"Exchange Fund\" should be used with \"THE\" only if it is an official title, but the dictionary allows both \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" The latter is more common in general usage.\n- \"Future Fund\" should be capitalized as per the dictionary.\n- \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" should be used with \"the\" if they are specific named portfolios, but the dictionary allows both with and without \"the.\"\n- \"Portfolio mix\" is the correct translation for \"組合比重.\"\n- \"Effective interest rate\" is the correct translation for \"實際利率.\"\n- \"Allocation\" or \"weightings\" are more natural than \"proportion\" when referring to the distribution of funds in a portfolio.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use \"Exchange Fund\" without all caps, \"Future Fund\" with capitalization, \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" with \"the\" if they are named portfolios, and \"allocation\" for the 40:60 ratio.\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from Fiscal Reserves, Government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major exception. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the effective interest rate depending on the portfolio mix. The allocation of the Future Fund in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is approximately 40:60.\n\n# The original text is simply the heading \"# 投資程序\" (with the hashtag symbol). The dictionary specifies that \"投資程序\" must be translated as \"The investment process.\" All junior translators have correctly used this exact translation. However, there are minor differences in formatting:\n- Translators 1, 5, and 6 provided only the translation without the hashtag.\n- Translators 2, 3, and 4 included the hashtag, with the fourth using \"Investment Process\" with a capital \"P.\"\nThe hashtag is likely used to denote a section heading or title, so it should be retained in the translation. Additionally, \"Investment Process\" with a capital \"P\" is more appropriate as a heading, as it follows title case conventions in English.\nBased on this, the best translation would retain the hashtag and use title case for the heading.\nThe investment process\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in terminology, phrasing, and style. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"THE EXCHANGE FUND,\" \"tactical asset allocation,\" \"tactical deviations,\" \"EFAC,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" and \"tracking error limit.\"\n- The structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor stylistic variations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"the Exchange Fund\" with lowercase \"e\" in \"Exchange Fund,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" (which should be capitalized as a proper noun).\n- The term \"asset mix\" appears in one translation (\"actual asset mix\") but is not used consistently. The dictionary lists \"asset mix\" and \"asset allocation\" as alternatives for \"資產配置,\" so both are acceptable, but consistency is key.\n- The phrase \"strategic asset allocation\" is used correctly in all translations, but one translation mistakenly uses \"strategic asset allocation\" in the context of the HKMA's authorization, which should be \"tactical asset allocation.\"\n- Some translations use \"the\" before \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" (e.g., \"the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\"), which is not necessary since it is a proper noun and should be capitalized without \"the.\"\n- The term \"portfolio managers\" is used correctly in all translations, but one translation uses \"manage the portfolio\" instead of \"manage positions,\" which is slightly less precise in the context of asset allocation.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Maintain consistency in capitalization for \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"asset allocation\" consistently unless \"asset mix\" is more appropriate in context.\n- Ensure that \"tactical asset allocation\" is used where appropriate and avoid using \"strategic asset allocation\" in the context of the HKMA's authorization.\n- Avoid unnecessary use of \"the\" before proper nouns like \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n- Use \"manage positions\" rather than \"manage the portfolio\" to align with the financial terminology used in the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTHE EXCHANGE FUND’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the form of an investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that THE EXCHANGE FUND can make to achieve its investment objectives. THE EXCHANGE FUND uses strategic allocation as a guide and, through tactical asset allocation, seeks to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limit. The HKMA is authorized to determine tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"EFIO\" and \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary. The sentence structure is clear, but \"executes\" may be slightly less precise than \"implement\" in the context of risk management strategies. Also, \"the office's staff is\" should be \"are\" for subject-verb agreement.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Investment Office\" and \"global fixed-income markets.\" The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. However, it lacks the specificity of \"HKMA\" in the first sentence, which is important for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office\" and \"derivative overlay portfolios\" correctly. The use of \"specifically responsible\" adds clarity. The translation is fluent and grammatically correct, with only minor stylistic improvements possible.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Correctly uses all dictionary terms. The sentence structure is clear and the use of \"and the derivative overlay portfolios are used to implement\" adds clarity. However, the sentence is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the standard \"HKMA\" and capitalizes \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" inconsistently. This may be confusing for readers. The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in all caps, which is not standard. Also, the phrase \"a portion of the Investment Portfolio\" is slightly less precise than \"part of the Investment Portfolio.\" The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as the standard abbreviation.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" in title case, not all caps.\n- Use \"the Investment Portfolio\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n- Use \"implement\" or \"execute\" for \"宏觀風險管理策略\" depending on context.\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement and sentence clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA's Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office's staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the Investment Portfolio includes investments in various global fixed-income markets and implements the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivative overlay portfolios.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to generate sustainable returns for the Exchange Fund, enable it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, and gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, withholding and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Exchange Fund\" or \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" for \"外匯基金.\"\n- The term \"risk management\" is consistently used for \"風險管理.\"\n- \"Lines of defence\" is correctly used for \"三重防線.\"\n- \"Risk monitoring and compliance system\" is accurately used for \"風險監察及合規制度.\"\n- \"Investment diversification\" is correctly used for \"多元化投資.\"\n- \"Liquidity\" and \"operational risk\" are correctly translated for \"流動性\" and \"業務操作風險,\" respectively.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" instead of \"HKMA\" in several places, which is a critical error.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Liquidity\" with a capital \"L\" inconsistently, and \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" is used with a capital \"T\" and \"E,\" which is not standard in English.\n- **Translation 3** omits \"investment portfolios\" and uses \"both internal and external fund managers\" without specifying that they manage the portfolios, which slightly weakens clarity.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"diversified investments\" instead of \"investment diversification,\" which is not the exact term from the dictionary.\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 4** are very similar and accurate, but \"align with the Exchange Fund's investment diversification strategy\" is slightly wordy compared to \"align with the Exchange Fund's investment diversification.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently and avoid using \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" incorrectly.\n- The term \"investment diversification\" should be used as per the dictionary.\n- \"Lines of defence\" should be used for \"三重防線.\"\n- \"Risk management and compliance\" should be used for \"風險管理及監察.\"\n- \"Investment portfolios\" should be used for \"投資組合.\"\n- \"Liquidity\" and \"operational risk\" should be used with lowercase unless they are part of a proper noun.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established three lines of defence for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and compliance. The HKMA also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), and has strengthened its risk management procedures to align with the Exchange Fund's investment diversification.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) support for responsible investment and its integration of ESG factors into the investment management of both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" and \"responsible investment\" and maintains the structure of the original sentence. However, it uses \"environmental, social and governance (ESG)\" which is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary, which lists \"environmental\" as a possible translation for \"environment, social and governance (ESG) factors.\" This may be a minor error.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing. It uses \"Exchange Fund\" without \"THE\" and omits the possessive form \"of the Exchange Fund's,\" which affects clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the first one, with the only difference being the use of \"Responsible Investment\" with a capital \"R.\" This is acceptable but may be inconsistent with the lowercase \"responsible investment\" in the dictionary. It also uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" correctly.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly omits \"environmental\" from the ESG factors, listing only \"social and governance (ESG) factors.\" This is a significant error, as the full ESG acronym includes all three components.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"social and governance (ESG) factors\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" and \"responsible investment\" correctly. However, it omits \"investment management process\" and uses \"management\" instead, which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. It uses \"Responsible Investment\" with a capital \"R\" and places \"management process\" at the end, which is less natural than the first translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" without \"The\" as it is an acronym.\n- Use \"responsible investment\" in lowercase, as per the dictionary.\n- Include the full ESG factors: \"environmental, social and governance (ESG).\"\n- Use \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"investment management process\" to maintain precision.\n- Ensure the sentence is fluent and grammatically correct.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment by incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management process of THE EXCHANGE FUND's public and private market investments.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Consistency with the Dictionary**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, with the exception of the fourth and sixth translations, which use \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" and \"Investment management managers\" respectively. These should be corrected to \"Exchange Fund\" and \"external fund managers\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some sentences are awkwardly phrased. For example, the phrase \"the implementation of various aspects of ESG\" is better phrased as \"the implementation of various ESG aspects.\" Also, the use of \"namely\" instead of \"such as\" can be improved for clarity.\n3. **Vocabulary and Terminology**: The use of \"Responsible Investment\" with capitalization is inconsistent. The dictionary allows for \"Responsible Investment,\" \"responsible investment,\" or \"RI,\" but it is better to use \"responsible investment\" in lowercase unless it is a proper noun.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial and regulatory terminology.\n5. **Clarity and Precision**: Some translations are more precise in their wording. For example, the second and fifth translations use \"actively managed mainland China equity securities portfolio,\" which is more precise than \"China equity securities portfolio.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, ensuring consistency with the dictionary, correct grammar, and natural English phrasing.\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe HKMA has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities of the Exchange Fund's investment projects. Regarding the asset portfolios managed by external fund managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through the appointed investment managers. In the process of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external fund managers, the HKMA evaluates their implementation of various ESG aspects, including the organisational setup with respect to ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and stewardship activities, such as proxy voting and portfolio company engagement (e.g., discussing ESG matters with the management of portfolio companies). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes more comprehensive ESG practices through the role of external fund managers in stewardship activities. External fund managers responsible for managing the HKMA's Hong Kong equity securities portfolio and the actively managed mainland China equity securities portfolio must commit to complying with the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission, and must provide explanations if they fail to comply. External fund managers responsible for managing developed market equities portfolios must adhere to international ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA has launched a post-appointment monitoring programme to review the implementation of proxy voting and portfolio company engagement by external fund managers.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"fixed-income portfolio,\" \"HKMA,\" \"credit risk analysis,\" \"ESG data,\" \"quantitative assessment,\" and \"ESG.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"incorporate\" or \"integrate\" to translate \"融入\" is appropriate, though \"integrate\" may be slightly more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"by expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments\" is well-rendered in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the fixed-income portfolio\" with \"the,\" which may be overly specific if the text refers to a general category of portfolios rather than a specific one.\n- The second translation uses \"will also incorporate,\" which introduces a future tense that may not be necessary if the text is descriptive rather than predictive.\n- The third translation uses \"the relevant analysis is strengthened,\" which is slightly wordy and less direct than \"the analysis is strengthened.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"integrates\" and \"the credit risk analysis of bond investments,\" which is slightly more natural and grammatically precise.\n- The fifth translation uses \"further strengthened,\" which adds a nuance not explicitly present in the original.\n- The sixth translation uses \"This will be strengthened by...\" which changes the sentence structure and may slightly alter the emphasis.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"integrate\" instead of \"incorporate\" for a more natural flow.\n- Use the plural \"portfolios\" if the original refers to a general category, unless the context clearly indicates a singular portfolio.\n- Avoid unnecessary future tense unless the original implies a future action.\n- Use \"the credit risk analysis of bond investments\" for clarity and grammatical correctness.\n- Use \"strengthened\" without additional modifiers unless the original text implies a degree of enhancement.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe fixed-income portfolios managed by HKMA staff also integrate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the analysis is strengthened.\n\nRegarding ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has been investing in green, social, and sustainability bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. In addition, the HKMA has participated in the International Finance Corporation's \"Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program,\" with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, amid increased market supply, the HKMA increased its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to expand its ESG bond portfolio through direct investment or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will adopt the ESG equities index as the investment benchmark for passive portfolios, encouraging external fund managers to establish ESG-themed equity mandates. In the coming years, the HKMA will continue to monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as active ESG mandates and low-carbon investment themes.\n\nIn the private market investment space, the HKMA reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of GPs during the due diligence process. The HKMA’s Long-Term Growth Portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and its real estate investments also incorporate warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features. The HKMA will continue to seek projects with sustainable characteristics in the future and will include green accreditation as an important consideration in real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG Workshops with GPs to exchange views and experiences on good ESG practices. At the ESG Workshop held in November, GPs exchanged views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investments. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has requested GPs to provide ESG information regarding their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"ESG,\" \"Principles for Responsible Investment,\" and \"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\" However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater clarity, fluency, and consistency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and maintain the formal tone appropriate for an official statement.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, and the flow of information is logical.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"The investment process\" with \"The\" capitalized, which is unnecessary and inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n- The phrase \"promote other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches\" is slightly awkward; \"encourage other investors to adopt\" or \"promote the adoption of responsible investment approaches by other investors\" would be more natural.\n- Some translations use \"engaging in collaboration with\" or \"interacting and cooperating with,\" which are slightly redundant or less idiomatic than \"engaging with\" or \"collaborating with.\"\n- The term \"NGFS\" is used in some translations without the full name, which may be less clear for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"the investment process\" without unnecessary capitalization.\n- Use more natural phrasing for \"promote other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches.\"\n- Use \"engaging with\" or \"collaborating with\" instead of \"interacting and cooperating with.\"\n- Include the full name of \"NGFS\" when first mentioned, followed by the acronym in parentheses.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the phrasing for greater fluency and clarity.\n---\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further integrate these standards into the investment process, including engaging with like-minded investors and international organisations. As one of the signatories of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the HKMA shoulders the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in developing best practices for ESG, promoting the adoption of responsible investment approaches by other investors. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organisation FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage business and investment decisions based on long-term goals through workshops and research. The HKMA is also involved in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and is a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). In addition, the HKMA organises seminars and actively participates in events hosted by the investment industry to share and promote the concept of ESG investments.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning. However, there are variations in fluency, structure, and formality that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" for 金管局, \"RI policy\" for 負責任投資政策, and \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" for 機構社會責任.\n- The sentence structure is generally clear and accurate.\n- The use of \"refer to,\" \"can be found in,\" and \"see\" are all appropriate in formal writing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"For information on the HKMA's RI policy framework, please refer to the chapter on 'Corporate Social Responsibility.'\" This is grammatically correct but slightly wordy and less direct.\n- The second translation is well-structured: \"Please refer to the chapter on Corporate Social Responsibility for details regarding the HKMA’s RI policy framework.\" However, \"regarding\" is slightly informal for a formal document.\n- The third translation is concise and natural: \"Details of the HKMA’s RI policy framework can be found in the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter.\" It is clear and direct.\n- The fourth translation is slightly awkward: \"The framework of HKMA's RI policy is detailed in the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter.\" The phrase \"the framework of HKMA's RI policy\" is less natural than \"the HKMA’s RI policy framework.\"\n- The fifth translation uses \"responsible investment policy\" instead of \"RI policy,\" which is not in the dictionary and thus incorrect.\n- The sixth translation is concise but uses \"see\" which is less formal than \"refer to\" or \"can be found in.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain the use of \"RI policy\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"refer to\" or \"can be found in\" for a formal tone.\n- Ensure the structure is direct and clear, avoiding unnecessary words.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\n\"Details of the HKMA’s RI policy framework can be found in the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter.\"\nDetails of the HKMA’s RI policy framework can be found in the \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" chapter.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2020\n\nSupported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the major challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, global financial markets reached record highs by year-end. Global equity markets rebounded quickly after experiencing significant adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 16%, making it the best-performing G7 equity index in 2020.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields on bonds from major developed countries continued to face pressure following a significant decline in the first quarter. The Ten-year US Treasury yields fell by approximately 100 basis points from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% by year-end. Due to a sharp rise in major government bond prices, 2020 saw very substantial mark-to-market gains from the bond markets.\n\nIn the currency markets, the decline in U.S. interest rates narrowed interest rate differentials, prompting the U.S. dollar to weaken against major currencies. This trend became more pronounced in the second half of 2020, with the euro and the Chinese yuan appreciating against the U.S. dollar by approximately 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2020.\n\nTable 1 2020 Market Returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"THE EXCHANGE FUND,\" \"equity securities,\" \"investment holding subsidiaries,\" \"the Strategic Portfolio,\" and \"valuation gains.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original text's logical flow.\n- The use of \"HKD\" or \"HK$\" is consistent across translations, though \"HK$\" is more common in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"foreign exchange valuation adjustment\" instead of \"valuation gain\" for the term \"非港元資產外匯估值上調,\" which is not the best match from the dictionary. It should be \"valuation gain.\"\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly translates \"投資收入\" as \"investment income\" for the bond investments, but the dictionary specifies \"investment income\" as the correct term for \"投資收入.\" However, it also incorrectly uses \"valuation gain\" for \"債券投資收益\" (bond investment gains), which is not a match for the dictionary term \"valuation gain.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"investment income\" for \"債券投資收益\" and \"equity securities investment income,\" which is not the exact match from the dictionary. The dictionary specifies \"investment income\" for \"投資收入,\" but not for the specific types of investments.\n- **Translation 3** is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage and clarity, but it uses \"foreign exchange valuation adjustments\" instead of \"valuation gain\" for \"非港元資產外匯估值上調,\" which is not the best match.\n- **Translation 2** is very close to the best possible version, with only minor issues in phrasing and consistency in the use of \"the Exchange Fund\" versus \"THE EXCHANGE FUND.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- \"Valuation gain\" should be used for \"估值收益\" and \"非港元資產外匯估值上調\" (non-HKD assets foreign exchange valuation adjustment), though the latter is more accurately described as a \"valuation gain\" rather than an \"adjustment.\"\n- The term \"investment income\" should be reserved for the overall \"投資收入,\" while specific investment gains (e.g., bond, equity) should be described as \"gains from bond investments,\" etc.\n- The use of \"HK$\" is preferred in financial contexts for clarity and consistency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTHE EXCHANGE FUND recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, which included HK$92.7 billion in gains from bond investments, HK$4.0 billion in gains from investments in Hong Kong equity securities, HK$69.9 billion in gains from other equity securities, HK$9.6 billion in valuation gains from non-HKD assets, and HK$59.6 billion in gains from other investments held by THE EXCHANGE FUND’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded valuation gains of HK$14.0 billion.\n"}

However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, it uses \"employee\" instead of \"staff\" and \"implementing new projects\" instead of \"new initiatives,\" which are minor but acceptable variations.\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"staff\" consistently. It uses \"maintaining financial discipline\" and \"improving information technology security,\" which are slightly different from the dictionary's \"strict control of finances\" and \"information technology security,\" but still acceptable.\n3. **Translation 3** is fluent and uses \"staff\" and \"implementing new initiatives,\" which is a slight variation from \"new projects.\" It uses \"fostering a culture of innovation,\" which is slightly different from \"encouraging a culture of innovation,\" but still appropriate.\n4. **Translation 4** is very well-written, with natural phrasing and accurate use of dictionary terms. It uses \"increasingly demanding workloads,\" which is a more nuanced expression than \"increasingly heavy workload.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is also well-written and accurate, with the use of \"strives to strengthen corporate governance\" and \"increasingly demanding workloads.\" It uses \"employees\" instead of \"staff,\" which is a minor variation.\n6. **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 2 and is accurate, but it uses \"improving information technology security\" instead of \"strengthening information technology security,\" which is a slight deviation from the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the exact terms from the dictionary where applicable. It should also use natural English expressions that reflect the original meaning without being overly literal. Based on the above review, the best elements from the translations include:\n- Using \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Using \"corporate governance\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"financial discipline\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"professional development\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"information technology security\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"culture of innovation\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"social media\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"Information Centre\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using natural expressions such as \"increasingly demanding workloads\" and \"address the challenges posed by.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the public and market through traditional and social media, its website, the Information Centre, and other channels, thereby enhancing public understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations. Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening corporate governance, including supporting staff in enhancing professional development, maintaining financial discipline, strengthening information technology security, and encouraging a culture of innovation, in order to address the challenges posed by the implementation of new projects and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"press conference,\" \"bilingual press releases,\" and \"stand-up interview.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (number of events, types of activities, and media engagement) is preserved.\n- Most translations use natural English phrasing, such as \"maintains close contact with the media,\" \"improve public understanding,\" and \"handled a large number of media inquiries.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** has grammatical issues: \"8 press conference\" and \"5 stand-up interview\" should be plural (\"conferences\" and \"interviews\"). It also uses \"also handling\" without a subject, which is awkward.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"organized\" and \"in-person,\" which are slightly more formal than \"held\" and \"physical,\" but still acceptable. It also uses \"a large volume of media inquiries,\" which is slightly more formal than the others.\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the best version, with only minor differences in phrasing.\n- **Translation 4** is nearly identical to Translation 3, with only slight differences in punctuation and phrasing.\n- **Translation 5** is the most concise and direct, but it lacks the slight variation in sentence structure that can enhance readability.\n- **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 3, but it uses \"physical\" instead of \"in-person\" and repeats \"It also\" twice, which is slightly redundant.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"held\" instead of \"organized\" or \"maintained\" for consistency with the original verb \"舉辦.\"\n- Use \"in-person\" instead of \"physical\" for clarity and modernity.\n- Ensure proper pluralization of terms like \"press conferences\" and \"stand-up interviews.\"\n- Use \"handled a large number of media inquiries daily\" for consistency and natural flow.\n- Avoid redundancy by varying sentence structure slightly, such as using \"and\" instead of \"also\" in some cases.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, the HKMA held a total of 93 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 5 stand-up interviews, and 80 other public events. It also arranged 14 media interviews and issued 552 bilingual press releases, while handling a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA's core activities, the HKMA organizes media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media as well as influential opinion leaders, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, green finance, and macroprudential measures.\n\nMr. Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, hosted an online panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020.\n\nArthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA (center), presided over a press briefing to introduce the HKMA’s two-year plan to promote the application of regulatory technology.\n\nHKMA Chief Fintech Officer Nelson Chow (left) was interviewed by Bloomberg.\nThe original sentence is a straightforward news headline, and the junior translators have all captured the essential information accurately. However, there are subtle differences in tone and structure that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nThe first translation uses \"is being interviewed,\" which implies an ongoing action, but the original sentence is in the past tense, suggesting the interview has already taken place. This makes the first translation slightly less accurate in terms of tense.\nThe second translation uses \"accepted an interview,\" which is a more formal and slightly old-fashioned phrasing. While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used in modern English news reporting, where \"was interviewed\" is more standard.\nThe third through sixth translations all use \"was interviewed,\" which is the most natural and commonly used phrasing in English for reporting past interviews. This choice aligns well with the original sentence's past tense and is the most fluent and natural option.\nThe only other minor consideration is the placement of the title \"HKMA Chief Fintech Officer.\" In the second translation, it is placed after the name, which is more formal and traditional in English, while the others place it before the name, which is also acceptable and commonly used in news headlines.\nGiven these considerations, the most natural and fluent translation would be to use \"was interviewed\" and place the title before the name, as seen in translations 3 through 6. This structure is consistent with standard English news reporting and accurately reflects the original sentence's meaning and tense.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is:\nHKMA Chief Fintech Officer Nelson Chow (left) was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, word choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"social media,\" \"COVID-19 pandemic,\" and \"financial and banking stability.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- The use of terms like \"dispel misinformation\" or \"clarify false rumors\" is appropriate and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"enhances understanding of its work\" without specifying \"public understanding,\" which is more precise.\n- The phrase \"maintain contact with the public\" is common but could be more natural as \"stay connected with the public\" or \"continue engaging with the public.\"\n- The date format \"As of the end of December 2020\" is correct, but \"As of December 31, 2020\" is more precise and commonly used in formal writing.\n- The use of \"false rumors\" is acceptable, but \"misinformation\" is more neutral and widely used in formal contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"enhance public understanding\" to be more specific and align with the original text.\n- Use \"As of December 31, 2020\" for clarity and precision.\n- Use \"misinformation\" instead of \"false rumors\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"continue engaging with the public\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the HKMA's efforts.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural phrasing, precise terminology, and clarity.\nThe HKMA enhances public understanding of its work and strengthens communication with the public through social media. It currently operates five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. As of December 31, 2020, over 66,500 users followed the HKMA's social media pages. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA has effectively used social media to continue engaging with the public and clarify misinformation related to financial and banking stability.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s core activities and operations. In 2020, it handled a total of 9,514 enquiries, with approximately half relating to banking sector policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, notes and coins, financial infrastructure, and debt market development, particularly the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, guidelines and announcements related to the banking sector, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, and monetary and economic data.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2017, and Figure 2 shows the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice. The term \"公眾查詢\" is translated as either \"Public Queries\" or \"Public Inquiries.\" Both are acceptable, but \"Inquiries\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official or statistical contexts, which seems appropriate for a title like this. \"Queries\" is also correct but may be more commonly associated with technical or database-related contexts.\n\"總數\" is consistently translated as \"Total Number,\" which is accurate and natural in English. The use of a colon after \"Figure 1\" is standard in such titles, and all translations follow this format correctly.\nAmong the translations, \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" (Translation 2 and 5) is the most natural and appropriate, as it uses the more formal and contextually suitable term \"Inquiries.\" The other translations are also acceptable, but \"Inquiries\" better conveys the intended meaning of a formal or official request for information, which aligns well with the likely context of the data being presented in \"Figure 1.\"\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries,\" as it is both accurate and stylistically appropriate.\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2020 Categorized by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA's Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year, and regularly updated the data in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. In addition, the HKMA published 18 \"Insights\" articles, introducing the HKMA's important measures and policies, and discussing issues of public concern.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward news statement about an award received by the HKMA's 2019 Annual Report. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, prepositions, and structure that affect fluency and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"最佳年報評選\" as \"Best Annual Reports Awards,\" \"香港管理專業協會\" as \"Hong Kong Management Association,\" and \"金管局\" as \"HKMA.\"\n- Most translations use \"Silver Award\" correctly and place the award category appropriately.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 4** is problematic because it incorrectly states that the HKMA presented the award to itself, which is illogical and confusing.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"received a Silver Award\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less dynamic than \"won.\"\n- **Translation 2** and **3** use \"won the Silver Award\" and \"won the Silver Award,\" respectively, which are more active and natural.\n- **Translation 5** and **6** are very similar to 2 and 3, with minor differences in prepositions and punctuation.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"won\" instead of \"received\" for a more dynamic tone.\n- Ensure that the preposition \"at\" is used correctly to indicate the location of the event.\n- Maintain consistency in the use of possessive forms (e.g., \"HKMA’s\" vs. \"HKMA's\").\n- Ensure that the award category is clearly enclosed in quotation marks and properly placed in the sentence.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA’s 2019 Annual Report won a Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2020 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, the phrase \"documents for the public to access the latest information from the HKMA\" is slightly awkward. It would be more natural to say \"to access the HKMA’s latest information.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"records of\" instead of \"registers of,\" which is less precise in the context of legal and regulatory documents. Also, \"authorized institutions register of securities staff\" is awkwardly phrased and should be \"register of securities staff of authorized institutions.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"facilitating public access\" and \"maintained under\" appropriately. However, it omits the term \"認可機構\" in the phrase \"register of securities staff,\" which should be included for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and content. It uses \"maintained in accordance with\" consistently and correctly. However, the phrase \"facilitating the public's access\" is slightly less natural than \"facilitating public access.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"enabling the public to access\" and \"maintained under\" appropriately. However, it omits the term \"認可機構\" in the phrase \"register of securities staff,\" which should be included for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"enabling the public to access\" and \"maintained under\" appropriately. However, the structure of the sentence is slightly fragmented, and the phrase \"as well as the'register of securities staff of authorized institutions' and the'register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees'\" could be more clearly ordered.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"facilitating public access\" is more natural than \"enabling the public to access.\"\n- The term \"maintained under\" is more appropriate than \"kept in accordance with\" in the context of legal documents.\n- The phrase \"register of securities staff of authorized institutions\" should be used to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n- The structure should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations while ensuring clarity and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nThe HKMA’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 40,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the HKMA’s latest information. The website also contains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical precision, and consistency with the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"financial data\" for \"金融數據.\"\n- The term \"Open API\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary's preferred translation.\n- The temporal expressions (\"since 2018,\" \"by the end of 2020\") are appropriately used to convey the timeline.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Open Application Programming Interface (Open API)\" which, while technically correct, is unnecessarily verbose and not in line with the dictionary's preference for \"Open API.\"\n- The use of \"Open APIs\" versus \"Open API sets\" is inconsistent. The original text uses \"開放API\" which is best translated as \"Open API sets\" to reflect the pluralization of API groups.\n- The phrase \"as scheduled\" is used in some translations but is not always necessary or natural in context.\n- Some translations use \"launched\" for \"發放,\" which is slightly off. \"Released\" or \"made available\" might be more accurate.\n- The placement of \"on its website\" varies, which can affect clarity and flow.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistency in using \"Open API\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Open API sets\" to reflect the pluralization of API groups.\n- Use \"released\" or \"made available\" instead of \"launched\" for \"發放.\"\n- Ensure that \"as scheduled\" is used only when necessary and in a natural context.\n- Improve sentence structure for better flow and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nSince 2018, the HKMA has been progressively releasing financial data and important information published on its website through Open API. By the end of 2020, the HKMA had made available a total of 144 Open API sets on its website as scheduled.\n\nThe original sentence, \"金管局積極支持開放API的發展及應用,\" translates to \"The HKMA actively supports the development and application of Open API.\" All six junior translations are nearly identical, with only minor differences in the inclusion of the article \"The\" before \"HKMA.\" \nThe term \"金管局\" is correctly translated as \"HKMA\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary entry. Similarly, \"開放API\" is consistently translated as \"Open API,\" also in line with the dictionary. The verb phrase \"積極支持\" is accurately rendered as \"actively supports,\" and the noun phrase \"發展及應用\" is correctly translated as \"development and application.\"\nHowever, there is a slight inconsistency in the use of the article \"The\" before \"HKMA.\" While the first, third, and fourth translations include \"The,\" the second, fifth, and sixth omit it. In English, it is more natural and grammatically correct to use \"The HKMA\" when referring to a specific organization, especially in formal or official contexts. This is because \"HKMA\" is an acronym for \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" and using the definite article \"The\" helps clarify that it refers to the specific entity.\nIn terms of fluency and naturalness, all translations are acceptable, but including \"The\" before \"HKMA\" enhances clarity and formality, which is appropriate given the context of the sentence. There are no issues with grammar, vocabulary, or cultural appropriateness in any of the translations.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is recommended to include \"The\" before \"HKMA\" to ensure grammatical correctness and clarity. The rest of the sentence is already well-translated, so no further changes are necessary.\nThe HKMA actively supports the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" and \"資訊中心\" as \"Information Centre.\"\n- The term \"《銀行業條例》第20條\" is consistently translated as \"section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\"\n- The term \"證券業務員工紀錄冊\" is translated as \"register of securities staff\" in all translations, which is correct.\n- The term \"認可機構\" is translated as \"authorized institutions\" in most translations, which is the preferred term from the dictionary.\n- The term \"本地代表辦事處\" is translated as \"local representative offices\" in all translations, which is accurate.\n- The term \"中央銀行\" is translated as \"central banking\" in all translations, which is appropriate in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in \"國際金融中心\":** Some translations use \"International Financial Centre\" with capitalization, while others use lowercase. The dictionary lists all three variations, but for consistency, it is best to use \"International Financial Centre\" with proper capitalization.\n- **\"銀行業\" vs. \"banking sector\":** While \"banking sector\" is used in most translations, \"banking\" is also acceptable and may be more concise.\n- **\"圖書館\" vs. \"Library\":** Some translations capitalize \"Library\" when referring to the specific facility, which is appropriate.\n- **\"認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊\" vs. \"register of authorized institutions and local representative offices\":** This is correctly translated in most translations, but the use of \"authorized institutions\" is more precise than \"AIs\" or \"Als.\"\n- **\"資料與展品\" vs. \"materials and exhibits\":** This is accurate, but \"reference materials\" or \"resources\" could be alternatives.\n- **\"保持\" vs. \"maintains\" or \"keeps\":** \"Maintains\" is more formal and appropriate for official records.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use consistent capitalization for proper nouns like \"International Financial Centre.\"\n- Use \"banking\" rather than \"banking sector\" where it is more concise and natural.\n- Use \"Library\" with a capital \"L\" when referring to the specific facility.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" as it is the most precise and formal term.\n- Use \"maintains\" for \"保持\" when referring to official records.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated exactly as specified.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2, introducing the public to the HKMA's work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector in an interactive manner, and also provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics related to Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions\" as stipulated in section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe original text highlights the HKMA Information Centre's achievement in winning a Platinum Award in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS,\" emphasizing its unique atmosphere and design. The junior translators have all captured the core message, but there are variations in fluency, word choice, and structure.\nStrengths across the translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Information Centre,\" and \"Interior Design category.\" All translations convey the main idea clearly and accurately. However, there are differences in the flow and naturalness of the English sentences.\nThe first translation is fluent and natural, with a clear cause-and-effect structure. The second translation is also well-structured, with a slightly more concise phrasing. The third and fourth translations are similar, with minor differences in prepositions and word choice. The fifth translation places the reason for the success at the beginning, which is slightly less natural in English. The sixth translation uses \"uniquely atmospheric environment,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and may not be as commonly used as \"unique atmosphere.\"\nImprovements could focus on ensuring the sentence flows naturally in English, using common phrasing, and maintaining a clear cause-and-effect relationship. The phrase \"thanks to its carefully designed and unique atmosphere\" is effective and natural. The use of \"stood out among over a thousand participants from around the world\" is also appropriate.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and natural flow of the original message, using common and natural English phrasing while ensuring the dictionary terms are correctly used.\nThe HKMA Information Centre stood out among over a thousand participants from around the world, thanks to its carefully designed and unique atmosphere, and became one of the winners of the Platinum Award in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Information Centre,\" \"Policy Section,\" \"HKMA,\" \"interactive facilities,\" and \"COVID-19 pandemic.\" This is a strength across all translations.\n2. **Fluency and Naturalness**: While all translations are grammatically correct, some use more natural and idiomatic expressions than others. For example, \"took advantage of the opportunity\" (used in translations 1, 4, and 5) is more natural than \"took the opportunity provided by\" (used in translation 3) or \"took the opportunity during\" (used in translation 6).\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The phrase \"optimize its facilities\" (translation 1) is slightly more formal than \"upgrade the facilities\" (used in translations 2, 5, and 6), which may be more appropriate in a context that emphasizes improvement rather than a complete overhaul. \"Enhance the facilities\" (translation 4) is also a good alternative.\n4. **Verb Tense and Consistency**: The original text uses past tense to describe actions completed in 2020. Most translations use past tense consistently, but translation 3 uses \"has taken\" (present perfect), which is less appropriate in this context.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard English terms for institutions and concepts without unnecessary localization.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Information Centre took advantage of the temporary closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to upgrade the facilities in the Policy Section. This section explains the work of the HKMA and introduces related financial concepts. The improvements were made in response to visitor feedback, making the interactive facilities easier to use, more engaging, and more durable, thereby enhancing the overall visiting experience.\n\nThe original sentence, \"資訊中心「政策」展區的互動設施完成優化工程,\" translates to \"The interactive facilities in the 'Policy' Section of the Information Centre have completed the optimization project.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The interactive facilities in the Policy Section of the Information Centre have completed the optimization project.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, clear structure, and accurate meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"have completed the optimization project\" is slightly awkward. It implies the facilities themselves completed the project, which is not the intended meaning. The facilities were the subject of the optimization, not the ones performing it.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The Information Centre’s Policy Section interactive facilities have been upgraded.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and natural-sounding.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Upgraded\" is a more general term and does not precisely reflect \"優化工程\" (optimization project). Also, it omits the specific mention of the project, which may be important in a formal context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The Information Centre’s Policy Section interactive facilities have completed optimization work.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the dictionary terms correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the first translation, the phrase \"have completed optimization work\" is awkward and implies the facilities themselves performed the work.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The interactive facilities in the 'Policy' section of the Information Centre have been completed with optimization.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"have been completed with optimization\" is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It suggests the facilities were completed using optimization, which is not the intended meaning.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The interactive facilities in the Policy Section of the Information Centre have completed the optimization project.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms and clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue as the first translation: the facilities are incorrectly portrayed as completing the project.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The interactive facilities in the 'Policy Section' of the Information Centre have completed the optimization project.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms and clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue as the first and fifth translations: the facilities are incorrectly portrayed as completing the project.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe key issue across all translations is the incorrect implication that the interactive facilities themselves completed the optimization project. In reality, the optimization project was carried out on the facilities, not by them. A more accurate and natural phrasing would be to use the passive voice or rephrase the sentence to reflect that the facilities were the subject of the optimization.\nThe best approach is to use the passive voice: \"The interactive facilities in the Policy Section of the Information Centre have been optimized.\"\nThis version:\n- Correctly uses the dictionary terms.\n- Uses natural English grammar.\n- Accurately reflects the meaning that the facilities underwent an optimization project.\n- Avoids the awkward implication that the facilities themselves completed the project.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe interactive facilities in the Policy Section of the Information Centre have been optimized.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, and the junior translators have mostly captured its meaning accurately. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and fluency that can be refined.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"exhibition area\" and \"currency and the banking sector.\" While grammatically correct, \"currency and the banking sector\" is slightly awkward and less natural than \"currency and banking sector.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"exhibition section\" and \"Hong Kong's currency and banking sector.\" This is fluent and accurate, with proper use of possessive form for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Identical to the second, so the same evaluation applies.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"exhibition section\" and \"Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector.\" The possessive form is correctly used, and the phrasing is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"exhibition hall,\" which is a slightly more specific term than \"exhibition section\" or \"exhibition area.\" It is still acceptable, though \"exhibition section\" may be more commonly used in institutional contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Identical to the second, so the same evaluation applies.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Exhibition section\" is a common and natural term in institutional contexts, making it a good choice.\n- \"Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector\" is the most natural and grammatically correct phrasing, as it clearly indicates that the development pertains to Hong Kong.\n- The possessive form \"Hong Kong’s\" is more appropriate than \"Hong Kong's\" in formal writing, though both are acceptable.\n- \"Exhibition hall\" is slightly more specific and may be less commonly used in this context, so \"exhibition section\" is preferable for consistency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe exhibition section of the Information Centre introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector.\n\nTo ensure that the public, regardless of ethnicity, can equally access the facilities of the Information Centre, the centre has established procedures to provide interpretation services for visitors requiring assistance and individuals calling the centre's hotline for inquiries.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Information Centre\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The term \"anti-microbial coating\" is consistently used where required.\n- The main message about the pandemic affecting operations and the implementation of special arrangements and hygiene measures is preserved in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"preventative measures\" and \"disinfected with an anti-microbial coating,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less natural than alternatives.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"operation and service hours\" and \"preventive measures,\" which are acceptable but not as commonly used as \"opening hours.\"\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the best version, with only minor issues in phrasing.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"epidemic prevention measures\" and \"hygiene environment,\" which are less idiomatic in English.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"throughout the year\" instead of \"this year,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 6** is the most fluent and natural, using \"protect public safety\" and \"strengthened cleaning and disinfection,\" which are more idiomatic than \"ensure public safety\" and \"enhanced cleaning and disinfection.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use natural English phrasing. It should also accurately reflect the original message, including the implementation of special arrangements and the use of anti-microbial coating for disinfection. Based on the above analysis, the most natural and accurate version would combine the best elements from the translations, particularly from Translation 6, which uses \"protect public safety\" and \"strengthened cleaning and disinfection,\" and from Translation 3, which uses \"preventive measures\" and \"regularly disinfected using anti-microbial coating.\"\nThe final translation should also avoid redundancy and ensure that the sentence structure is clear and concise.\nThe Information Centre’s opening hours and services have been affected due to the ongoing pandemic. To protect public safety and maintain a high standard of hygiene, the Information Centre has implemented special opening arrangements and preventive measures this year, and has strengthened cleaning and disinfection. Facilities and exhibits are also regularly disinfected using anti-microbial coating.\n\n# Public and Consumer Education\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA's work, the HKMA held an online public education seminar in 2020, attracting over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. This was the first time the education seminar, which was introduced in 1998, was held in an online format, and to date, over 61,000 students and teachers have participated.\n\nOver 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools participated in the HKMA’s online public education seminar.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality and naturalness of the English translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Protection of personal digital keys,\" and \"COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message is preserved across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning without major errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in vocabulary:** Some translations use \"wise,\" \"smart,\" \"sensible,\" \"savvy,\" and \"savvy\" to translate \"精明.\" While all are acceptable, \"savvy\" and \"smart\" are more natural in this context.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations use phrases like \"at all times and in all places\" or \"regardless of when or where,\" which are repetitive and can be simplified to \"at all times and places\" or \"at all times and wherever.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use phrases like \"maintains communication with the public on this matter\" or \"stays connected with the public on this matter,\" which are slightly awkward compared to \"maintains communication with the public regarding this\" or \"stays in touch with the public on this matter.\"\n- **Consistency in phrasing:** Some translations use \"reminds citizens\" while others use \"reminds the public,\" which should be consistent for clarity and tone.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"savvy\" or \"smart\" for \"精明\" to reflect the intended nuance of being shrewd or knowledgeable.\n- Simplify and streamline phrases to avoid redundancy and improve fluency.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"public\" or \"citizens\" and maintain a consistent tone throughout the translation.\n- Use natural English expressions such as \"reminds the public to be vigilant\" or \"urges citizens to safeguard their information.\"\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe HKMA educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers and maintains communication with the public on this matter. One of the key focuses of the related educational efforts continues to be \"Protection of personal digital keys.\" This year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos urging citizens to properly safeguard their financial accounts and personal information at all times and places. Given the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA reminds the public to be vigilant when shopping online or using personal authentication information and to guard against fraud.\n\nTo increase young people’s interest in working at the HKMA, the HKMA launched the public education online drama series “STEPS” in 2020 and posted a series of related posts on social media, introducing the HKMA’s work in areas such as currency, the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, financial inclusion, banking supervision, and international cooperation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: “公眾教育網劇《STEPS》” is consistently translated as “public education online drama series 'STEPS'”, “主要職能” as “core activities”, and “金管局” as “HKMA”. All translations maintain the core message of the original text: that the drama series uses a light-hearted approach to introduce the HKMA’s core activities through the story of a young, newly hired individual.\nWeaknesses include minor variations in phrasing that may affect fluency. For example, “light-hearted” and “lighthearted” are both acceptable, but “light-hearted” is more commonly used in formal writing. The phrase “newly hired young person” is repeated in several translations, which, while accurate, lacks variety. Alternatives such as “young newcomer” or “newly employed young person” offer slight variation without altering the meaning.\nThe structure of the sentences also varies slightly. Some translations place the method of delivery (“uses a light-hearted approach”) before the subject (“through the growth story”), while others reverse the order. The latter tends to be more natural in English, as it follows the subject-verb-object structure more closely.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the correct terminology, use natural and fluent English, and avoid repetition in phrasing. It should also follow a logical sentence structure that is typical in English writing.\nImproved Translation:\nThe public education online drama series \"STEPS\" uses a light-hearted approach to introduce the HKMA's core activities through the growth story of a young newcomer.\n\nThe HKMA widely promotes messages on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"community engagement programmes\" for \"社區參與活動,\" which is consistent with the dictionary. This is a strength across all translations.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some variations exist. For example, the first and third translations use \"initiative\" and \"activity\" respectively, which are both acceptable but \"initiative\" may sound more formal and structured, which aligns well with the context of a government or regulatory body like the HKMA.\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The term \"financial education programme\" is used in translations 1, 2, and 3, while \"financial education activity\" is used in translations 3, 4, and 5. \"Programme\" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies a structured and organized effort, which is consistent with the HKMA's role.\n4. **Title of the Activity**: The title \"小小理財師\" is translated as \"Little Financial Managers\" in translations 1 and 3, and as \"Little Financial Experts\" in translations 4, 5, and 6. \"Managers\" may be more accurate in the context of teaching children about managing money, while \"Experts\" may be slightly overambitious for the target audience (kindergarten and primary students). \"Little Financial Managers\" is more appropriate.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The use of \"DIY toys\" and \"homemade toys\" is slightly different. \"DIY toys\" is more commonly used in educational contexts and is more concise. \"Homemade toys\" may imply that the toys are made by the children or parents, which is not explicitly stated in the original text.\n6. **Variations in Structure**: Some translations use \"it teaches\" while others use \"this initiative teaches.\" The latter is more formal and better suited for a document that may be used in official or educational contexts.\n7. **Use of \"Colouring contests\" vs. \"coloring contests\"**: The British English spelling \"colouring\" is used in translations 1, 3, and 6, while \"coloring\" is used in translations 2, 4, and 5. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is often associated with Hong Kong and thus British English, \"colouring\" is more appropriate.\n8. **Use of \"competition\" vs. \"contest\"**: \"Colouring contests\" is more commonly used in educational contexts than \"colouring competitions.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the structure and formality of the first and third translations, use \"Little Financial Managers\" for the title, and ensure consistency in vocabulary and spelling.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has also collaborated with various stakeholders through multiple community engagement programmes, one of which is the online parent-child financial education programme \"Little Financial Managers.\" This initiative teaches kindergarten and primary school students the basic concepts of money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge about banking and payment services, through animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and colouring contests.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and straightforward: \"以Dollar豬和金氏一家為主角的動畫影片，就五個主題發放訊息。\" The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the main subject: an animated film featuring \"Dollar Pig\" and \"the Kim family.\"\n- The use of \"conveys messages on five themes\" or \"delivers messages on five themes\" is accurate and natural.\n- The placement of the phrase \"featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family\" is generally well handled, with only minor stylistic variations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"conveys messages on five themes,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly formal. \"Delivers messages\" (used in translations 3 and 6) is more dynamic and natural in this context.\n- Translation 5 incorrectly uses \"Jin Family\" instead of \"Kim family,\" which is a clear error.\n- Translation 3 uses \"animated video\" instead of \"animated film,\" which is less precise given the context of a film with thematic messages.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Animated film\" is more appropriate than \"animated video\" in this context, as it implies a structured, narrative work.\n- \"Delivers messages\" is more natural and active than \"conveys messages.\"\n- \"The Kim family\" should be used consistently, as it is the correct transliteration of \"金氏一家.\"\n- The placement of the phrase \"featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family\" should be clear and not disrupt the flow of the sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe animated film featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family delivers messages on five themes.\n\nDemonstrate how to make toys from eco-friendly materials.\n\nOther work related to youth education includes an online financial literacy quiz competition, online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, collaboration with a professional organization to produce comic books targeting primary school students and parents, as well as online seminars for university students.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) support for the Investor and Financial Education Council in improving the financial literacy of Hong Kong residents and exploring further collaboration with stakeholders to enhance community engagement. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms \"HKMA\" and \"Investor and Financial Education Council.\" All translations convey the core message accurately. However, there are minor variations in terms like \"financial literacy,\" \"capabilities,\" \"residents,\" \"citizens,\" \"collaboration,\" \"cooperation,\" and \"community engagement\" versus \"community participation.\"\n\"Financial literacy\" is more commonly used in English to describe the understanding of financial concepts, while \"financial knowledge and skills\" is also acceptable but slightly more general. \"Residents\" and \"citizens\" are both correct, but \"residents\" may be more neutral and inclusive in this context. \"Collaboration\" and \"cooperation\" are nearly synonymous, but \"collaboration\" is often preferred in formal contexts. \"Community engagement\" is more precise than \"community participation\" when referring to structured efforts to involve the public.\nThe best translation would use \"financial literacy and capabilities,\" \"residents,\" \"collaboration,\" and \"community engagement\" for clarity and fluency.\nBased on this review, the improved translation is:\nHKMA supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong residents and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# HKMA Staff\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"highly professional team\" and \"flexibly respond to changes in work requirements.\" However, \"highly professional\" may be slightly redundant, as \"professional\" alone is sufficient.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"professional and excellent workforce\" and \"adapt flexibly to changes in work requirements.\" The phrase \"adapt flexibly\" is slightly less natural than \"flexibly respond.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"professional and competent workforce\" and \"flexibly respond to changing work requirements.\" \"Competent\" is a good choice, but \"changing work requirements\" is slightly less precise than \"changes in work requirements.\"\n4. **Translation 4** omits \"The\" before \"HKMA\" in the first sentence, which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"changing work requirements,\" which is slightly less precise.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"expertise\" instead of \"specialized knowledge,\" which is a valid synonym but slightly less specific. It also uses \"high-quality workforce,\" which is a good choice but slightly more formal than \"professional and competent.\"\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"talent\" instead of \"individuals\" and \"changing job requirements\" instead of \"changes in work requirements.\" \"Talent\" is a good synonym, but \"job requirements\" is slightly less precise than \"work requirements.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- \"HKMA\" should be capitalized consistently.\n- \"Employees\" or \"staff\" is more natural than \"individuals\" or \"talent.\"\n- \"Professional and competent workforce\" is a balanced and accurate choice.\n- \"Flexibly respond to changes in work requirements\" is the most natural and precise phrasing.\n- \"Specialized knowledge\" is the most accurate translation of the original term.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural and precise phrasing while maintaining the original meaning and structure.\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and competent workforce to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work requirements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in vocabulary, fluency, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The translations effectively convey the key points: staffing levels in 2020 and 2021, the efforts to manage resources, and the planned reallocation of resources for new and expanded work.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The use of terms like \"staffing level,\" \"staff strength,\" \"staff complement,\" and \"personnel\" varies across translations. While all are acceptable, \"staff strength\" and \"staff complement\" are more formal and precise, but \"staffing level\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use phrases that sound slightly awkward or overly formal, such as \"strived to allocate existing resources flexibly\" or \"was committed to meeting the needs of new initiatives.\"\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat the phrase \"existing resources\" unnecessarily, which can be simplified for better readability.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The translations are generally culturally appropriate, but the use of \"newly launched\" and \"newly initiated\" can be slightly inconsistent in tone.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Use \"staffing level\" as it is the most commonly used and natural term in official reports.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Use active voice where possible and avoid overly formal or repetitive phrasing.\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Simplify sentence structures where possible to enhance readability without losing meaning.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"staffing level,\" maintain a natural and fluent tone, and ensure clarity and conciseness.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA had a staffing level of 1,005 in 2020. During the year, the HKMA focused on meeting the needs of new projects and increasing workloads by flexibly allocating existing resources, improving efficiency, and streamlining work procedures. The HKMA’s staffing level will remain at 1,005 in 2021, and existing resources will be reallocated to address the following new initiatives and expanded areas of work:\n\n# Banking and Financial Sector Stability  \n- Support policy development for Wealth Management Connect, as well as other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) initiatives related to private wealth management, and ongoing supervision of Wealth Management Connect operations  \n- Handle licensing under the Insurance Ordinance and the new OTC derivatives regime, as well as conduct supervision related to virtual banks  \n- Implement new regulatory requirements concerning climate risks, and enhance prudential supervision of banks\n\n# Reserves Management  \n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to align with the Exchange Fund's ongoing expansion and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre  \n- To strengthen support for participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups  \n- To manage the newly proposed carried interest tax concession regime and verify the eligibility of funds for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the HKMA by department.\n\nTable 1: HKMA Staff Establishment and Actual Number of Employees as of January 1, 2021\nTable 1: HKMA Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2021\nTable 1: HKMA Establishment and Actual Number of Staff as of January 1, 2021\nTable 1: HKMA Staffing Establishment and Actual Number of Staff Members as of January 1, 2021\nTable 1: Established Positions and Actual Staff Numbers of the HKMA as of January 1, 2021\nTable 1: HKMA Staffing Structure and Actual Number of Employees as of 1 January 2021\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and terminology that affect fluency and precision.\nThe term \"職位編制\" is translated in various ways: \"Staff Establishment,\" \"Establishment,\" \"Staffing Establishment,\" \"Staffing Structure,\" and \"Established Positions.\" While all are acceptable, \"Staff Establishment\" and \"Staffing Structure\" are more precise in the context of organizational structure. \"Established Positions\" is less common in formal English usage for this context.\nThe term \"實際職員人數\" is translated as \"Actual Number of Employees,\" \"Actual Staff Numbers,\" \"Actual Number of Staff,\" and \"Actual Number of Staff Members.\" \"Actual Number of Employees\" is the most natural and commonly used phrasing in formal contexts.\nThe date format \"2021年1月1日\" is translated as \"January 1, 2021\" or \"1 January 2021.\" Both are correct, but \"January 1, 2021\" is more commonly used in American English, while \"1 January 2021\" is more common in British English. Since the original text uses the Chinese format, either is acceptable, but \"January 1, 2021\" is more universally recognized.\nThe term \"金管局\" is consistently translated as \"HKMA,\" which is correct according to the dictionary.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"Staff Establishment\" for \"職位編制\" and \"Actual Number of Employees\" for \"實際職員人數,\" with the date formatted as \"January 1, 2021.\"\nTable 1: HKMA Staff Establishment and Actual Number of Employees as of January 1, 2021\n\n# Salary and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\nThe original text is a title, and the goal is to produce a clear, professional, and natural English title that accurately reflects the content. The junior translators have all provided very similar translations, with only minor variations in word choice.\nThe first junior translator used \"Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism.\" This is accurate and professional, though \"Compensation\" is slightly broader than \"Salary\" and may be more appropriate in a general corporate context.\nThe second junior translator used \"Compensation and benefits policy and salary review mechanism.\" This version is slightly less consistent in capitalization and uses lowercase \"benefits\" and \"salary,\" which may be less formal for a title.\nThe third junior translator used \"Salary and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism.\" This is a strong option, as \"Salary\" is more specific and may be more appropriate if the focus is on employee pay rather than broader compensation.\nThe fourth and sixth junior translators used \"Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism,\" which is consistent and professional.\nThe fifth junior translator included the \"#\" symbol, which is unnecessary in a title unless it is part of a document structure.\nConsidering all options, \"Salary and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\" is the most precise and natural translation, assuming the focus is on salary rather than broader compensation. However, if the context is more general and includes benefits like bonuses, insurance, and other forms of compensation, \"Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\" may be more appropriate.\nSince the dictionary is empty, there are no specific terms that need to be translated exactly, so the choice between \"Compensation\" and \"Salary\" depends on the intended meaning and context. Given the lack of context, \"Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\" is a safe and professional choice.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with correct use of dictionary terms. However, \"seeks the views of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the Governance Sub-Committee\" is slightly awkward. It should be clearer that the Financial Secretary consults the Governance Sub-Committee *through* the EFAC.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"receives advice from its Governance Sub-Committee\" and \"determines the salary and terms of service,\" which are natural and precise. The use of \"variable pay\" and \"provident fund scheme\" is correct.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation misplaces the EFAC, stating that the Financial Secretary \"heard the views of the Governance Sub-Committee under the EFAC,\" which is not accurate. The EFAC is the body through which the Financial Secretary consults the GSC. Also, \"variable pay\" is listed twice, which is confusing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with correct use of dictionary terms. However, \"base salary\" is not one of the dictionary alternatives for \"basic salary,\" so it should be \"basic salary\" instead.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"basic salary\" and \"variable pay.\" However, it includes \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in parentheses, which is unnecessary since \"HKMA\" is already used.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with correct use of dictionary terms and natural phrasing. It clearly states that the Financial Secretary seeks the opinion of the GSC *under* the EFAC, which is accurate. The use of \"employees\" instead of \"staff\" is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms: \"EFAC,\" \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"HKMA,\" \"GSC,\" \"Governance Sub-Committee,\" \"variable pay,\" and \"provident fund scheme.\"\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for a government document.\nBased on this, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the second, fourth, and sixth translations, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and natural phrasing.\n---\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Governance Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and, with reference to market salary levels and practices, determines the salaries and service conditions of HKMA employees. The salary package includes cash salary and a provident fund scheme, along with some basic benefits. Cash salary comprises a monthly fixed salary (i.e., basic salary) and variable pay, which is paid annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"EFAC,\" \"GSC,\" \"FS,\" and \"financial sector.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate vocabulary, such as \"review,\" \"consider,\" \"special adjustments,\" and \"salary competitiveness.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"seeks advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the performance of the Governance Sub-Committee under their jurisdiction,\" which is slightly awkward and unclear in meaning.\n- **Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, but it adds \"(HKMA)\" and \"(EFAC)\" in parentheses, which may be unnecessary in formal writing.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"he listens to the recommendations,\" which is less formal and less precise than \"seeks\" or \"consults.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"will solicit advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee through its Governance Sub-Committee,\" which is slightly off in meaning, as the GSC is not a channel through which the EFAC provides advice.\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the original in structure and meaning, with only minor wording differences.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"remuneration\" instead of \"salaries,\" which is acceptable but slightly more formal. It also uses \"separately\" in \"adjusted separately,\" which is not present in the original and may be unnecessary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the dictionary terms correctly.\n- It should avoid unnecessary parenthetical explanations and maintain a formal yet natural tone.\n- The phrase \"through the EFAC, he listens to the recommendations\" should be replaced with a more precise expression, such as \"by consulting the EFAC.\"\n- The phrase \"special adjustments may also be made to the salaries\" is more natural than \"subject to special adjustments.\"\n- The use of \"review\" is appropriate, but \"reviews\" is more consistent with the original verb form.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of HKMA employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) for the recommendations of its Governance Sub-Committee (GSC). The review also considers the GSC’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a financial sector salary survey conducted by an independent human resources consulting firm, and other relevant factors. Salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments to serve as a reward and maintain their salary competitiveness.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"variable pay,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" and \"Governance Sub-Committee (GSC).\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points about salary adjustments and approval processes are preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate formal language suitable for official documentation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistencies in titles:** Some translations use \"Assistant Chief Executive\" while others use \"Deputy Chief Executive\" or \"Assistant Vice President.\" The original text uses \"助理總裁及以上職級\" which should be translated as \"Assistant Chief Executive and above.\"\n- **Ambiguity in \"主管及以下職級\":** Some translations use \"Director and below,\" others use \"Manager and below,\" or \"supervisors and below.\" The term \"主管\" is best translated as \"Director\" in this context.\n- **Variations in phrasing:** Phrases like \"adjustments to fixed pay and the distribution of variable pay\" are repeated, but some translations use \"issuance of variable pay\" or \"disbursement of variable pay,\" which are less standard in HR contexts.\n- **Fluency and clarity:** Some translations are slightly awkward or repetitive, such as \"based on the lump sum approved for paying salaries\" or \"using the total approved amount for salary payments.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"Assistant Chief Executive and above\" consistently for \"助理總裁及以上職級.\"\n- Use \"Director and below\" for \"主管及以下職級.\"\n- Use \"distribution of variable pay\" as it is the most standard and clear phrasing.\n- Ensure that the term \"Financial Secretary\" is used consistently, and that \"Governance Sub-Committee\" is used with the abbreviation \"(GSC)\" where appropriate.\n- Maintain a formal and precise tone, avoiding redundancy and ensuring clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed pay and variable pay based on individual employee performance; the variable pay system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed pay and the distribution of variable pay for Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC), with the relevant employees excusing themselves from meetings discussing their pay proposals. Adjustments to fixed pay and the distribution of variable pay for Directors and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, based on the lump sum approved for salary payments, under the authority of the Financial Secretary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and vocabulary choice that affect the overall quality of each translation. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" or \"corporate social responsibility\" for \"機構社會責任\" and \"sustainable organisation\" for \"可持續發展的機構.\" However, \"HKMA\" is sometimes preceded by \"The\" unnecessarily, which is not required in English unless it's part of a title or formal address.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations vary in fluency. For example, the first and third translations use \"fulfills this commitment in various areas,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly repetitive. The fourth and fifth translations use \"promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets,\" which is more precise than \"sustainable and environmentally conscious markets.\"\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The use of \"broader community\" versus \"wider community\" or \"broader society\" is a matter of style, but \"broader community\" is more commonly used in such contexts. \"Friendly work environment\" is standard, but \"friendly workplace\" or \"friendly working environment\" are also acceptable.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they maintain the formal tone expected in institutional communications.\n**Reasoning for Improvement**: The best translation should use \"HKMA\" without \"The\" unless it's part of a title, use \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" with a capital letter as it is a proper noun in this context, and ensure that the phrasing is fluent and natural. It should also use \"broader community\" and \"friendly work environment\" for consistency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nHKMA is committed to fulfilling Corporate Social Responsibility, with the goal of becoming a responsible and sustainable organisation. HKMA fulfills this commitment in various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for the broader community, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly work environment.\n\nTo address the original text, all six translations are largely accurate and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and either \"COVID-19 pandemic\" or \"COVID-19\" for \"新冠病毒疫情,\" adhering to the dictionary requirements.\n- The use of phrases like \"support individuals and businesses in need\" is consistent and accurate.\n- The verbs \"introduced,\" \"launched,\" and \"address\" are all appropriate, though \"address\" may be slightly less direct than \"respond to\" or \"cope with.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The phrase \"thereby helping Hong Kong's economy weather the crisis\" (Translation 1) is fluent but slightly less precise than \"navigate through difficult times\" or \"overcome these difficulties.\"\n- \"Weather the difficulties\" (Translation 2) is grammatically correct but slightly awkward compared to \"navigate through difficult times.\"\n- \"Navigate through difficult times\" (Translation 3) is more idiomatic and natural in English.\n- \"Through the difficult period\" (Translation 4) is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"navigate through difficult times.\"\n- \"Overcome these difficulties\" (Translation 5) is natural but slightly more specific than the original, which uses \"渡過難關\" (get through the difficult period).\n- \"Overcome difficulties\" (Translation 6) is concise but lacks the nuance of \"get through the difficult period.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, fluency, and idiomatic expression. \"Navigate through difficult times\" (Translation 3) is idiomatic and natural, while \"launched a number of measures\" (Translation 5) is more active than \"introduced\" or \"has introduced.\" Combining these elements, the improved translation should use \"launched\" for a more active tone and \"navigate through difficult times\" for a natural and idiomatic expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA has launched a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping Hong Kong's economy navigate through difficult times.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the sustainability of the world economy. As an important part of society, the financial sector is inevitably affected; and as part of the financial sector, banks should be more proactive in managing climate risks. In this regard, the HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge and is implementing a number of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include a three-phased approach to advancing the development of green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common assessment framework with the industry to evaluate the current \"greenness baseline\" of banks, as well as collaborate with international organisations to provide technical support to Hong Kong banks.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsulting with the industry and other stakeholders on supervisory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Phase Three\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\nThe original phrase \"集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度\" contains the key term \"落實、審視及評估,\" which must be translated using one of the provided alternatives: \"monitoring and evaluation\" or \"implementation.\" The phrase as a whole emphasizes the need to focus on the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of banks' progress in a specific area.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Concentrate on the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the progress of banks in this area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"implementation, monitoring, and evaluation\" as per the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Progress of banks\" is slightly awkward; \"banks' progress\" is more natural. Also, \"this area\" is slightly vague compared to \"this regard.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the bank's progress in this area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"implementation, monitoring and evaluation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The bank's progress\" implies a single bank, whereas the original likely refers to banks in general. Also, \"this area\" is less precise than \"this regard.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the bank’s progress in this regard.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"implementation, monitoring and evaluation\" and \"this regard\" effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The bank’s progress\" again implies a single bank, which may not be the intended meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Concentrate on the monitoring and evaluation of the bank's progress in this area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"monitoring and evaluation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits \"implementation,\" which is part of the original term. Also, \"the bank's progress\" is too specific.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Focus on monitoring and evaluation of the banks' progress in this area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"monitoring and evaluation\" and \"banks' progress\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits \"implementation,\" which is part of the original term. Also, \"this area\" is less precise than \"this regard.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Same as the fifth, so the same evaluation applies.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe original phrase includes the term \"落實、審視及評估,\" which should be translated as \"implementation, monitoring, and evaluation\" to fully capture the intended meaning. The phrase \"銀行在這方面的進度\" should be translated as \"the banks' progress in this regard\" to reflect the general reference to banks and the specific context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFocus on the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the banks' progress in this regard.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA participates in multiple international organisations, including the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Interest Group on Sustainable Finance under the Working Group on Banking Supervision of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. Through participation in these international organisations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the efforts of the central banking and regulatory community in addressing climate change, and can draw on the experiences and perspectives of other regions when developing local frameworks.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in terminology, structure, and clarity. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately translate the key terms from the dictionary, such as \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" and \"氣候相關風險\" as \"climate-related risks.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all translations.\n- The use of \"workstream\" is consistent, which is appropriate for the context of working groups within a network like the NGFS.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"workstream\" inconsistently. For example, in Translation 3, \"microprudential and supervision\" is used without \"workstream,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preferred term \"workstream on microprudential and supervision.\"\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Some translations use vague phrasing, such as \"related research work\" (Translation 3) or \"related research activities\" (Translation 2), which could be more precise by using \"relevant research\" or \"conducting relevant research.\"\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"which are currently not available\" (Translation 1) or \"which are currently not held\" (Translation 3), which can be simplified to \"currently unavailable.\"\n- **Use of Abbreviations:** While some translations include abbreviations like \"WS1\" and \"WS2,\" others omit them. The dictionary provides both the full name and the abbreviation, so including both (e.g., \"microprudential and supervision (WS1)\") adds clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in terminology by using \"workstream on [term]\" for all groups.\n- Use precise and concise language, avoiding redundancy.\n- Include both the full name and abbreviation for workstreams where appropriate.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated exactly as specified.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of all versions while addressing the weaknesses, ensuring clarity, precision, and consistency.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA is also participating in multiple workstreams under the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), including the workstream on microprudential and supervision (WS1), the workstream on macrofinancial (WS2), and the workstream on scaling up green finance (WS3). In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established workstreams: the workstream on research and the workstream on bridging the data gap. The workstream on research is responsible for conducting relevant research, while the workstream on bridging the data gap aims to develop a comprehensive list of data items required by regulatory authorities and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, which are currently unavailable. Details of the HKMA's work in promoting green and sustainable banking during the year are set out in the Banking Stability chapter.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Alliance for Green Commercial Banks,\" \"peer-to-peer learning platform,\" and \"green finance agenda.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points are all covered.\n- The use of \"founding member\" and \"regional anchor\" is accurate in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"estimated $2.3 trillion\" instead of \"23 trillion,\" which is a significant numerical error.\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly states \"23 trillion\" instead of \"2.3 trillion,\" and also uses \"US$23 trillion\" without a decimal point, which is inconsistent with the original.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"USD 23 trillion\" and omits the decimal point, which is a critical error.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"USD23 trillion\" without a decimal point and also omits the \"estimated\" qualifier, which is important for precision.\n- **Translation 5** correctly uses \"USD 2.3 trillion\" and includes the \"estimated\" qualifier, which is accurate.\n- **Translation 2** also correctly uses \"estimated $2.3 trillion\" and includes the \"IFC-identified\" phrase, which adds clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct numerical value of \"2.3 trillion\" is used with the \"estimated\" qualifier.\n- Use \"International Finance Corporation (IFC)\" consistently when first mentioned.\n- Ensure that \"green commercial banks\" is used in lowercase unless it is a proper noun, as in the dictionary.\n- Maintain the structure of the numbered points (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) for clarity.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"identified by the IFC\" is included for precision.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), launched the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks in November to assist banks in emerging markets in developing strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional anchor of the alliance, the HKMA i) promotes the development of green commercial banks in global financial markets; ii) provides a peer-to-peer learning platform for commercial banks to acquire the necessary knowledge, tools, and business information to develop their own green finance road maps and transform into credible green banks; iii) facilitates communication and explores cutting-edge issues to advance the global green finance agenda; and iv) supports collaboration among alliance members and helps seize the estimated USD 2.3 trillion in green and climate-related investment opportunities in emerging markets identified by the IFC over the next 10 years.\n\nLocally, the HKMA collaborates with other financial regulators to coordinate the financial sector's measures to address climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing the Government Green Bond Programme, the HKMA has also jointly established the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group) with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to handle cross-sectoral regulatory and market development issues. Details of the HKMA's work this year in developing Hong Kong into a green and sustainable finance hub can be found in the \"International Financial Centre chapter.\"\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group\n\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial sector's measures to address climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government's climate strategy. The Steering Group was jointly established by the HKMA and the SFC in May, with other members including the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the steering group has set up two work streams: one responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory matters, and the other for coordinating cross-agency market development efforts.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, capitalization, and phrasing that affect fluency and consistency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. The term \"green and sustainable finance\" is correctly used in lowercase, and \"financial ecosystem\" is accurately translated. However, \"action plans\" is more standard than \"action outlines.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, but \"Green and sustainable finance\" is capitalized inconsistently. \"Steering Group\" is capitalized, which is acceptable, but \"financial ecosystem\" is correctly used. The phrase \"jointly build\" is slightly awkward compared to \"build.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: Similar to the first, but \"action outlines\" is less standard than \"action plans.\" The use of \"green and sustainable finance\" in lowercase is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"supervisory group\" instead of \"steering committee\" or \"task force,\" which is less common in this context. \"Green and sustainable finance\" is capitalized inconsistently. The phrase \"aiming to build\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"task force\" instead of \"steering committee,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context. \"Green and sustainable finance\" is capitalized, which is acceptable. \"Most urgent issues\" is slightly more direct than \"most pressing issues.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most consistent in terms of terminology and capitalization. \"Oversight Group\" is a valid term, though \"steering committee\" is more commonly used in this context. \"Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy\" is capitalized appropriately, and \"action plans\" is the most standard term.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"steering committee\" as it is the most common term for this type of group in financial policy contexts. \"Green and sustainable finance\" should be in lowercase unless it is the official title of a strategy or document. \"Financial ecosystem\" is correctly translated. \"Action plans\" is the most standard term. The phrase \"to build a greener and more sustainable future\" is more natural than \"to jointly build\" or \"aiming to build.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe steering committee released a green and sustainable finance strategy in December, proposing to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem from six aspects to build a greener and more sustainable future in the long term. The steering committee also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe original text describes an event where the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) held a meeting to establish a supervisory group, with Eddie Yue, the HKMA's Chief Executive, serving as one of the co-chairs. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nStrengths across the translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Eddie Yue\" for \"余偉文.\" Most translations also correctly identify the role of Eddie Yue as the Chief Executive of the HKMA. However, there are notable weaknesses in terms of fluency, grammatical structure, and the choice of terms for \"督導小組成立大會.\"\nThe term \"督導小組成立大會\" is best translated as \"inaugural meeting of the supervisory committee\" or \"founding meeting of the supervisory group.\" The term \"establishment meeting\" used in some translations is less idiomatic in English. Additionally, the phrase \"serving as co-chairman\" is more natural than \"serving as co-chair\" or \"serving as one of the co-chairs,\" though all are grammatically correct.\nThe placement of \"third from the right\" is also slightly inconsistent. Some translations use \"right three,\" which is less common in English and could be confusing. The phrase \"third from the right\" is more natural and widely understood.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"inaugural meeting of the supervisory committee,\" place \"third from the right\" correctly, and use \"co-chairman\" for consistency with the formal tone of the original text.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is:\nThe HKMA held the inaugural meeting of the supervisory committee, with Mr. Eddie Yue (third from the right), the Chief Executive of the HKMA, serving as co-chairman of the committee.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The oversight group released Hong Kong's Green and Sustainable Finance Strategic Plan and five main action frameworks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"strategic plan\" and \"sustainable finance\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Green\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's a proper noun. \"Action frameworks\" is less common than \"action plans\" or \"guidelines\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The supervisory group released Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five major action plans.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct terms from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Supervisory group\" is less precise than \"steering group\" or \"oversight group.\" \"Major action plans\" is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"action guidelines.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The steering group released Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action outlines.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"steering group,\" which is a common term for such committees.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Action outlines\" is vague and less standard than \"action plans\" or \"guidelines.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The supervisory group released Hong Kong’s green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action guidelines.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"guidelines,\" which is a natural term for policy frameworks.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Supervisory group\" is less precise than \"steering group.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Supervisory Group released Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action guidelines.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms and \"guidelines.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Supervisory Group\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's an official title.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The steering committee has released Hong Kong’s green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action plans.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"steering committee,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Has released\" is slightly more formal than \"released\" and may not match the tone of the original.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **\"Steering group\"** is more commonly used in policy and governance contexts than \"supervisory group\" or \"oversight group.\"\n- **\"Green and sustainable finance\"** should be lowercase unless it's a proper title.\n- **\"Strategic plan\"** is the correct term from the dictionary.\n- **\"Action guidelines\"** is more natural and precise than \"action frameworks\" or \"action outlines.\"\n- **\"Released\"** is more direct and matches the tone of the original sentence.\n### Final Translation:\nThe steering group released Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action guidelines.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\nFirst, the term \"環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素\" is listed in the dictionary with two possible translations: \"social and governance (ESG) factors\" and \"environmental.\" However, the full term \"environment, social, and governance (ESG)\" is the standard and most accurate translation. Translators 2 and 3 incorrectly omitted \"environmental\" and \"social\" respectively, which is a critical error. Translators 1, 4, 5, and 6 correctly used \"environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.\"\nSecond, the term \"負責任投資\" is listed with three possible translations: \"Responsible Investment,\" \"responsible investment,\" and \"RI.\" While all are acceptable, \"Responsible Investment\" with a capital \"R\" and \"I\" is more formal and appropriate in the context of an official statement by an institution like the HKMA. Translators 1, 4, and 5 used \"responsible investment\" with lowercase letters, which is less formal. Translators 3 and 6 used \"Responsible Investment\" correctly.\nThird, the term \"資產擁有人\" is correctly translated as \"asset owner\" in all translations. However, the term \"major asset owner\" or \"large asset owner\" is more natural in English than \"large-scale asset owner\" (used by translator 6), which is somewhat awkward.\nFourth, the phrase \"which will influence how its asset managers conduct their investment activities\" is repeated in several translations. While grammatically correct, it can be slightly refined for fluency and variety. For example, \"which will impact how its asset managers conduct their investment activities\" (used by translator 6) is a slight variation that adds nuance.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"Responsible Investment\" with proper capitalization, include the full ESG factors, and use natural phrasing such as \"major asset owner\" and \"impact how its asset managers conduct their investment activities.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is:\nThe HKMA supports Responsible Investment, which involves integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a major asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly focused on Responsible Investment, which will impact how its asset managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# HKMA beliefs\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) belief that emphasizing responsible investment and considering the long-term sustainability of investments will help achieve the Exchange Fund's investment goals and reduce ESG-related risks. The dictionary provides specific terms that must be translated exactly, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to this requirement.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"responsible investment\" in lowercase, which is acceptable. It uses \"Exchange Fund\" without \"THE\" in uppercase, which is also acceptable. However, \"ESG-related risks\" is translated as \"ESG-related risks,\" which is not in the dictionary. The dictionary specifies \"ESG-related matters,\" so this is a minor error.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Responsible Investment\" with a capital \"R\" and \"I,\" which is acceptable. It uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase, which is also acceptable. However, it incorrectly translates \"ESG-related risk\" as \"ESG-related matters,\" which is not a direct match for the term in the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Responsible Investment\" with capitalization and \"Exchange Fund\" without \"THE\" in uppercase. It also uses \"ESG-related matters\" as per the dictionary. The translation is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Similar to the third, but uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase. It also uses \"ESG-related matters\" correctly. The only difference is the capitalization of \"THE EXCHANGE FUND,\" which is acceptable but not necessary unless specified.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Similar to the fourth, but uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in uppercase and \"ESG-related matters\" correctly. The only difference is the placement of \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in the sentence, which is grammatically correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"responsible investment\" in lowercase, which is acceptable. It uses \"Exchange Fund\" without \"THE\" in uppercase. It also uses \"ESG-related matters\" correctly. However, it changes \"various investments\" to \"each investment,\" which slightly alters the meaning of the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" without \"The\" unless it's part of a title. It should use \"Exchange Fund\" without \"THE\" in uppercase unless specified. It should use \"Responsible Investment\" with capitalization to reflect the term's significance. It should use \"ESG-related matters\" as per the dictionary. The phrase \"various investments\" should remain unchanged to preserve the original meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing Responsible Investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce ESG-related matters involved in investment activities.\n\n# HKMA's Principles\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the HKMA, ESG investments are generally given priority when their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable to those of other investment projects. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA incorporates the Principles for Responsible Investment into its investment management process, adapting them according to circumstances.\n\n# Integrate\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional result.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"ESG\" for \"ESG,\" adhering to the dictionary requirements.\n- The core message—that ESG factors are important for long-term value and are being integrated into investment processes—is consistently conveyed.\n- The use of verbs such as \"incorporates,\" \"integrates,\" \"identify,\" \"seek,\" \"uncover,\" and \"seize\" reflects the nuances of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Consistency:** Some translations use \"incorporates\" in one sentence and \"integrates\" in another, which, while not incorrect, lacks consistency. It is preferable to use the same verb for parallel actions.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** \"Seek opportunities\" and \"seek out opportunities\" are slightly less idiomatic than \"identify opportunities\" or \"seize opportunities.\" \"Uncover opportunities\" is also acceptable but less commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Redundancy:** The phrase \"the management of public and private market investments\" is slightly wordy. A more concise version such as \"public and private market investments\" is preferable, as per the dictionary entry.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Maintain consistency in verb usage (e.g., use \"incorporates\" throughout).\n- Use \"identify opportunities\" as it is more standard in formal writing.\n- Use the dictionary's exact phrase \"public and private market investments\" to ensure alignment with the provided terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects, and therefore incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis process to identify risks and opportunities. The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into public and private market investments.\n\n# Active ownership\nThe original text is a single phrase: \"主動行使資產擁有權,\" which is directly mapped in the dictionary to \"Active ownership.\" All junior translators have correctly used this exact translation from the dictionary. However, their translations vary slightly in formatting:\n- The first, fifth, and sixth translators provided only the phrase \"Active ownership\" without any additional formatting.\n- The second, third, and fourth translators included a \"#\" symbol before the phrase, which may be an attempt to format it as a heading or title.\nGiven that the original text appears to be a title or heading (as suggested by the use of the \"#\" symbol in some translations), the most appropriate approach would be to retain the \"#\" symbol to maintain the intended formatting. However, since the original Traditional Chinese text does not include the \"#\" symbol, it is not strictly necessary unless the context explicitly requires it.\nThe best possible translation would be to use \"Active ownership\" as the direct translation, and if the context implies it should be a heading, then including the \"#\" symbol would be acceptable. Therefore, the most accurate and appropriately formatted translation would be:\n# Active ownership\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"safeguard the long-term value of its investments\" and \"external fund managers\" appropriately. However, \"investment portfolios\" is used in the last sentence, which is slightly different from the original's \"investment projects.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, but it uses \"maintain the long-term value of investments\" and \"external fund managers.\" It also uses \"investment projects\" in the last sentence, which is consistent with the original. However, the phrase \"fulfilling its ownership responsibilities for investment projects\" is slightly less natural than \"fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over investment projects.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"practice Active ownership\" with a capital \"A,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry that lists \"Active ownership\" with a lowercase \"a.\" It also uses \"investment projects\" and \"external managers\" (instead of \"external fund managers\"), which is acceptable but less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"exercise Active ownership\" with a capital \"A,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"external managers\" and \"investment projects,\" which are acceptable but not as precise as \"external fund managers\" and \"investment portfolios.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"safeguard the long-term value of its investments,\" \"external fund managers,\" and \"investment portfolios.\" It also correctly uses \"Active ownership\" with a lowercase \"a\" and avoids unnecessary capitalization. The only minor issue is the repetition of \"its\" in \"its public equity holdings\" and \"its investments.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is also strong but uses \"holdings of public equity holdings,\" which is redundant. It also uses \"investment projects\" instead of \"investment portfolios,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"Active ownership\" should be used with a lowercase \"a\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"External fund managers\" is more precise than \"external managers.\"\n- \"Investment portfolios\" is more appropriate than \"investment projects\" in the context of financial management.\n- The phrase \"fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over investment portfolios\" is more natural and precise than \"for investment projects.\"\n- The use of \"safeguard\" is more appropriate than \"maintain\" in the context of protecting long-term value.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA appropriately exercises its shareholder rights over its public equity holdings to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour, taking into account ESG factors, will help create long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects external fund managers to actively exercise ownership by exercising voting rights and engaging with investee companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over its investment portfolios.\n\n# Cooperation\nThe original text is simply the word \"合作\" (hézuò), which means \"cooperation\" or \"collaboration\" in English. The junior translators have provided several translations, most of which are accurate, though there are minor differences in nuance and formatting.\n1. **\"Cooperation\"** – This is a direct and accurate translation of \"合作.\" It is the most commonly used term in English for this context and is appropriate for general usage.\n2. **\"# Cooperation\"** – This includes a hashtag, which may be appropriate in certain contexts (e.g., social media or headings), but it is unnecessary here unless the original text was intended to be a heading or tag. Since the original text is just the word \"合作,\" the hashtag is an addition not supported by the source.\n3. **\"Cooperation\"** – Same as the first translation, accurate and appropriate.\n4. **\"# Cooperate\"** – This is less accurate. \"Cooperate\" is a verb, while \"合作\" is a noun. The hashtag is again an unnecessary addition.\n5. **\"Collaboration\"** – This is also a valid translation of \"合作,\" though it carries a slightly different nuance. \"Collaboration\" often implies a more joint or creative effort, while \"cooperation\" is more general. Both are correct, but \"cooperation\" is more commonly used in this context.\n6. **\"Collaboration\"** – Same as the fifth translation.\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**  \n\"Cooperation\" is the most natural and widely accepted translation of \"合作\" in general contexts. It is concise, accurate, and does not include any unnecessary formatting like hashtags. While \"collaboration\" is also correct, it is slightly more specific and may not be the best fit unless the context clearly implies a joint effort or project. Since the original text is simply the word \"合作,\" the best translation is \"Cooperation.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"responsible investment approach,\" which is acceptable, though \"principles\" or \"concept\" might be more precise in this context. The use of \"more refined ESG practices\" is slightly vague compared to the original's \"更完善的ESG作業手法.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"responsible investment concept,\" which is appropriate. However, \"more refined ESG practices\" is again slightly less precise than \"更完善的ESG作業手法.\"\n3. **Translation 3** has a minor grammatical issue with the use of \"and also attended\" instead of \"and also participates\" to maintain tense consistency. It uses \"Responsible Investment\" with a capital \"R,\" which is acceptable but less common in formal writing unless referring to a specific framework.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Investment management\" with a capital \"I,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase version. It also uses \"Responsible Investment principles,\" which is a good choice, though \"principles\" may be slightly broader than the original's \"理念.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Responsible Investment principles,\" which is appropriate. However, \"more comprehensive ESG practices\" is slightly different from the original's \"更完善的ESG作業手法.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is the most precise in terms of vocabulary and structure. It uses \"ESG operational approaches\" to capture \"作業手法\" more accurately. It also uses \"principles of responsible investment,\" which is a natural and precise rendering of \"負責任投資理念.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should aim for a balance between accuracy, fluency, and natural English expression. The original text emphasizes the HKMA's efforts to promote sound investment management, share improved ESG practices, and encourage responsible investment. The term \"作業手法\" is best translated as \"operational approaches\" to reflect the practical implementation of ESG principles. \"負責任投資理念\" is best rendered as \"principles of responsible investment\" to capture the conceptual and guiding nature of the term. The use of \"HKMA\" with a lowercase \"h\" is standard in formal writing unless referring to the official name.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulatory authorities to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also participates in public events and delivers speeches to share improved ESG operational approaches and encourage the investment community to adopt the principles of responsible investment.\n\nFor details on the HKMA's work on responsible investment this year, see the Reserves Management chapter.\n\n# HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external fund managers.\n\n# HKMA's Expectations\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the HKMA emphasizes the integration of ESG factors and active ownership in its investment management practices. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and the use of specific terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"public equity holdings,\" \"external fund managers,\" \"shareholder rights,\" \"ESG,\" and \"Active ownership.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and aligns with the original meaning.\n- The use of terms like \"active ownership\" and \"ESG factors\" is consistent with the dictionary and the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the concept of active ownership\" and \"take active ownership seriously,\" which is slightly repetitive and less fluent.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"fundamental policy\" instead of \"fundamental principle,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"concepts such as Active ownership\" and \"take Active ownership seriously,\" which is inconsistent in capitalization and slightly less natural.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"actively exercising asset ownership\" and \"publicly listed equities,\" which are not exact matches to the dictionary terms and may be less precise.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"actively exercising ownership\" and \"maintaining the long-term value,\" which is slightly less precise than \"safeguarding\" or \"preserving.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"will consider\" and \"will require,\" which introduces a future tense not present in the original, slightly altering the nuance.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"integrating\" or \"incorporating\" consistently with \"ESG factors into investment decisions.\"\n- Use \"external fund managers\" or \"external managers\" consistently.\n- Use \"public equity holdings\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"shareholder rights\" as specified.\n- Use \"Active ownership\" with consistent capitalization.\n- Use \"fundamental principle\" or \"basic approach\" for the concept of long-term value preservation.\n- Avoid introducing future tense unless explicitly stated in the original.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA places great emphasis on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and the concept of Active ownership. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external fund managers. Since the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights over its public equity holdings is a fundamental principle for safeguarding the long-term value of its investments, it requires appointed external managers to take Active ownership seriously.\n\n# HKMA's Oversight\n\nExternal fund managers must be assessed on the ESG performance of the listed equity portfolios they manage for the HKMA. The HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of external fund managers across different areas through a communication plan, such as their ESG assessment framework, communication with investee companies, and work related to proxy voting. In 2020, the HKMA selected several external fund managers to pilot the communication plan, which not only assessed their ESG performance but also examined whether they had properly exercised asset ownership on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThe original text discusses how the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) identifies problematic external investment managers through a program and takes follow-up actions, with two examples provided. The translations by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and word choice.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"external fund managers\" or \"external managers\" is used consistently for \"外聘投資經理.\"\n- The core meaning of identifying problematic managers and taking follow-up actions is preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and aspect:** Some translations use the past tense (\"identified,\" \"took\") while others use the present tense (\"identifies,\" \"takes\"). The original text uses the present tense, suggesting an ongoing process, so the present tense is more appropriate.\n- **Word choice:** \"Operational practices\" is more natural than \"operational methods\" or \"operational procedures\" in this context.\n- **\"Through the program\" vs. \"through the scheme\":** \"Program\" is more commonly used in regulatory or institutional contexts than \"scheme.\"\n- **\"The following are two examples\" vs. \"The following examples illustrate two of them\":** The former is more concise and natural in English.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the present tense to reflect the ongoing nature of the HKMA's actions.\n- Use \"operational practices\" for \"作業手法.\"\n- Use \"program\" instead of \"scheme.\"\n- Use \"The following are two examples\" for clarity and conciseness.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA identifies external fund managers with problematic operational practices through the program and takes follow-up actions. The following are two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"equity securities investment manager\" and \"investee companies\" correctly. The structure is clear, and the use of \"followed up with A on this matter\" is natural. However, \"the determination to accelerate the implementation of reforms\" is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"corporate policies\" instead of \"company policies,\" which is acceptable. The use of \"has followed up\" and \"has conducted\" is slightly more formal, but still natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"assess investee companies\" and \"corporate policies\" correctly. However, \"newly established\" is slightly awkward compared to \"established a new.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is concise and accurate. It uses \"equity securities manager\" instead of \"equity securities investment manager,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"the ESG process\" instead of \"ESG procedures,\" which is acceptable but less specific.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"companies in which they invest\" instead of \"investee companies,\" which is a valid alternative. However, \"specially appointed\" is less common than \"specifically appointed.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version has a grammatical error in \"should establish a more systematic approach,\" which is incorrect in this context. It should be \"particularly in establishing.\" It also uses \"opinions on ESG procedures\" and \"showing the commitment\" which are slightly less formal than the other translations.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should avoid awkward phrasing and maintain a formal yet natural tone. Based on the above review, the first and second translations are the most accurate and fluent. However, the first translation uses \"followed up with A on this matter\" which is slightly more natural than \"has followed up with A on this matter.\" The second translation uses \"corporate policies\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\nThe best possible translation would combine the strengths of the first and second translations, using \"equity securities investment manager,\" \"investee companies,\" and \"corporate policies\" where appropriate, while maintaining a natural and fluent structure.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA noted that the ESG framework of equity securities investment manager A had room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic approach to evaluating investee companies. The HKMA followed up with A on this matter, after which A conducted a comprehensive review of its corporate policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A also specifically appointed an external consultant to provide advice on ESG procedures, reflecting its determination to accelerate the implementation of reforms. Additionally, A established a new ESG committee composed of senior management, demonstrating its commitment to ESG and the support of senior management for these measures.\n\n# Case 2\n\nAfter reviewing the six translations, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"equity securities,\" \"voting policy,\" \"proxy voting guidelines,\" \"ESG team members,\" and \"Head of ESG.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically correct, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly less precise verbs, such as \"review\" instead of \"conduct a review\" or \"review it\" instead of \"conduct a review of it.\"\n- The phrase \"in several areas\" is used in some translations, while \"in multiple areas\" is used in others. Both are acceptable, but \"multiple\" is more precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"which included\" in the first translation is slightly less direct than \"including\" used in others.\n- The use of \"in cases involving\" versus \"on\" or \"when facing\" introduces slight variations in tone and formality, though all are acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"conduct a review of\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"multiple areas\" for precision.\n- Use \"including\" instead of \"which included\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"in cases involving\" for formality and clarity.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, precision, and formality while using the most accurate and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAfter reviewing the voting methods of equity securities investment manager B, the HKMA found that B's voting policy had deficiencies in multiple areas and requested that its Head of ESG conduct a review of it. In particular, B had previously voted in favor of all management proposals, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening its voting policy to meet expectations, including increasing the involvement of ESG team members and potentially voting against management in cases involving significant governance issues.\n\nIn the private equity market, the HKMA, through its general partners, collaborates with relevant portfolio companies on ESG matters to achieve responsible investment. The HKMA has noted that general partners consistently take on ESG responsibilities, as they believe this approach can help create long-term value for portfolio companies and ensure the sustainability of returns. The following two examples demonstrate how (i) design modifications and the use of innovative operational technologies; and (ii) integrating carbon reduction factors into the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses can help manage climate change risks. Both examples have a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions, avoiding harmful substances, and simultaneously improving operational efficiency by reducing costs and saving energy.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" \"法律服務\" as \"legal services,\" \"低碳行業\" as \"low-carbon-emitting sectors,\" \"碳排放\" as \"carbon emissions,\" and \"軟件出版\" as \"software publishing.\" This is a strong point, as it ensures consistency with the specified terminology.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are well-structured and natural-sounding in English. However, some variations in vocabulary and phrasing may affect the tone and clarity. For example, \"biocidal agent-free approach\" (Translation 2) is slightly more technical than \"biocides\" (Translation 1), which may be more accessible to a general audience. Similarly, \"dynamic sensors\" (Translation 1) is more precise than \"dynamic sensors connected to the internet\" (Translation 3), which is slightly redundant.\nThe phrase \"net carbon emission effect\" (Translation 2) is slightly awkward compared to \"net carbon emissions\" (Translation 1) or \"net carbon footprint\" (Translation 5), which are more commonly used in environmental contexts. Additionally, \"perfect route planning\" (Translation 6) is a bit hyperbolic, whereas \"efficient route planning\" (Translation 1) or \"optimized route planning\" (Translation 5) are more neutral and appropriate.\nThe phrase \"which is indeed encouraging\" (Translation 1) is slightly more formal than \"which is truly encouraging\" (Translation 3 and 6), but both are acceptable. However, \"which is truly encouraging\" may be more impactful in a formal context.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions, using precise and natural language while maintaining the specified terminology. It should avoid redundancy, use commonly accepted environmental terminology, and maintain a balanced tone.\n(i) The HKMA has invested in a pest control company that adopts environmentally friendly solutions. Although traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively kill pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of dead pests can pose a risk to public health. In addition, leakage and disposal of chemical substances can also cause environmental problems. The company's approach, which avoids the use of biocides, reduces the use of harmful chemicals by setting up traps. It also uses dynamic sensors connected to the internet to remotely monitor whether pests have been captured. With this new technology, the company can make efficient route planning for collecting captured pests, reducing travel distance and thus lowering carbon emissions. The company's approach results in a low level of net carbon emissions, at 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales, which is close to the average level of low-carbon-emitting sectors such as legal services and software publishing, which is truly encouraging.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"green and sustainable warehouses,\" \"net zero carbon process,\" \"carbon-efficient,\" \"solar thermal systems,\" \"electric vehicle charging portals,\" \"rainwater harvesting,\" and \"carbon emissions.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of technical terms from the dictionary.\n- Clear and coherent structure that mirrors the original Chinese.\n- Proper use of grammar and sentence flow in English.\n- Consistent use of terms like \"natural lighting\" or \"natural daylighting,\" which are both acceptable, though \"natural lighting\" is more commonly used in technical contexts.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"have adopted\" while others use \"adopted,\" which is a minor stylistic choice but should be consistent.\n- The phrase \"establish standards and metrics to measure net zero carbon benchmarks\" is slightly awkward in some translations. A smoother phrasing would be \"establish standards and metrics for measuring net zero carbon benchmarks.\"\n- The use of \"natural daylighting\" in some translations is slightly less common than \"natural lighting\" in the context of building features.\n- The verb tense in the first sentence varies between \"has invested\" and \"invests,\" which should be consistent with the original Chinese, which uses the present perfect tense (\"有投資\").\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the present perfect tense (\"has invested\"), use \"natural lighting\" for consistency with common usage, and ensure that the phrasing of \"establish standards and metrics for measuring net zero carbon benchmarks\" is smooth and natural.\nFinal Translation:\n(ii) The HKMA has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted a net zero carbon process in their overall warehouse construction and operation, and have established standards and metrics for measuring net zero carbon benchmarks. The building plans also take into account the sustainability of the materials and components used. Therefore, the warehouses constructed are carbon-efficient and feature sustainable characteristics, including solar thermal systems, electric vehicle charging portals, natural lighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent consultant’s assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse construction, on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than that of a typical logistics building. To further offset the carbon emissions generated by the construction project, 32,799 trees were planted during the construction process (on a net basis). Once completed, the warehouse’s daily operational carbon emissions are 26.9% lower than those of a typical warehouse.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第187至289頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US Treasury

These financial statements include THE EXCHANGE FUND and the Group's balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, and the income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and statements of cash flows for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have fairly and accurately reflected the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2020, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six translations provided. All translations are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology that can be improved.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"Chief Executive,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"Audit Commission auditing standards,\" \"financial statements,\" and \"audit evidence.\" All translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for an audit report.\nWeaknesses include minor grammatical issues and variations in phrasing that affect fluency. For example, the first junior translator uses \"in relation to the audit of the financial statements\" which is correct but slightly wordy. The second junior translator uses \"support my audit opinion\" which is slightly less formal than \"provide a basis for my audit opinion.\" The third junior translator uses \"Article 7\" instead of \"section 7,\" which is a minor but notable difference in legal terminology. The fourth junior translator uses \"the section of this report, 'The auditor's responsibilities relating to the audit of the financial statements'\" which is slightly awkward in structure. The fifth junior translator uses \"directions\" instead of \"instructions,\" which is a synonym but not the exact term used in the original. The sixth junior translator uses \"the Audit Commission's auditing standards\" with an extra possessive's, which is not necessary and slightly changes the phrasing.\nIn terms of fluency and natural English expression, the second and sixth translations are the most polished. The second translation uses \"support my audit opinion\" which is concise and natural. The sixth translation uses \"as required by these standards\" which is slightly more precise than \"in accordance with these standards.\"\nConsidering all these factors, the best possible translation would retain the formal tone, use the exact dictionary terms, and ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are the most significant matters in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the audit and formation of my opinion on the entire financial statements, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information in the Monetary Authority's 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of two entities—the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee—with respect to financial statements. The junior translators have produced several versions, but each has notable issues in terms of clarity, grammatical structure, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with respect to the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains a formal tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as the Audit Sub-Committee being under both the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which is not accurate. The original text implies two separate Audit Sub-Committees under each entity.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee bear responsibilities regarding the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses correct terms and is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The subject is unclear. It suggests that both the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the EFAC bear responsibility, but the original text refers to the Audit Sub-Committee under each entity.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s responsibilities regarding the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses correct terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The possessive form (\"Committee’s\") is awkward and changes the meaning. It implies the responsibilities belong to the Committee, not the entities.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Monetary Authority regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms and is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure implies that the Audit Sub-Committee under the EFAC and the Monetary Authority are both responsible, but the original text refers to the Audit Sub-Committee under each entity.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's responsibilities regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses correct terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the third translation, the possessive form is awkward and changes the meaning.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Responsibility of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The singular \"responsibility\" may not fully capture the plural nature of the responsibilities described in the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe original text refers to two distinct Audit Sub-Committees: one under the Monetary Authority and one under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The best translation should clearly distinguish these two entities and use the correct dictionary terms. It should also use the plural form \"responsibilities\" to match the original text's tone and meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and the use of specific terms that can be refined for clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants,\" \"Chief Executive,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" and \"financial statements.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"material misstatements resulting from fraud or error\" is accurate and commonly used in financial reporting contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations, such as the third and fourth, use phrases like \"must be responsible for preparing\" or \"must be responsible for preparing... and implementing,\" which are slightly redundant. A more concise phrasing like \"must prepare... and implement\" is preferable.\n- **Variation in phrasing:** The use of \"directions,\" \"instructions,\" and \"given\" introduces slight variation in tone. \"Instructions\" is more formal and commonly used in legal or regulatory contexts, making it the most appropriate choice.\n- **Clarity of responsibility:** The first and second translations use \"is responsible for preparing... and for implementing,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than \"must prepare... and implement.\"\n- **Punctuation and flow:** The third and fourth translations use parentheses and additional commas, which can disrupt the flow of the sentence. A more streamlined structure is preferable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"must prepare\" instead of \"is responsible for preparing\" to emphasize the obligation more clearly.\n- Use \"instructions\" instead of \"directions\" or \"given\" for consistency and formality.\n- Avoid redundancy by using concise phrasing.\n- Ensure that the sentence flows smoothly without unnecessary punctuation or repetition.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority must prepare true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and implement the internal controls it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority must assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern and, where applicable, disclose matters related to the going concern, and adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is straightforward and formal, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately. The primary differences between the translations lie in the choice of verbs (\"overseeing\" vs. \"supervising\") and minor stylistic choices such as the capitalization of \"Group\" and punctuation (apostrophe in \"group's\").\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" is translated as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"審核委員會\" as \"Audit Sub-Committee.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across all translations, maintaining the formal tone appropriate for an official statement.\n- The use of \"overseeing\" or \"supervising\" is contextually appropriate, though \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal or official contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The verb \"supervising\" in the second translation is slightly less formal and less commonly used in official or corporate contexts compared to \"overseeing.\"\n- The capitalization of \"Group\" in the third translation is inconsistent with the rest, which may be a stylistic choice but could be misleading if \"Group\" refers to a specific entity.\n- The punctuation (apostrophe in \"group's\") is consistent across all translations, but the use of \"Group’s\" with an apostrophe is more formal and appropriate in official documents.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Overseeing\" is the more natural and formal choice in this context.\n- \"Group’s\" with an apostrophe is more appropriate for formal writing.\n- Consistency in capitalization and punctuation is important for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor's Responsibility in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Audit Commission auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements arising from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated by the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the period, thereby constituting key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public interest, and therefore decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nDirector of Audit  \nZhu Nai-zhang  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text consists of two lines: the first is the title \"審計署署長,\" and the second is the name \"朱乃璋.\" The dictionary specifies that \"審計署署長\" must be translated as \"Director of Audit.\" All junior translators correctly used this term, which is a strength.\nHowever, the translations differ in how they rendered the name \"朱乃璋.\" The correct transliteration of this name into English is crucial for accuracy and cultural appropriateness. The name \"朱乃璋\" is composed of three characters: 朱 (Zhu), 乃 (Nai), and 璋 (Zhang). The correct pinyin is \"Zhu Nai-zhang,\" with the surname \"Zhu\" and the given name \"Nai-zhang.\" \nSome junior translators used \"Zhu Nai-chang\" (e.g., first and fourth translators), which incorrectly transcribes the final character 璋 as \"chang\" instead of \"zhang.\" Others used \"Zhu Nai Zhang\" (e.g., second, third, fifth, and sixth translators), which omits the hyphen or diacritic that indicates the correct pronunciation of 璋 as \"zhang\" (with a \"z\" sound, not \"zh\" or \"ch\"). \nThe most accurate and fluent rendering is \"Zhu Nai-zhang,\" which preserves the correct pronunciation and structure of the name. It is also important to maintain consistency in formatting—placing the title on one line and the name on the next, as in the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nDirector of Audit  \nZhu Nai-zhang\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\n# 1 Principal Activities\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66)\" as per the dictionary. However, the phrase \"under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary in its capacity as the manager of the Exchange Fund\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and fluent. It uses \"exercises powers conferred upon it by the Financial Secretary as the manager of the Exchange Fund,\" which is a natural phrasing. It also uses \"soundness\" instead of \"integrity\" for \"穩定健全,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"integrity\" in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"THE EXCHANGE FUND\" in all caps as per the dictionary. However, the phrase \"acting in the capacity of manager of THE EXCHANGE FUND (the Fund) as empowered by the Financial Secretary\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"Cap. 66\" for the ordinance, which is acceptable but less common than \"Chapter 66.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses \"Fund Manager of THE EXCHANGE FUND\" as per the dictionary. However, \"Fund Manager\" is not a standard title for the Financial Secretary in this context, and \"in his capacity as Fund Manager\" is slightly misleading.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"head of the Exchange Fund\" instead of \"manager,\" which is not an exact match for the dictionary term. It also uses \"soundness\" again, which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The phrase \"exercises powers conferred upon it by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the manager of the Exchange Fund\" from Translation 2 is the most natural and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"Chapter 66\" is more standard than \"Cap. 66.\"\n- The phrase \"safeguarding the exchange value of the currency and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems\" from Translation 1 is the most precise and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority exercises powers conferred upon it by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the manager of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of terminology consistency, grammatical precision, and stylistic nuance. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and concise, using \"the Backing Portfolio\" and \"the Strategic Portfolio\" consistently. It correctly uses \"Currency Board system\" and \"Monetary Base\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"shares\" instead of \"equity securities\" for \"股票,\" which is less precise in a financial context.\n2. **Translation 2** is well-structured and uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" as an alternative to \"Currency Board system,\" which is acceptable. It also uses \"equity securities\" for \"股票,\" which is more precise. However, it uses \"the Fund’s accounts\" instead of \"the fund's accounts,\" which is a minor inconsistency in article usage.\n3. **Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" and \"equity securities\" correctly. It also uses \"the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government\" consistently. However, it uses \"data\" instead of \"information\" for \"資料,\" which is slightly less natural in this context.\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 1, with the same minor issue of using \"shares\" instead of \"equity securities.\" It is otherwise accurate and consistent.\n5. **Translation 5** is well-written and uses \"equity securities\" correctly. It also includes the full name of OECD in parentheses, which is good for clarity. However, it uses \"the Fund’s accounts\" and \"operating segment\" without the definite article, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Operating segment.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses \"equity securities\" and \"Currency Board system\" correctly. It also uses \"accounted for in the fund's books,\" which is slightly more formal than \"included in the fund's accounts.\" However, it uses \"operating segments\" instead of \"operating segment,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should maintain consistency with the dictionary, use precise financial terminology, and ensure grammatical accuracy and natural flow. Based on the above review, the best elements from each translation can be combined to produce a refined version that is both accurate and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fund's assets are managed across four distinct portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's Currency Board system, the assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds equity securities of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for strategic purposes and are included in the fund's accounts. Information on the operating segment is presented in Note 32.\n\n# 2 Main Accounting Policies\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThis financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (which is a comprehensive term encompassing all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards, and interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\") is set out below.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. It uses \"took effect for the first time in the group's current accounting period\" and \"available for early adoption,\" which are accurate. However, \"these financial statements\" is slightly vague; \"these\" could be replaced with \"the\" for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the ideal. It uses \"amended\" instead of \"revised,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in financial contexts. The phrase \"have been reflected in these financial statements\" is more formal and precise than \"are reflected.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second, but it uses \"for the current and prior accounting periods (if any)\" which is slightly awkward. The phrase \"resulting from the initial adoption\" is accurate but could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is clear and concise. It uses \"certain\" instead of \"several,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"Any changes in accounting policies for the current and prior accounting periods resulting from the Group's first adoption of the applicable standards\" is slightly wordy but still accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"have taken effect for the first time or are available for early adoption in this accounting period of the group,\" which is slightly awkward in structure. The phrase \"related information is provided in note 3\" is slightly less formal than \"disclosed in Note 3.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very precise and uses \"reporting period\" instead of \"accounting period,\" which is acceptable but slightly different in nuance. The phrase \"Information regarding these changes is disclosed in Note 3\" is very formal and appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\" (not \"HKFRSs\") for clarity and formality.\n- \"Revised\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"amended.\"\n- \"Accounting period\" is more standard than \"reporting period\" in financial reporting.\n- \"Disclosed in Note 3\" is the most formal and appropriate phrasing.\n- The phrase \"resulting from the Group’s first-time adoption\" is more concise and natural than \"resulting from the Group's first adoption.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued several new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which became effective for the first time in the Group's current accounting period or are available for early adoption. Changes in accounting policies resulting from the Group’s first-time adoption of applicable standards in the current and prior accounting periods (if any) are reflected in the financial statements, with the relevant information disclosed in Note 3.\n\n# 2.2 Basis for Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe original text discusses the composition of group financial statements and references the disclosure of principal activities of key entities in the notes. The dictionary provides precise translations for specific terms, which must be used exactly as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"subsidiaries\" for \"附屬公司\" and includes all required terms. However, it adds \"its\" before \"subsidiaries,\" which is not in the original text and may be unnecessary.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate but omits \"subsidiaries\" from the list of entities in the first sentence, which is a mistake. It also uses \"principal subsidiaries\" instead of \"major subsidiaries,\" which is not a direct match for \"主要附屬公司.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"major subsidiaries\" and \"disclosed\" for \"載於.\" However, \"disclosed\" may be slightly less precise than \"set out\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"main subsidiaries\" instead of \"major subsidiaries,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary's \"主要附屬公司\" (which maps to \"major subsidiaries\"). \"Main\" is not an exact match.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"major subsidiaries\" and \"set out\" for \"載於.\" It also avoids the unnecessary \"its\" used in the first translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"main subsidiaries\" instead of \"major subsidiaries,\" which is a minor deviation. It also uses \"disclosed\" for \"載於,\" which is slightly less precise than \"set out.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"subsidiaries\" for \"附屬公司,\" \"associates\" for \"聯營公司,\" \"joint ventures\" for \"合營公司,\" \"principal activities\" for \"主要業務.\"\n- Use \"set out\" for \"載於\" as it is more precise in the context of financial reporting.\n- Avoid unnecessary additions like \"its\" before \"subsidiaries.\"\n- Use \"major subsidiaries\" for \"主要附屬公司\" as it is the most accurate match.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe group financial statements include the financial statements of the group, as well as the group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the major subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are set out in Notes 17 and 18.\n\nThe original text outlines the basis of financial statement preparation, specifying that most assets and liabilities are measured using historical cost, with exceptions measured at fair value. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing and some minor grammatical or stylistic issues.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"prepared on a historical cost basis,\" which is natural in financial contexts. The structure is fluent and adheres to the dictionary terms.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** Similar to the first, but uses \"preparation basis of these financial statements is based on historical cost measurement.\" While accurate, the phrasing is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This version is very similar to the first and is also grammatically sound. It uses \"the basis for preparing these financial statements is historical cost,\" which is concise and natural.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This translation has a critical error: \"Financial assets and financial liabilities fair value through income and expenditure account\" is grammatically incorrect. It should be \"measured at fair value through income and expenditure account.\" Additionally, \"using fair value measurement\" is redundant and awkward.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"prepared on a historical cost basis,\" which is standard in financial reporting. The structure is clear and adheres to the dictionary terms.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** Similar to the second, but uses \"the basis of preparation of these financial statements is measured using historical cost,\" which is slightly awkward. The phrase \"measured using historical cost\" is not standard in financial reporting.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard financial terminology. The fifth junior translator's version is the most accurate and natural, with the correct use of \"prepared on a historical cost basis\" and proper application of the dictionary terms. It avoids redundancy and maintains a clear, professional tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value:  \n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);  \n- Gold (Note 2.10); and  \n- Investment properties (Note 2.11).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"financial statements,\" \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" and \"accounting policies.\" Each version conveys the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the role of management judgment, estimates, and assumptions in financial reporting under HKFRS.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and professional tone appropriate for financial reporting.\n- Proper structure and flow of ideas.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"judging\" instead of \"determining\" or \"assessing,\" which may be less precise in a financial context.\n- The phrase \"in the absence of other readily available data\" is used in several translations, which is correct, but \"readily available\" could be simplified to \"available\" without losing meaning.\n- The phrase \"the estimated results may differ from actual values\" is slightly repetitive and could be more concise, such as \"the estimates may differ from actual values.\"\nImprovements could focus on:\n- Ensuring consistent use of precise financial terminology.\n- Simplifying where possible without sacrificing clarity.\n- Ensuring that the sentence structure is varied to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and precision of the original, use the required terminology accurately, and ensure natural, fluent English.\nPreparing financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions, which affect the adoption of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the circumstances. In the absence of other available data, these estimates and assumptions are used as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The estimates may differ from actual values.\n\nThese translations are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, precision, and grammatical structure that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the core message: estimates and assumptions are reviewed and revised, and the recognition of revisions depends on whether they affect the current period only or both the current and future periods.\n- The use of terms like \"accounting period\" and \"revisions\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and logical.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use redundant phrasing, such as \"the revisions will be recognized within that period\" or \"the related revisions will be recognized within that period,\" which can be simplified.\n- The phrase \"the revisions made only affect\" in translations 2 and 5 is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for smoother flow.\n- The use of \"such revisions\" in translation 3 is repetitive and could be replaced with \"the revisions\" for consistency.\n- The phrase \"in the current period and future periods accordingly\" in translation 4 is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more concise phrasing, such as \"revisions will be recognized in that period\" instead of \"the revisions will be recognized within that period.\"\n- Ensure parallel structure in both clauses, such as using \"in that period\" and \"in those periods\" for consistency.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"the revisions\" consistently rather than \"such revisions\" or \"the related revisions.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions affect only the current accounting period, they will be recognized in that period. However, if the revisions affect both the current and future accounting periods, they will be recognized in that period and in future periods.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal financial statement disclosure, emphasizing the sources of uncertainty in management's judgments and estimates related to the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), and how these affect the financial statements. The sentence structure is complex, and the translations provided by junior translators vary in clarity, accuracy, and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. It accurately reflects the original meaning, using \"disclosed in note 2.19\" as required. However, the phrase \"regarding the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a major impact on the financial statements\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is concise but omits the key point about the impact on financial statements. It also uses \"Note 2.19\" with a capital \"N,\" which is appropriate in formal financial documents.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version misplaces the phrase \"their significant impact on the financial statements,\" which changes the meaning slightly. It suggests that the uncertainty itself has an impact, rather than the judgments and estimates.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the source of uncertainty and the impact on financial statements. The use of \"estimation uncertainty\" is appropriate and precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is concise but omits the phrase about the \"main sources of uncertainty,\" which is a critical part of the original sentence.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very close to the original in meaning and structure. However, it uses \"under Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" which may be slightly less precise than \"regarding the adoption of.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly convey that the **main sources of uncertainty** in **management's significant judgments and estimates** related to the **adoption of HKFRSs** and their **impact on financial statements** are **disclosed in Note 2.19**. It should use the exact terms from the dictionary: \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" \"Disclosure,\" and \"financial statements.\"\nThe fourth and sixth translations are the strongest, but the fourth better captures the nuance of the original sentence. It uses \"estimation uncertainty\" and places the impact on financial statements correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nManagement’s judgments and estimates regarding the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards that have a significant impact on the financial statements, as well as the primary sources of estimation uncertainty, are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n\nCertain comparative figures from 2019 have been reclassified to align with the presentation format of the Group's financial statements for this year.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and Non-Controlling Interests\n\nSubsidiaries refer to entities controlled by the Group. The Group is deemed to have control over an entity if it is exposed to risks or has rights related to variable returns from its involvement in the entity's operations, and has the ability to exercise power over the entity to affect those returns. When assessing whether the Group has power, only the substantive rights held by the Group and other parties are considered.\n"}
