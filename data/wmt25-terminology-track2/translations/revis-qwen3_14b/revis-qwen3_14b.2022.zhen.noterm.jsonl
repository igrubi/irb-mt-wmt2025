{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n","en":"2022 was a year of confronting challenges with determination.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus spread rapidly, continuing to pressure global economic growth while inflationary pressures persisted. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further intensified inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies, which increased volatility in global financial markets and heightened the risk of economic slowdown. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic hit Hong Kong, with a rapid rise in infection cases further damaging the economy. Meanwhile, negative media coverage surrounding quarantine measures and restrictions deepened misunderstandings about Hong Kong internationally, threatening its reputation as an international financial center. For the full year, Hong Kong's real gross domestic product contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, advancing a range of development-promoting measures across key strategic areas to further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. After three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations, allowing travelers to once again visit in person and experience the city firsthand. In November last year, the HKMA hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,” which attracted financial leaders from around the world to attend in person. The enthusiastic response from the international community has served as the most compelling evidence of Hong Kong’s full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the resumption of mainland economic activity will inject renewed momentum into Hong Kong and the broader region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to steadfastly fulfill its mandate of maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, while actively seeking more opportunities to support Hong Kong's development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center. We will also continue to contribute to global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will issue a separate 2022 Sustainability Report this year to provide a more detailed overview of the HKMA's initiatives in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial System: As Solid as Ever\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" and its implementation date (1983).\n- They all mention the 2022 demonstration of resilience, the 41 triggers of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee, and the HKMA's purchase of HKD 242.1 billion.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key financial and economic terms are appropriately translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" while others use \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS)\" or \"currency board system.\" The correct acronym is \"LERS,\" and \"LETS\" is incorrect and potentially confusing.\n- **\"Managed float\"** is used in one translation, which is not the correct term for the system described in the original text.\n- **\"Weak-side convertibility undertaking\"** is used in one translation, which is less standard than \"weak-side exchange rate guarantee.\"\n- **\"Currency board system\"** is used in one translation, which is not accurate for the Hong Kong system, as it is not a full currency board but a linked exchange rate system.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the system's resilience was once again demonstrated\" versus \"the resilience of the system was once again demonstrated,\" which is more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the correct and consistent acronym: **LERS** (Linked Exchange Rate System).\n- Avoid incorrect terms like \"LETS\" or \"currency board system.\"\n- Use the standard term **\"weak-side exchange rate guarantee\"** rather than \"weak-side convertibility undertaking.\"\n- Ensure that the translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and stylistically natural in English.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for a financial or economic context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in place since 1983 and has successfully withstood various external shocks across multiple economic cycles. In 2022, the system once again demonstrated its resilience. Amid the significant tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner, in accordance with the established mechanism. Throughout this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to function smoothly, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThis confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from its solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund in its 2022 External Sector Report, the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on multiple factors, including transparent operational rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal systems, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, actively communicating with the public and the market to deepen their understanding of the linked exchange rate system, conducting effective market surveillance, and developing contingency plans for different scenarios all contribute to consolidating confidence in the system across all sectors. Our social media campaign launched to explain the operational mechanisms of the linked exchange rate system has helped effectively maintain market confidence, even during multiple triggers of the weak-side exchange guarantee this year. Internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also made good use of data analytics technology to strengthen market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nThroughout the year, despite macro-level challenges and increasing credit risks, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2022, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.1%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system slightly deteriorated, with the specific classification loan ratio rising to 1.38% by the end of 2022. However, this level remained robust and was still below the long-term average of 1.8% since the year 2000.\nThroughout the year, despite macro-level challenges and increasing credit risks, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity.

However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: the pandemic has lasted three years, challenges have intensified, and Hong Kong's banking system has remained stable due to sound risk management and regulation.\n- The use of terms like \"sound risk management,\" \"effective regulation,\" and \"robust\" or \"resilient\" banking system is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the contrast between the challenges and the banking system's resilience.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive or less idiomatic phrasing, such as \"challenges from various fronts\" or \"challenges from all quarters,\" which, while correct, could be more concise.\n- The phrase \"tightening monetary policies by major central banks\" is slightly awkward in some translations; \"tightening monetary policy\" is more natural when referring to a general trend.\n- The use of \"maintained robustness\" in Translation 6 is somewhat formal and less idiomatic than \"remained robust\" or \"remained resilient.\"\n- Some translations use \"continued to play a vital role\" while others use \"continues to play a vital role.\" The latter is more natural in a present-tense context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more concise and idiomatic expressions, such as \"intensified challenges\" instead of \"challenges from various fronts have intensified.\"\n- Ensure consistency in verb tense and phrasing, particularly in the second half of the sentence.\n- Use \"tightening monetary policy\" rather than \"tightening monetary policies\" when referring to a general trend.\n- Choose between \"resilient\" or \"robust\" based on the intended nuance, but both are acceptable.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe pandemic has lasted for three years, intensifying challenges such as rising geopolitical tensions and the tightening of monetary policy by major central banks. However, thanks to sound risk management and effective regulation over the years, Hong Kong's banking system has remained resilient and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the main regulatory challenges faced over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide the necessary support to their customers while maintaining sound credit risk management, amid ongoing economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" program has been further extended and now includes a voluntary partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers to choose to begin repaying part of the principal, helping customers prepare for a return to normal repayment schedules.\n\nIn response to heightened market volatility caused by major economies significantly tightening their monetary policies, another key regulatory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in 2022 was to strengthen the supervision of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impacts of synchronized monetary policy tightening across major economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios for stress testing to evaluate banks' resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. Regarding operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, we provide guidance to help banks establish comprehensive and holistic operational frameworks to achieve sound operations. We also offer detailed regulatory guidance tailored to specific operational areas, such as providing guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the growing adoption of cloud technology. Additionally, in light of the accelerated development of digitalization, we have strengthened our efforts to combat phishing scams and to advance consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call to provide basic banking services, with some establishing new branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in new development areas. Due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to access their mainland bank accounts. In response, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to help restart approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without needing to travel to the mainland in person.\n\nAnother area of strategic importance for the continued development of the banking industry is enhancing professional capabilities. The demand for professional talent remains substantial as the industry expands. Building on its talent development strategy — \"Connecting Talent with the Future\" — the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several initiatives over the past year to help the banking industry attract, cultivate, and retain talent. These initiatives focus on enhancing and retraining the skills of existing professionals, as well as nurturing the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International Financial Center: Hong Kong Returns to the Global Stage!\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic tone that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately capture the main points: the lifting of pandemic-related travel restrictions in 2022, the efforts to reposition Hong Kong on the international stage, the success of the summit despite the typhoon, and the positive ripple effects.\n- The use of terms like “ripple effect,” “fully recovered,” and “unprecedented vitality” is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as “implemented for a prolonged period” or “after implementing for a prolonged period,” which are less natural in English.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use “executives” or “representatives” interchangeably, which may not always be the most precise term. “Leaders” or “officials” might be more appropriate depending on context.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term “Typhoon Signal No. 8” is correctly used, but the phrasing “first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years” is slightly awkward and could be more naturally phrased as “the first No. 8 typhoon signal in November in 50 years.”\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as “currently holding or planning to hold various events in Hong Kong,” which can be streamlined.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- A more fluent and natural translation should avoid overly literal phrasing and prioritize idiomatic English.\n- The term “international stage” is well-used, but “global stage” might be more natural in this context.\n- The phrase “sending a strong message to the world” is effective, but could be enhanced with more dynamic language, such as “conveying a powerful message to the global community.”\n- The mention of the typhoon should be concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary prepositions or wordiness.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would integrate the strengths of all versions while refining the language for fluency, clarity, and natural expression.\nThe following is the improved translation:\nThe long-standing pandemic-related travel restrictions were gradually lifted in 2022, and we made concerted efforts to bring Hong Kong back onto the global stage. The “International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit” held in November attracted over 200 international and regional leaders from global financial institutions, drawing widespread attention and enthusiastic responses from around the world. Despite the summit coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal in November in 50 years, it was a resounding success, conveying a powerful message that Hong Kong has fully recovered and is now demonstrating unprecedented vitality and energy. We are pleased to see the positive ripple effect of the summit, with many global financial institutions and international organizations currently hosting or planning to host various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message of the original text: the importance of face-to-face communication, the efforts to represent Hong Kong at international conferences, and the goal of deepening understanding of Hong Kong's financial system and opportunities under \"one country, two systems.\"\nStrengths include accurate translation of key terms such as \"face-to-face communication,\" \"global financial institutions,\" and \"one country, two systems.\" The use of \"sound financial system\" and \"robust financial system\" is appropriate and consistent with the original's tone. Most translations also maintain a formal and professional tone, suitable for the context of a policy or official statement.\nHowever, there are notable differences in fluency and precision. For instance, the first translation uses \"communication and interaction,\" which is slightly redundant. The second and third translations use \"realized the importance\" and \"leverage overseas visits,\" which are more concise and natural. The fourth translation uses \"I have personally represented Hong Kong as much as possible,\" which is slightly less formal than \"we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong.\" The fifth translation uses \"strive to represent\" and \"management teams,\" which are slightly less precise than \"made every effort to personally represent\" and \"senior management.\" The sixth translation has a minor error with \"HKMAO\" instead of \"HKMA.\"\nImprovements could focus on consistency in pronoun usage (e.g., using \"we\" rather than alternating between \"I\" and \"we\"), more precise verb choices (e.g., \"made every effort\" over \"strive\"), and ensuring that the structure of the sentence flows smoothly without redundancy.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain a formal tone, use consistent pronouns, and ensure clarity and fluency in conveying the original message.\nHong Kong's Monetary Authority and I have come to appreciate the importance of face-to-face communication and engagement. In addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and use overseas visits as opportunities to meet with senior management of global financial institutions. These efforts aim to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the various opportunities it offers under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we continue to expand market frontiers in strategic priority areas such as financial technology, opportunities presented by the Mainland, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong’s financial platform, providing top-tier services to attract more businesses to establish themselves here. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the “2022 Sustainability Report.”\n\n# Financial Technology\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\nAll six translations are very close to each other and convey the core meaning of the original text accurately. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations use \"made significant progress,\" which is a standard and natural expression. The second and fourth use \"achieved significant progress,\" which is also correct but slightly more formal. The sixth translation uses \"have made,\" which implies an ongoing action, but the original text refers to completed progress in 2022, so \"made\" is more appropriate.\nThe use of \"across all five areas\" (first, fifth) is slightly more natural than \"in all five areas\" (second, third, fourth, sixth), as it emphasizes the breadth of progress. The term \"key areas\" (second, fourth, sixth) adds emphasis that may or may not be present in the original, depending on context.\nConsidering these nuances, the best translation would use \"made significant progress across all five areas in 2022\" to reflect the breadth of progress and the completed nature of the action. The verb \"made\" is more natural in this context than \"achieved,\" and the phrase \"across all five areas\" is more idiomatic than \"in all five areas\" or \"in all five key areas.\"\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\n\nWe have achieved ideal results in our efforts to comprehensively promote the digitalization of banking. According to the assessment of fintech applications, the Hong Kong banking industry has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, and the range of technologies being utilized continues to expand. Since 2017, our gradual promotion and support of digitalization efforts have received active responses from banks and continue to yield results, with encouraging outcomes. We will continue to closely collaborate with the industry to further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and to foster the development of individual technology categories, based on the assessment results.\n\nThis year, we have made significant progress in our work on central bank digital currencies. The \"mBridge\" project, a multilateral central bank digital currency cross-border network, has entered the pilot phase and has become one of the first global CBDC initiatives to enable real settlement for cross-border corporate transactions. At the retail level, technical testing for cross-border use of digital RMB has entered its second phase, primarily focusing on topping up digital RMB wallets through the Faster Payment System. Regarding digital Hong Kong dollars, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the potential future issuance of digital Hong Kong dollars and launch the second-track pilot program, inviting industry stakeholders to explore feasible application scenarios for digital Hong Kong dollars in depth.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of financial technology. Our “Commercial Data Interchange,” launched in October last year, represents a significant step forward in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a shared data infrastructure based on data owner authorization, the “Commercial Data Interchange” enables financial institutions to access business data from companies, making it easier for businesses—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises—to obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, the “Commercial Data Interchange” had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, totaling more than HKD 1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the necessity to monitor and properly address the risks that may arise from such developments. We are closely monitoring the development of the virtual assets sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the opinions gathered from public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and define their regulatory scope. In the future, the stablecoins we will regulate first will be those that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as these types of stablecoins may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that, under appropriate regulations, the industry will be able to more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector are actively preparing to embrace this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will fully unlock the potential of financial technology and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n# Opportunities in Mainland China\n"}

The labor market initially deteriorated but gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. With the full resumption of cross-border travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the stability and health of Hong Kong's banking system in 2022. It uses precise financial terminology, and the translation must reflect this formality and accuracy.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Resilient\" is a strong and appropriate term for describing the banking system. \"Remaining ample\" and \"at a healthy level\" are natural and precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Sound\" is a slightly more formal synonym for \"resilient\" and is also appropriate. The use of \"healthy levels\" is slightly less precise than \"healthy level\" in this context, but it is still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The structure is slightly awkward with \"the quality of assets continued to be at a healthy level.\" The use of \"continued to be\" is redundant and disrupts the parallel structure of the sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Sector\" is a slightly less precise term than \"system\" in this context. \"Sound\" is a good synonym for \"healthy,\" but the sentence is slightly less formal than the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Robust\" is a strong and appropriate synonym for \"resilient.\" \"Conditions\" is slightly less precise than \"positions\" in financial contexts. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Robust\" is a good choice. \"Continued to maintain a healthy asset quality\" is slightly wordy and less direct than the original.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise financial terminology, and ensure parallel structure and fluency. \"Resilient\" or \"robust\" are both strong terms, but \"resilient\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. \"Capital and liquidity positions\" is the most precise phrasing. \"At a healthy level\" is more natural than \"at healthy levels\" or \"sound.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2022, with capital and liquidity positions remaining ample and asset quality continuing to be at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAs the United States tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, triggering the weak-side exchange guarantee multiple times during the year. However, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly and smooth manner, repeatedly demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nThe original text discusses the volatile investment environment in 2022, the decline in multiple asset classes, and the relatively moderate loss of the foreign exchange fund compared to other diversified funds. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness.\nTranslation 1 is concise and clear but uses \"Exchange Fund\" without specifying, which may be ambiguous. It also uses \"a loss that was relatively moderate\" which is slightly awkward.\nTranslation 2 improves by specifying \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and using \"negative 4.5%\" which is more natural in financial contexts. However, \"declining simultaneously\" is slightly redundant.\nTranslation 3 is very close to the ideal, using \"foreign exchange fund\" in lowercase (which is acceptable if it's not a proper noun), and \"represented a relatively moderate loss\" is fluent and natural.\nTranslation 4 uses \"falling simultaneously\" and \"loss magnitude being relatively mild\" which is slightly less natural than other phrasings.\nTranslation 5 uses \"resulted in relatively mild losses\" which is slightly off in meaning, as the fund itself did not \"result in\" the losses, but rather experienced them.\nTranslation 6 uses \"various asset classes\" and \"multi-asset funds\" which are appropriate, and \"a relatively mild loss\" is natural. However, \"foreign exchange fund\" is in lowercase, which may be less formal than needed.\nImprovements could include using \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" with a capital \"F\" if it's a proper noun, using \"negative 4.5%\" instead of \"-4.5%\", and ensuring that the comparison is clear and natural.\nThe best possible translation would be a version that is fluent, accurate, and uses appropriate financial terminology.\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. The Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of negative 4.5%, a relatively mild loss compared to the performance of most diversified asset funds in the market.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in promoting responsible investment and asset diversification, along with the performance of the long-term growth portfolio since 2009. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the core message: the HKMA's commitment to responsible investment and the performance of the long-term growth portfolio.\n- The term \"annualized internal rate of return\" is consistently used, which is the correct financial terminology.\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is appropriate in formal or financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" fully, which is correct but less concise than \"HKMA.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"strive for promoting,\" which is grammatically awkward; \"strive to promote\" is more natural.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Long-Term Growth Fund\" instead of \"portfolio,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original term.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"has continued to strive to promote,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"is also continuing to promote,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise than \"continues to promote.\"\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a significant error. It also uses \"responsible investing\" instead of \"responsible investment,\" which is slightly less formal and may not match the tone of the original.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for brevity and clarity.\n- Use \"continues to promote\" for conciseness and natural flow.\n- Ensure the term \"portfolio\" is used correctly, not \"fund\" unless specified.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing such as \"strive for promoting\" and use \"strive to promote\" instead.\n- Ensure the correct name of the authority is used: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be concise, accurate, and use the correct terminology and structure.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\n# Banking System Stability\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking System Stability\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, but they all essentially convey the same meaning. However, there are notable differences in formatting and capitalization.\nThe first junior translator's translation, \"Banking system stable,\" is grammatically incorrect as it uses an adjective (\"stable\") instead of a noun (\"stability\") to describe the banking system. This makes the phrase a fragment rather than a complete noun phrase.\nThe second and fourth junior translators both use \"Banking system stability,\" which is grammatically correct but lacks the proper capitalization for a title. In English, titles typically have major words capitalized, especially when used in headings or as standalone phrases.\nThe third and sixth junior translators use \"Banking System Stability,\" which is the most appropriate in terms of capitalization for a title or heading. However, the use of the hashtag \"#\" in the original Chinese text is not typically used in English titles, so it may be better to omit it unless the context specifically requires it.\nThe fifth junior translator includes the hashtag in their translation, resulting in \"# Banking System Stability,\" which is the closest to the original format but may not be standard in English usage.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Banking System Stability,\" which is grammatically correct, appropriately capitalized, and omits the hashtag unless it is necessary for the context. This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text while adhering to English grammar and formatting conventions.\n\nIn response to expanding volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management, and is working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in order to address the growing threat of cyberattacks and the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and institutional names. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: \n   - The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations correctly use \"HKMA\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), which is the official name of the institution. The fourth translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the institution in question.\n   - The term \"property transfer payment arrangements\" in the first translation is slightly ambiguous. The original Chinese likely refers to \"property mortgage refinancing\" or \"mortgage payment arrangements,\" which is more accurately captured in the third and fifth translations.\n   - The term \"Credit Information Platform\" is correctly used in most translations, but the sixth translation uses \"credit data platform\" and \"credit reference agencies,\" which are less precise and may not align with the official terminology used by the HKMA.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - All translations are grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. The second and fifth translations are particularly smooth in their phrasing and sentence structure.\n   - The sixth translation uses \"will also be operational within the year,\" which is slightly less precise than \"was also launched this year\" or \"was also activated during the year.\"\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**:\n   - The use of \"HKMA\" is essential for clarity and institutional accuracy. The fourth translation's use of \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" is incorrect and should be avoided.\n   - The term \"regulatory regime\" is appropriate in the context of financial regulation, as used in the first, second, and fifth translations.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct institutional name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Accurately reflect the financial terminology used in the original text, such as \"property mortgage payment arrangements\" or \"mortgage refinancing.\"\n- Use precise terms like \"Credit Information Platform\" and \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model.\n- Maintain a fluent and natural English structure without unnecessary redundancy or ambiguity.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, ensuring clarity, precision, and institutional correctness.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further introduced consumer protection measures concerning \"buy now, pay later\" products and new property mortgage payment arrangements. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a virtual asset regulatory framework, issued guidelines on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new trust business regulatory regime. The \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model was also launched this year.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to enhance the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) ecosystem, strengthen responses to fraud, and promote the use of data and technology through initiatives like the \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" series, while accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in AML work.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terminology such as \"AML\/CTF ecosystem\" and \"RegTech Lab.\" However, it uses \"fraud\" instead of \"scams,\" which may be less precise in the context of financial crime. Also, the phrase \"AML Regulatory Technology (RegTech) Lab\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is concise and clear, using \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" and \"fraud cases.\" However, it omits \"counter-terrorist financing (CTF)\" from the original, which is an important detail. It also uses \"RegTech\" without defining it, which may be less accessible to a general audience.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is grammatically sound but lacks the full term \"counter-terrorist financing (CTF)\" and uses \"AML operations\" instead of \"AML work,\" which is slightly less precise. The structure is also more fragmented, with a period separating the two main clauses.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very similar to the second, with the addition of \"scams\" instead of \"fraud cases.\" It also includes \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" and \"RegTech,\" but again omits \"CTF\" and uses \"fraud\" instead of \"scams.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"scams\" and \"AML work.\" It also includes \"AML Compliance Technology Lab\" and \"RegTech.\" However, the structure is slightly awkward with the placement of \"as well as.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is well-structured and includes \"AML\/CTF ecosystem\" and \"RegTech.\" It also uses \"scams\" and \"AML work.\" However, \"Regtech\" is used without the hyphen, and \"AML Regtech Lab\" is less precise than \"AML Compliance Tech Lab.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include the full term \"anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF)\" as in the original, use \"scams\" to reflect the specific context of financial fraud, and include \"RegTech\" with a hyphen for consistency. It should also maintain a smooth and professional tone, avoiding redundancy and ensuring clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) ecosystem, strengthen responses to scams, and further promote the application of data and technology through its \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" series, while accelerating the HKMA’s adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in its AML work.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, precision, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and accurately translate the key terms such as \"capital adequacy\" and \"disclosure standards.\"\n- The phrase \"sustainable talent pool\" and \"enhance employees' skills\" are consistently used, which is appropriate in the context of workforce development.\n- The use of \"working with the banking sector\/industry\" is consistent and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"The Monetary Authority\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is less precise and may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"The Authority has also worked together with the banking industry\" – the use of \"worked together\" is slightly redundant and less formal than \"is working with.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"collaborated with the banking sector\" – while correct, \"collaborated\" is more formal and may not match the tone of the original text.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"The HKMA is also working together with the banking industry\" – the phrase \"working together\" is redundant and can be simplified.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"enhance the skills of professionals\" – \"professionals\" is a bit vague and less specific than \"employees\" or \"workforce.\"\n- **Translation 6** is the most precise, using \"HKMA\" and \"workforce\" – both are appropriate and concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" on first mention, followed by the acronym.\n- Use \"working with\" instead of \"worked together with\" or \"collaborated with\" for a more natural and current tone.\n- Use \"workforce\" or \"employees\" instead of \"professionals\" for clarity and specificity.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is concise and flows naturally in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards, locally. The HKMA is also working with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance the skills of its workforce for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources at all locally systemically important banks, marking an important milestone in the development of the resolution framework.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe original Chinese text is a straightforward title: \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\". The junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately, but there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe first, fourth, fifth, and sixth translations use the exact same title: \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\". These are consistent and grammatically correct. However, the use of \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" is slightly inconsistent with standard English title case conventions, which typically capitalize only the first letter of the title and proper nouns. \nThe second translation uses \"Centre\" with a \"C\", which is the British English spelling. While this is not incorrect, it may be less common in American English contexts, which typically use \"Center\". The third translation uses lowercase for \"status\" and \"center\", which is more in line with standard title case but lacks the emphasis that capitalization can provide in a title.\nIn terms of fluency and cultural appropriateness, all translations are acceptable. However, for a title that is likely to be used in an international or formal context, it is preferable to use \"Center\" with a \"C\" as it is more widely recognized in global financial discourse. Additionally, the use of title case with only the first letter of the title capitalized is more standard in English publishing.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be: \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\" This version uses lowercase for \"status\" and \"center\" in line with standard title case, and uses the more commonly accepted American English spelling \"center\".\n\nThe original sentence in Traditional Chinese is concise and formal, emphasizing the success of the summit and its positive impact on Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, as well as the broader \"ripple effect\" it has created.\n**Review of the translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and fluent. However, \"the successful holding of\" is slightly wordy and less natural than alternatives like \"was a success\" or \"achieved success.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate. The use of \"achieved success\" is natural and maintains the original tone. However, \"consolidating\" is slightly less common than \"reinforcing\" or \"solidifying\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is clear and natural. \"Creating a positive ripple effect\" is slightly more direct than \"generating,\" but both are acceptable. The use of \"position\" instead of \"status\" is a minor variation with no significant impact on meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. The use of \"Leaders’\" with an apostrophe is more appropriate than \"Leaders Investment\" without it. \"Creating positive ripple effects\" is slightly more natural than \"generating,\" and \"position\" is a good choice.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is excellent. \"Solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub\" is more dynamic and natural than \"consolidating\" or \"reinforcing.\" \"Generating positive ripple effects\" is also well-chosen. The use of \"global financial hub\" is slightly more modern and impactful than \"international financial center.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is also a strong translation. \"Reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international financial center\" is accurate and natural. However, \"reinforcing\" is slightly less strong than \"solidifying\" or \"consolidating\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should use strong, active verbs and appropriate vocabulary that reflects the significance of the summit and its impact. \"Solidifying\" is a stronger and more dynamic verb than \"consolidating\" or \"reinforcing.\" \"Global financial hub\" is more modern and impactful than \"international financial center.\" \"Creating positive ripple effects\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"generating.\"\n**Improved translation:**\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was a success, solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub and creating positive ripple effects.\n\nThe original text discusses the optimization of a currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as the development of financial mechanisms to support Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB hub. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\nTranslation 1 is fluent and accurate, using appropriate financial terminology such as \"monetary swap agreement\" and \"dual-trading platform dealer mechanism.\" However, it uses \"optimized during the year,\" which is slightly less precise than \"optimized within the year\" or \"optimized this year.\"\nTranslation 2 is also accurate but introduces \"Central Money Markets Unit (CMU),\" which is not mentioned in the original text. This is a misinterpretation of \"Debt Instrument Central Settlement System.\"\nTranslation 3 incorrectly refers to \"Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS)\" instead of \"Swap Connect,\" which is a significant error. It also misrepresents the system being developed as the \"central clearing system for debt instruments\" rather than the \"Debt Instrument Central Settlement System.\"\nTranslation 4 is very close to the original in terms of structure and terminology. It uses \"dual-trading-platform market maker mechanism,\" which is slightly wordy but accurate. It also correctly identifies the system as the \"Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments.\"\nTranslation 5 uses \"Currency Swap Connect\" instead of \"Swap Connect,\" which is not the official name. It also uses \"dual-counterparty mechanism,\" which is not the same as the \"dual-cabinet market maker mechanism\" mentioned in the original.\nTranslation 6 contains a mix of correct and incorrect terms. It uses \"dual柜台 market maker mechanism,\" which is a mix of English and Chinese characters, and incorrectly refers to the system as the \"Central Movable Securities Settlement System.\"\nBased on this review, the best translation should use accurate terminology, maintain the original structure, and ensure fluency and clarity. It should correctly identify \"Swap Connect\" as the name of the initiative, use the correct name for the system being developed, and avoid introducing terms not present in the original text.\nThe improved translation should reflect the optimization of the currency swap agreement, the preparation for \"Swap Connect,\" the introduction of a dual-cabinet market maker mechanism, and the development of the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\nThe best possible translation is as follows:\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was optimized within the year, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also collaborated with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of \"Swap Connect\" and to introduce a dual-cabinet market maker mechanism to support the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, efforts are being made to develop the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\n在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。\n**Review of Translations:**\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all quite close in meaning and structure, but there are subtle differences in word choice, tone, and fluency that affect the overall quality.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"significant progress\" and \"financial platform,\" which are accurate but slightly formal. The structure is fluent and grammatically correct.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"good progress\" instead of \"significant,\" which is more modest and aligns with the original's \"良好進展.\" However, it lacks the emphasis on the magnitude of the progress.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"strengthening the competitiveness\" instead of \"enhancing,\" which is a minor variation but still accurate. The use of \"and\" instead of \"as well as\" at the end is slightly less fluid.\n- **Translation 4** starts with \"Made good progress,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context. It should be \"Good progress has been made\" or \"Significant progress has been made.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"financial hub\" instead of \"financial platform,\" which is a more common term in financial contexts and may be more appropriate. It also uses \"centres\" with an's' instead of 'centers,' which is acceptable in British English but may be inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n- **Translation 6** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"and\" instead of \"as well as\" at the end, which is slightly less fluid.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, fluency, and natural English expression. \"Good progress has been made\" is more aligned with the original's \"良好進展\" than \"significant progress,\" which may overstate the achievement. \"Financial hub\" is a more natural and commonly used term in financial contexts than \"financial platform.\" Additionally, the use of \"as well as\" at the end of the list is more fluid than \"and\" or \"among other areas.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nGood progress has been made in strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a financial hub, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing implementation of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, its goal of promoting financial technology (FinTech) adoption in the financial sector, and enhancing Hong Kong's status as a FinTech hub. It also mentions the steady growth in usage of the fast payment system \"轉數快\" (FPS) due to enhanced functionality.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"FinTech\" consistently and correctly identifies \"FPS\" as the fast payment system. However, it omits the Chinese name \"轉數快\" in parentheses, which may be important for clarity or context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"functions\" instead of \"functionality,\" which is slightly less precise but still acceptable. It also omits the Chinese name of the system.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate but has a critical issue: it uses the literal transliteration \"Zhu Shu Kuai\" instead of the official English name \"FPS.\" This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the system. It also uses \"fintech\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It includes the official English name \"FPS\" and the Chinese name in parentheses, which is helpful for clarity. It uses \"enhanced features\" instead of \"enhanced functionality,\" which is slightly less precise but still acceptable. The use of \"status\" instead of \"position\" is also a minor stylistic choice.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but overly verbose. It uses \"Faster Payment System\" in full and then abbreviates it to \"FPS,\" which is redundant. It also uses \"functionalities\" instead of \"functionality,\" which is less natural in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate but has some redundancy. It uses \"Faster Payments\" as an alternative name for FPS, which is unnecessary. It also uses \"enhancement of its functionalities\" instead of \"enhanced functionality,\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and include both the official English name and the Chinese name of the fast payment system. It should use \"FinTech\" consistently and avoid unnecessary redundancy. The phrase \"enhanced functionality\" is more natural than \"enhanced features\" or \"enhancement of its functionalities.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy to promote the adoption of financial technology within the financial sector and enhance Hong Kong's position as a FinTech hub. The fast payment system \"FPS\" (轉數快) has seen steady growth in usage with enhanced functionality.\n\n# Organizational Functions\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, with the goal of enhancing public understanding of its policies and work. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the core message: the HKMA communicates with society and the market to improve public understanding of its policies.\n- The use of \"various channels\" and \"effective communication\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- Most translations use \"enhance\" or \"enhancing\" to reflect the purpose of the communication, which is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"society\" while others use \"public\" or \"community.\" While all are acceptable, \"public\" is more commonly used in official contexts when referring to the general populace.\n- **Institutional Name:** Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. The full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is more precise and avoids confusion with other monetary authorities.\n- **\"Work\" vs. \"Operations\":** The original uses \"工作\" (work), which can be translated as \"work\" or \"operations.\" \"Operations\" is more formal and commonly used in official contexts, making it a better fit.\n- **Verb Tense and Structure:** Some translations use \"thereby enhancing\" or \"enhancing,\" while others use \"to enhance.\" The latter is more direct and aligns better with the original sentence structure.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity.\n- Use \"public\" instead of \"society\" or \"community\" for consistency with official communication.\n- Use \"operations\" instead of \"work\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"to enhance\" for a direct and clear structure.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains effective communication with the public and the market through various channels to enhance understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has meticulously established a work team emphasizing adaptability and sustainable development, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, it uses \"through a tender process under its 'Institutional Bond Issuance Program'\" which is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also accurate but places \"for the first time\" after the subject, which is slightly awkward. The phrase \"bidding process\" is less formal than \"tender process\" and may not be the preferred term in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"launched its first tender\" effectively. The phrase \"with a tenor of 20 years\" is more precise than \"20-year\" in some contexts, though both are acceptable. The use of \"amounting to HK$500 million\" is slightly more formal and flows well.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is concise but uses \"worth HKD 500 million\" which is less standard than \"amounting to HK$500 million\" or \"of HK$500 million.\" Also, \"a 20-year Hong Kong dollar government bond\" is slightly ambiguous—does it refer to one bond or a series?\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is very similar to the first and is grammatically sound. However, \"made its first issuance\" is slightly more formal than necessary and could be simplified.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but places \"first issued\" after the program name, which is slightly awkward. Also, \"500 million Hong Kong dollars\" is less standard than \"HK$500 million.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard financial terminology. It should clearly indicate that this is the first issuance under the program, the amount, the currency, the term, and the method of issuance. The phrase \"through a tender process\" is more formal and appropriate than \"bidding process.\" Also, \"HK$500 million\" is the standard format for expressing currency in this context.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe government issued HK$500 million in 20-year Hong Kong dollar government bonds through a tender process under its \"Institutional Bond Issuance Program\" for the first time.\n\n# July 4th\nThe original text is a simple date: # 7月4日. The junior translators have all provided translations that are grammatically correct and fluent in English. However, there are a few nuances to consider.\nFirst, the use of the hashtag (#) in the original text is notable. In English, hashtags are commonly used in social media contexts to categorize content or indicate topics. However, in formal or standard writing, the hashtag is typically omitted unless it serves a specific purpose. In this case, since the original text only includes the date with a hashtag, it is unclear whether the hashtag is meant to be included in the translation.\nSecond, the format of the date in English is typically written as \"July 4th\" rather than \"July 4\" or \"July 4th\" with a hashtag. The junior translators have all used \"July 4th\" correctly, but the inclusion of the hashtag in some translations may be unnecessary unless it is part of a larger context or platform-specific requirement.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be to omit the hashtag unless it is explicitly required for the context in which the translation will be used. Therefore, the most appropriate and natural translation of the original text is \"July 4th.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that warrant a critical review.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the involved parties: the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), with most using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity.\n- The key actions—optimization\/enhancement of the currency swap agreement, conversion to a standing agreement, and the expansion of the agreement's scale—are all accurately captured.\n- The numerical figures are consistently translated, though there is a minor inconsistency in the use of \"RMB\" versus \"yuan\" and \"HKD\" versus \"Hong Kong dollars.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The use of \"optimization\" versus \"enhancement\" is a matter of style, but \"optimization\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. However, \"enhancement\" is also acceptable.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** The first and sixth translations use \"the agreement's scale has been expanded\" and \"with the agreement's scale expanded,\" respectively. The latter is more concise and natural in English.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"standing agreement\" is appropriate, but \"standing arrangement\" is more commonly used in financial and policy contexts, as seen in the fourth and fifth translations.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations include unnecessary words such as \"also\" in \"has also been expanded,\" which can be omitted for brevity and clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"standing arrangement\" instead of \"standing agreement\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" consistently with numerical values, as this is standard in financial reporting.\n- Avoid redundancy by omitting unnecessary words like \"also.\"\n- Ensure clarity and conciseness in sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the optimization of their currency swap agreement, converting it into a standing arrangement that no longer requires renewal. The agreement's scale has been expanded from RMB 500 billion\/HKD 590 billion to RMB 800 billion\/HKD 940 billion.\n\n# July 13th\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting. The first, third, fourth, and sixth translators used \"July 13th,\" which is the standard English format for dates. The second and sixth translators included the hashtag, which matches the original text. The fifth translator used \"July 13\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less formal and less commonly used in written English.\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be to retain the hashtag and use the standard date format with the ordinal suffix. Therefore, the best translation is \"# July 13th.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an updated commitment statement reaffirming its commitment to adhere to the updated version of the Global Foreign Exchange Market Guidelines when acting as a market participant in the foreign exchange market.\n\n# July 22nd\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headlines or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting that could be refined for consistency and natural English usage.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations all use \"July 22nd,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English. However, the use of the ordinal suffix \"nd\" is optional in many contexts, especially in titles or headings, where brevity is preferred. The third and sixth translations use \"July 22\" without the ordinal suffix, which is also acceptable and more concise.\nThe third translation also includes a \"#\" symbol, which may be intended to mirror the original Chinese formatting (which uses a hashtag or number sign). However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date formats unless it is part of a specific system or platform (e.g., social media posts or coding contexts). Therefore, including it may be unnecessary or misleading in a general context.\nConsidering these observations, the best approach is to use the concise and standard format \"July 22\" without the ordinal suffix or the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and widely accepted format for dates in English, especially in titles or headings. This format avoids unnecessary characters while maintaining clarity and correctness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced enhancements to its RMB liquidity arrangements, including an expanded scale and streamlined procedures.\n\n# Banking System\n\n# January 28\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. The junior translators have mostly captured this accurately, though there are minor differences in formatting. The first, third, and fourth translations use \"January 28\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is acceptable in many contexts, especially when the date is used in a list or as a heading. The second, fifth, and sixth translations include \"28th,\" which is more formal and commonly used in written English when referring to specific dates in full sentences or formal documents.\nHowever, since the original text only includes the number \"1月28日\" with a hashtag, the most appropriate translation would be to mirror this simplicity. Including the \"th\" suffix may add unnecessary formality or specificity that is not present in the original. Additionally, the use of a hashtag (#) in the original suggests it may be part of a list, title, or social media post, where brevity is preferred.\nTherefore, the best translation would be \"January 28\" without the \"th\" suffix and with the hashtag, as it most closely reflects the original in both form and function.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of regulatory announcements. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in accuracy, fluency, and terminology that require attention.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"circular\" appropriately and correctly identifying the SFC. However, it omits the acronym \"HKMA\" for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is commonly used in official contexts.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate and fluent, correctly using \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" with their acronyms. The use of \"engaged in\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"engaging in,\" which is a minor but notable difference in tone.\n**Translation 3** is mostly correct but uses \"to provide updated guidance on intermediaries engaging in...\" which slightly changes the structure and may be less direct than the original. The phrase \"on intermediaries\" could be misinterpreted as guidance about intermediaries rather than for them.\n**Translation 4** contains a critical error: it refers to the \"Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO)\" instead of the \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\" This is a significant mistake, as the SFO is a legal statute, not a regulatory body. Additionally, it uses \"customers\" instead of \"clients,\" which, while not incorrect, is less precise in a regulatory context.\n**Translation 5** repeats the error from Translation 4 by incorrectly identifying the SFO as the SFC. It also uses \"customers\" instead of \"clients,\" which is less standard in regulatory language.\n**Translation 6** is accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" correctly, and employing \"clients\" as in the original. The structure is clear and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct acronyms for both regulatory bodies (HKMA and SFC), maintain the formal tone of the original, and use \"clients\" rather than \"customers\" to align with regulatory terminology. The phrase \"providing updated guidance to intermediaries on activities related to virtual assets\" is slightly more precise than \"engaging in virtual asset-related activities,\" as it emphasizes the subject of the guidance rather than the action of the intermediaries.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) have jointly issued a circular providing updated guidance to intermediaries on activities related to virtual assets to protect clients.\n\n# January 28\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. The junior translators have mostly captured this accurately, though there are minor differences in formatting. The first, third, and fourth translations use \"January 28\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is acceptable in many contexts, especially when the date is used in a list or as a heading. The second, fifth, and sixth translations include \"28th,\" which is more formal and commonly used in written English when referring to specific dates in full sentences or formal documents.\nHowever, since the original text only includes the number \"1月28日\" with a hashtag, the most appropriate translation would be to mirror this simplicity. Including the \"th\" suffix may add unnecessary formality or specificity that is not present in the original. Additionally, the use of a hashtag (#) in the original suggests it may be part of a list, title, or social media post, where brevity is preferred.\nTherefore, the best translation would be \"January 28\" without the \"th\" suffix and with the hashtag, as it most closely reflects the original in both form and function.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has updated its regulatory guidance on money laundering and terrorist financing risks related to bank management, virtual assets, and virtual asset service providers.\n\n# February 8th\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese to denote a specific day. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning of the date, but there are subtle differences in formatting and style that can be refined for clarity and consistency with English conventions.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations all use \"February 8th,\" which is the standard way to write the date in English. However, the second and fourth translations include a hashtag (#), which may be appropriate in certain contexts (e.g., social media posts or headings), but it is unnecessary in a simple date listing. The third and sixth translations use \"February 8\" without the ordinal suffix \"th,\" which is less common in formal English writing, though it is not incorrect in informal contexts.\nThe best translation should be concise, clear, and follow standard English conventions for writing dates. Using \"February 8th\" without any additional symbols like the hashtag is the most natural and widely accepted format. It is also important to maintain consistency with how dates are typically presented in English, which usually includes the ordinal indicator (\"th\") for days of the month.\n\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**金管局宣布延長「銀行業人才起動計劃」6個月。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA announced the extension of the 'Banking Industry Talent Activation Program' by six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"HKMA\" and \"extension by six months.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Talent Activation Program\" is a direct translation of \"人才起動計劃\" and may not be the official English name. Also, \"by six months\" is slightly awkward compared to \"for six months.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Services and Markets Commission has announced an extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Launch Program' by six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Banking Sector Talent Launch Program\" as a possible alternative.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly identifies the organization as the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the correct \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced an extension of the 'Banking Industry Talent Start-up Scheme' for six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organization and uses \"for six months.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Start-up Scheme\" is not an accurate translation of \"起動計劃.\" \"Start-up\" implies entrepreneurship, which is not the intended meaning here.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced a six-month extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Development Scheme.'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organization and uses \"six-month extension,\" which is fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Talent Development Scheme\" is not the exact translation of \"人才起動計劃.\" \"Development\" implies ongoing growth, whereas \"activation\" or \"launch\" may be more appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Authority announced the extension of the 'Banking Industry Talent Activation Program' by six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Talent Activation Program\" and \"by six months.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the organization as \"The Financial Authority,\" which is not the official name of the HKMA.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA announced the extension of the 'Banking Industry Talent Launch Program' by six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"by six months.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Talent Launch Program\" is not the most accurate translation of \"人才起動計劃.\" \"Launch\" may imply a new initiative, not an ongoing program.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe most accurate translation should:\n- Use the correct official name of the organization: **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**.\n- Use the correct English name of the program, which is likely **\"Banking Industry Talent Activation Program\"** or **\"Banking Sector Talent Activation Program\"** (based on official HKMA terminology).\n- Use the phrase **\"for six months\"** for fluency and natural English.\n- Avoid incorrect or misleading terms like \"Financial Authority\" or \"Start-up Scheme.\"\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced a six-month extension of the \"Banking Industry Talent Activation Program.\"\n\n# February 23\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company), announced that the mortgage insurance plan has been revised and expanded in scope for completed residential properties.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text states that Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (the parent company) fully owns Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (the subsidiary), and the subsidiary has revised and expanded the mortgage insurance plan for completed residential properties.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, correctly identifying the parent-subsidiary relationship and the nature of the announcement. However, it uses \"Mortgage Securities Company\" as a parenthetical for \"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited,\" which is slightly redundant since the full name is already provided.\n**Translation 2** misidentifies the parent and subsidiary relationship, stating that Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited is the parent of Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Company Limited, which contradicts the original text.\n**Translation 3** reverses the parent-subsidiary relationship, stating that the Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Corporation is fully owned by the Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Company, which is incorrect.\n**Translation 4** is grammatically awkward and structurally confusing, with the subject and verb order disrupted by the parenthetical information.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and clear, correctly identifying the parent-subsidiary relationship and the nature of the announcement. It uses \"amended and expanded in its scope of application,\" which is slightly more formal than the original but still appropriate.\n**Translation 6** introduces a new entity, \"Hong Kong Mortgage Guarantee Corporation Limited,\" which is not mentioned in the original text, making it inaccurate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company), announced that the mortgage insurance plan has been revised and expanded in scope for completed residential properties.\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company), announced that the mortgage insurance plan has been revised and expanded in scope for completed residential properties.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding an optimized loan program. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of terminology, grammar, and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the program as a \"100% Guaranteed Personal Loan Scheme\" or similar, which is accurate.\n- The dates (April 19 and the end of April 2023) are consistently translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The term \"特惠貸款\" is translated as \"Concessionary,\" \"Preferential,\" \"Privilege,\" or \"Privilege Loan Program.\" While all are acceptable, \"Preferential\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and is more natural in English.\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use \"has introduced\" and \"has been extended\" in a way that may be slightly awkward. For example, \"has introduced optimized measures (effective April 19)\" is grammatically correct but could be more fluid.\n- **Date Format:** Some translations use \"April 19th\" while others use \"April 19.\" In formal writing, \"April 19\" is more standard unless the context requires the ordinal form.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations use \"has introduced... and extended,\" which is acceptable, but could be more concise or varied in structure.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Preferential\" instead of \"Concessionary\" or \"Privilege\" for \"特惠貸款\" to align with common financial terminology.\n- Use \"effective April 19\" without the ordinal form for consistency and formality.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is smooth and avoids redundancy, for example, using \"with the application period extended\" instead of \"and extended the application period.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe \"100% Guaranteed Personal Preferential Loan Program\" has introduced optimized measures (effective April 19) with the application period extended to the end of April 2023.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe original text discusses a policy extension by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in collaboration with a specific loan coordination mechanism for SMEs in the banking sector. The key elements include the extension of a repayment scheme, the duration of the extension, the specifics of the trade financing loan extension, and the introduction of a partial repayment option.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, but uses \"pre-approval\" instead of \"pre-approved,\" which is slightly less idiomatic. Also, \"allowing an additional 90-day extension\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the original in terms of structure and meaning. It uses \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan\" and \"trade financing loans\" correctly. However, \"will also be extended by 90 days\" is slightly more natural than \"allowing an additional 90-day extension.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation uses \"Principal Payment Holiday\" instead of \"Interest-Only Repayment,\" which may mislead readers. It also uses \"repayments\" instead of \"repayment\" in the last sentence, which is slightly inconsistent.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and natural, using \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Loan Scheme\" and \"October 31\" instead of \"end of October,\" which is more precise. However, \"allowing the principal repayment period... to be extended by 90 days\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"Principal and Interest Payment Only,\" which is not accurate. The phrase \"return to normal repayment schedules\" is slightly less natural than \"resume normal repayment.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and natural, using \"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Loan Coordination Mechanism\" and \"pre-approved Interest-only Repayment.\" However, \"can be extended by 90 days\" is slightly less precise than \"will be extended by 90 days.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, natural, and consistent with the original meaning. It should use the correct name for the authority (HKMA), the correct name for the mechanism, and the correct terminology for the loan scheme. It should also use precise and natural phrasing, avoiding redundancy and awkward constructions.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in conjunction with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" has announced the extension of the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme for an additional six months until the end of October. The principal repayment period for trade financing loans will also be extended by 90 days. The scheme also provides a one-year partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers who are willing and able to gradually resume normal repayment.\n\nThe original text is a concise announcement regarding the \"中小企融資擔保計劃\" (Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme), which has introduced optimized measures effective April 1 and extended the application period to June 30, 2023.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"enhanced measures\" and \"application period to June 30, 2023.\" However, \"SME\" is used without quotation marks, which may be less formal than the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses the full name with quotation marks, which is more consistent with the original. \"Optimized measures\" is appropriate, and \"effective from April 1\" is slightly more natural than \"effective April 1st.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, with the full name in quotes and \"optimized measures.\" The use of \"April 1st\" is slightly less common in formal writing than \"April 1.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"SME Loan Guarantee Scheme\" instead of \"Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term. Also, \"will extend\" is less precise than \"has extended.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Identical to the third, with the full name in quotes and \"optimized measures.\" The use of \"effective from April 1\" is slightly more natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses the full name with hyphens and quotation marks, which is more consistent with the original. \"Enhanced measures\" is a good synonym for \"優化措施.\" However, \"until June 30, 2023\" is slightly less direct than \"to June 30, 2023.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name of the scheme with quotation marks for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"optimized measures\" or \"enhanced measures\" as appropriate, with \"enhanced\" being slightly more natural in this context.\n- Use \"effective April 1\" without the \"st\" for consistency with formal writing.\n- Use \"extended the application period to June 30, 2023\" for clarity and directness.\n**Improved Translation:**\n\"The 'Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme' has also introduced enhanced measures (effective April 1) and extended the application period to June 30, 2023.\"\n\n# April 1st\n\nThe original Chinese text is concise and formal, conveying that two regulatory bodies have introduced measures to enhance customer protection in relation to the use of premium financing for purchasing life insurance policies.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the two regulatory bodies and the purpose of the measures. However, it uses \"regulating the use of premium financing\" which slightly alters the original meaning, implying regulation rather than simply addressing the use of premium financing.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. The phrase \"against the misuse of premium financing\" adds a nuance not explicitly present in the original, which may not be necessary unless the original implies misuse.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and clear. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"IA\" for brevity, which is appropriate in formal contexts. The phrase \"regarding the use of premium financing\" is more neutral and closer to the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very similar to the third, with the only difference being \"for the purchase of\" instead of \"to purchase.\" Both are correct, but \"for the purchase of\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is problematic. \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" and \"Insurance Supervisory Administration\" are not the correct names of the regulatory bodies in Hong Kong. The original refers to the \"金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) and \"保險業監管局\" (Insurance Authority), not the entities mentioned here. Additionally, \"whole life insurance policies\" is more specific than the original \"life insurance policies.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in meaning but slightly wordy. The phrase \"strengthening safeguards against the use of premium financing\" is more complex than necessary and may obscure the original message.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, concise, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should correctly identify the regulatory bodies, use appropriate terminology, and avoid adding unnecessary nuance or complexity. The third and fourth translations are the closest to the original in terms of accuracy and fluency. However, the fourth version uses \"for the purchase of\" which is slightly more formal and precise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) have introduced measures to enhance customer protection regarding the use of premium financing for the purchase of life insurance policies.\n\n# April 14\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 4月14日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section marker. The junior translators have all captured the core information accurately, translating the date \"4月14日\" as \"April 14\" or \"April 14th.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first five translations omit the \"#\" symbol, which may be important depending on the context. The fifth translation includes the \"#\" symbol but adds \"th\" to the date, which is not typically used in formal or standard English date formats unless it's part of a list or enumeration. The use of \"April 14th\" is grammatically correct but less common in formal writing compared to \"April 14.\"\nThe best approach would be to retain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading or section marker, and to use the standard date format \"April 14\" without the ordinal suffix \"th,\" as it is more natural in English and commonly used in formal contexts.\nThus, the most appropriate translation would be:\n# April 14\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of guidelines to banks to assist residents in reactivating their mainland bank accounts under quarantine restrictions due to the pandemic. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice, prepositions, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (HKMA), the action (issued guidelines\/guidance), the recipients (Hong Kong banks), and the purpose (assisting residents in reactivating mainland bank accounts).\n- The use of \"quarantine restrictions\" and \"pandemic\/epidemic\" is appropriate, though \"pandemic\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The verbs \"restart\" and \"reactivate\" are both acceptable, though \"reactivate\" is slightly more precise in a banking context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"guidelines\" consistently, while others use \"guidance,\" which is slightly less formal and may not be the exact term used by the HKMA.\n- The second translation uses \"citizens\" instead of \"residents,\" which is less precise in this context.\n- The fourth translation uses \"mainland Chinese bank accounts,\" which is redundant since \"mainland\" already implies China.\n- The fifth translation uses \"banks in Hong Kong\" instead of \"Hong Kong banks,\" which is slightly less concise.\n- The sixth translation is very close to the original but uses \"guidance\" instead of \"guidelines.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"guidelines\" as it is the exact term likely used by the HKMA.\n- Use \"residents\" rather than \"citizens\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"reactivate\" for precision in a banking context.\n- Use \"pandemic\" for consistency with formal terminology.\n- Use \"Hong Kong banks\" for conciseness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to Hong Kong banks on assisting Hong Kong residents in reactivating their mainland bank accounts under quarantine restrictions implemented due to the pandemic.\n\n# April 26\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date format. The first and sixth translations use \"# April 26,\" which is consistent with the original format. The second, third, fourth, and fifth translations use \"April 26th\" or \"April 26,\" which are also acceptable date formats in English.\nHowever, the original text includes a hashtag, which is commonly used in social media and online platforms to categorize or tag content. The most accurate translation would preserve this format. While \"April 26\" and \"April 26th\" are both grammatically correct, \"April 26th\" is more commonly used in American English, while \"April 26\" is more common in British English. However, since the original text does not include the \"th\" suffix, it is more appropriate to use \"April 26\" to maintain consistency with the original format.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be \"# April 26,\" which accurately reflects the original text's format and content.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching a platform to foster knowledge and experience sharing within the compliance technology (RegTech) ecosystem. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, using \"compliance technology\" consistently and correctly. However, \"enhance the sharing of experience and specialized knowledge\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very similar to the first but uses \"enhance experience and knowledge exchange\" instead. While still correct, \"experience and knowledge exchange\" is slightly less precise than \"sharing of experience and specialized knowledge.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is very close to the first, with the only difference being \"applying compliance technology\" instead of \"in the application of compliance technology.\" The former is more concise and natural in English.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation uses \"RegTech\" instead of \"compliance technology,\" which is acceptable but may be less familiar to some readers. It also uses \"within Hong Kong’s RegTech ecosystem regarding the application of RegTech,\" which is slightly awkward and less direct than the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate, using \"RegTech\" consistently and \"expertise\" instead of \"specialized knowledge.\" It is a strong translation, though \"expertise\" may be slightly broader than the original's \"specialized knowledge.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very similar to the first, using \"applying compliance technology\" and \"expertise\" instead of \"specialized knowledge.\" It is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and accurate. It should use either \"compliance technology\" or \"RegTech\" consistently, and it should reflect the original's emphasis on \"experience and specialized knowledge exchange.\" \"Expertise\" is a good synonym for \"specialized knowledge,\" but \"experience and specialized knowledge\" is more precise in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the \"Compliance Technology Information Platform\" to encourage the Hong Kong compliance technology ecosystem to enhance the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in applying compliance technology.\n\n# April 28\nThe original text is simply a date written in Chinese format, \"# 4月28日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, primarily differing in the use of \"April 28th\" versus \"April 28\" and the presence of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the translations:\n- The use of \"April 28th\" is grammatically correct in English when referring to a specific date, but it is not necessary in all contexts. In formal or written English, \"April 28\" is often preferred, especially when the date is used in a list or as a heading.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement or context that was not provided.\n- All translations are accurate in terms of conveying the date, but they vary in style and formality.\nReasoning for improvement:\n- The most appropriate translation would be \"April 28\" as it is concise, formal, and commonly used in English for such contexts.\n- The \"#\" symbol should be omitted unless it is explicitly required for formatting or context, which is not indicated in the original text.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is \"April 28\".\n\nThe original Chinese text is concise and informative, announcing a joint initiative between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the banking industry to expand the talent pool in rapidly growing areas of the banking sector through a graduate training program.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the core message. However, it uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" instead of the correct \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is a critical error in terminology. The phrase \"the industry's rapidly growing areas\" is slightly vague and could be more precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"joint initiative\" effectively. However, the phrase \"aiming to expand the talent pool in the rapidly growing sectors of the banking industry\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"aimed at expanding the talent pool in the sector's rapidly growing areas.\" The use of \"sector\" is appropriate and consistent with the original text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The term \"Monetary Authority\" is too generic and lacks specificity. The phrase \"Banking Graduates Training Program\" is slightly less precise than \"Banking Industry Graduate Training Program.\" The translation is otherwise clear but lacks the specificity of the HKMA.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and well-structured translation. It correctly identifies the HKMA, uses \"Banking Sector Graduate Training Scheme\" (which is a common term in such contexts), and clearly conveys the purpose of the initiative. The phrase \"rapidly growing areas within the banking sector\" is precise and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Banking Graduates Training Program\" instead of \"Banking Industry Graduate Training Program,\" which is slightly less precise. The phrase \"rapidly growing areas of the banking industry\" is acceptable but slightly less concise than \"rapidly growing areas within the banking sector.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- Use precise and commonly accepted terminology, such as \"Banking Industry Graduate Training Program\" or \"Banking Sector Graduate Training Scheme.\"\n- Be concise and natural in English, avoiding unnecessary wordiness.\n- Ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness in the context of financial and professional training programs.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the launch of the Banking Sector Graduate Training Scheme, jointly initiated with the banking industry, to expand the talent pool for the rapidly growing areas within the banking sector.\n\n# May 5th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headlines or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting that could affect consistency and clarity.\nThe first, second, third, sixth, and fifth translators all used \"May 5th,\" which is a standard and natural way to express the date in English. However, the fourth translator used \"# May 5,\" which omits the \"th\" and the hashtag is unnecessary unless the text is part of a social media post or a specific formatting requirement. The fifth translator used \"# May 5th,\" which includes the hashtag but still omits the space between the hashtag and the date, which is not standard in formal writing.\nThe best translation should maintain the clarity and simplicity of the original while adhering to standard English date formatting. Since the original text includes a hashtag, it should be preserved in the translation. However, the space between the hashtag and the date should be included for proper formatting.\nTherefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"# May 5th,\" which maintains the hashtag, the correct date format, and proper spacing.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) approval of a \"mandatory background check program\" implemented by two key associations in the banking sector, aimed at addressing the recurring issue of unscrupulous individuals (\"rolling bad apples\") in the industry.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Depositors' Compensation Scheme Association,\" which is not a standard term for the relevant organization. The term \"rolling bad apple\" is used, which is acceptable but slightly less idiomatic than \"rolling bad apples.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is more precise with \"Deposit-taking Companies Association,\" which is a more accurate name for the organization. However, it repeats \"Banking Association\" in parentheses, which is redundant.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version, using \"HKMA\" and \"Deposit-taking Companies Association.\" However, it uses \"recognized\" instead of \"approved,\" which slightly changes the nuance of the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The term \"rotten apple\" is less idiomatic than \"bad apple\" and may not convey the intended meaning of \"rolling bad apples.\" Also, \"Deposit Protection Company Association\" is not a standard name.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"HKAB\" and \"Association of Deposit-Taking Companies,\" which are accurate. It also uses \"rolling bad apples\" correctly. However, it uses \"scheme\" instead of \"program,\" which is a minor variation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"HKAB\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit-Taking Companies Association,\" which are precise. It also uses \"rolling bad apples\" and \"scheme\" appropriately.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use accurate and standard names for the organizations, maintain the idiomatic expression \"rolling bad apples,\" and use the correct terminology (\"scheme\" or \"program\" are both acceptable, but \"scheme\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts). It should also be concise and fluent, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has approved a \"Mandatory Background Check Scheme\" to be implemented by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) and the Hong Kong Deposit-Taking Companies Association, designed to address the issue of \"rolling bad apples\" within the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\n# May 6th\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding a loan program for property owners affected by a temporary suspension of rent recovery arrangements. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. \"Concessionary Loan Scheme\" is a suitable term for \"特惠貸款計劃.\" However, \"rent recovery arrangements\" is slightly vague and could be more precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Privilege Loan Program\" is not a standard term in financial contexts. \"Privilege\" is more commonly used in non-financial contexts, making this translation less appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Personal Special Loan Scheme\" is not a standard term. \"Debt relief arrangements\" misrepresents the original, which refers to a suspension of rent recovery, not debt relief.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Rent arrears repayment arrangement\" is overly specific and not directly supported by the original text. \"Temporary rent arrears repayment arrangement\" introduces a nuance not present in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Deferred rent collection arrangement\" is a more accurate and natural phrasing than \"rent recovery arrangements.\" However, \"Privilege Loan Scheme\" is still not ideal in a financial context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Deferred collection of rent arrears arrangement\" is overly wordy and not idiomatic. \"Personal Special Preferential Loan Program\" is unnecessarily complex and not standard.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use standard financial terminology, maintain the formal tone of the original, and accurately reflect the meaning of \"暫緩追討欠租安排\" as a temporary suspension of rent recovery, not debt relief or repayment. \"Concessionary Loan Scheme\" is the most appropriate term for \"特惠貸款計劃.\" \"Rent recovery arrangements\" is a standard term in property and housing contexts. The phrase \"until October 31\" is more concise and natural than \"until October 31st.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"100% Guaranteed Individual Concessionary Loan Scheme\" is now accepting applications from individual property owners affected by the temporary suspension of rent recovery arrangements, until October 31.\n\n# May 25th\n\nThe original text is a concise statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a report on a reward system in retail banking to promote a sound banking culture. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the HKMA and accurately conveys the purpose of the report. However, it uses \"thematic review\" instead of \"special assessment,\" which may not fully capture the nuance of the original term. It also uses \"further promote\" instead of \"continue promoting,\" which is slightly less direct.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct authority in this context. The term \"thematic evaluation\" is appropriate, and \"continuously promote\" is a good choice.\n**Translation 3** is accurate in terms of content and structure. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and includes the full title of the report in English. However, it uses \"published the English version of the report\" which is slightly wordy and less natural than \"published the report in English.\"\n**Translation 4** is accurate and natural in tone. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and includes the report title. The phrase \"stable and sound culture\" is slightly more elaborate than necessary, but it is not incorrect. The use of \"frontline departments\" is appropriate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"HKMA\" correctly and includes the report title. However, it uses \"Special Study\" instead of \"Special Assessment,\" which may not be the most accurate term. The phrase \"incentive systems\" is slightly broader than \"reward system\" in the original.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 4 and is also accurate. It uses \"Special Assessment\" and \"stable and sound culture,\" which are both appropriate. However, it repeats the phrase \"frontline departments\" in the title and the main text, which is slightly redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for the authority (HKMA), accurately reflect the title of the report, and use natural, concise language. The phrase \"Special Assessment\" is more precise than \"Special Study\" or \"Thematic Review.\" The term \"sound banking culture\" is more direct and commonly used than \"stable and sound culture.\" The phrase \"continue promoting\" is more natural than \"further promote\" or \"continuously promote.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has published the report titled \"Special Assessment on the Reward System for Frontline Departments in Retail Banking\" (in English) to continue promoting a sound banking culture.\n\n# May 27th\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of new regulatory documents to strengthen oversight of trust businesses in Hong Kong. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in terms of terminology, fluency, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, \"Trust Business Operation Guidelines\" may not be the most precise term for the original Chinese, which is more likely referring to a \"Code of Conduct\" or \"Operational Guidelines.\" Also, \"regulation and supervision\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is concise but misrepresents the original by using \"new sections of the Trust Business Operations Guidelines\" instead of a new unit or section of the \"Regulatory Policy Handbook.\" The term \"related\" is also not clearly defined.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Operational Guidelines for Trust Business Operations,\" which is a more natural phrasing. It also correctly refers to \"a new section in the Regulatory Policy Manual.\" However, it omits the word \"related\" which is present in the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"Supervisory Policy Manual\" instead of \"Regulatory Policy Manual,\" which may not be the exact title used by the HKMA. Also, \"enhance\" is a good synonym for \"strengthen,\" but \"trust business\" is singular, which may not match the original's plural form.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation introduces \"Trust Business Operations Manual\" and \"Supervisory Policy Manual,\" which may not be the exact titles of the documents. It also uses \"new chapter\" instead of \"new section,\" which may not be accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"Code of Conduct for Trust Business Operations,\" which is a more appropriate term for the original Chinese. It also correctly refers to \"a new section of the Regulatory Policy Manual\" and uses \"enhance\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original terminology, maintain the formal tone, and ensure clarity. The original mentions \"《信託業務營運守則》\" which is best translated as \"Code of Conduct for Trust Business Operations\" or \"Operational Guidelines for Trust Business.\" It also refers to \"《監管政策手冊》新單元,\" which should be translated as \"a new section of the Regulatory Policy Manual.\" The verb \"加強規管與監管\" is best rendered as \"to strengthen the regulation and supervision.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued the \"Code of Conduct for Trust Business Operations\" and a new section of the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" to strengthen the regulation and supervision of trust businesses in Hong Kong.\n\n# May 31st\n\nHong Kong Annuity Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mortgage Securities Company, has announced enhancements and promotional incentives for the Hong Kong Annuity Plan. The enhancements include increasing the upper limits for the \"special withdrawal amount for medical and dental expenses\" and the \"total individual premium amount.\"\n\n# June 23\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the release of fintech application assessment results and related work plans to support the industry's adoption of fintech. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to official terminology.\n**Translation 1** is clear and concise, using \"HKMA\" which is a commonly accepted abbreviation. However, it lacks the full name of the authority, which may be important in formal contexts.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of the full name, which is less precise. It also uses \"adoption\" correctly, but the phrasing \"support the industry in adopting\" is slightly less direct than \"support the industry's adoption.\"\n**Translation 3** is the most comprehensive, using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and including \"along with a related action plan,\" which adds clarity. The use of \"its\" to refer to the HKMA's assessment is also appropriate.\n**Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is not the correct name of the authority in question. This is a significant error in terminology.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and concise, using the full name of the authority and the correct terminology. It is slightly more direct than Translation 3 but lacks the additional clarity of \"along with a related action plan.\"\n**Translation 6** is also accurate but uses \"application of financial technology\" instead of \"adoption,\" which is slightly less idiomatic in this context.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the full name of the authority, include the phrase \"along with a related action plan\" for clarity, and use \"adoption\" to reflect the intended meaning. It should also maintain a formal and professional tone consistent with the original text.\nThe final translation should be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has released the results of its assessment on fintech applications, along with a related action plan, to further support the industry’s adoption of financial technology.\n\n# July 1st\nThe original text is a simple date, \"7月1日,\" which translates directly to \"July 1st\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, with only minor variations in formatting.\nThe first junior translator wrote \"July 1st\" without the hashtag, which is appropriate if this is a standalone date. However, the original text includes a hashtag, so this may be a formatting oversight.\nThe second junior translator used \"# July 1\" — this is slightly off in terms of date formatting, as \"July 1\" is not the standard way to write the date in English. It should be \"July 1st\" to reflect the ordinal nature of the day.\nThe third and sixth junior translators both used \"# July 1st,\" which is the most accurate translation in terms of both content and formatting, matching the original text exactly.\nThe fourth and fifth junior translators used \"July 1st\" without the hashtag, which is correct if the hashtag is not necessary for the context. However, since the original includes a hashtag, it may be important to retain it depending on the intended use of the text.\nIn terms of fluency, grammar, and cultural appropriateness, all translations are acceptable. However, the most accurate and consistent translation would be \"# July 1st,\" as it mirrors the original text's structure and formatting. This is especially important if the text is being used in a context where hashtags are standard, such as social media or headings.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement regarding the implementation of a regulatory rule. The goal is to convey the rule's purpose and its effective status in a clear, precise, and natural manner in English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"enacted to implement\" is appropriate, and the title of the Basel Committee document is correctly quoted. The only minor issue is the use of \"have come into effect\" which is slightly more passive than necessary, but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The structure is slightly awkward with \"came into effect to implement\" which reverses the logical flow. The title of the Basel document is correctly quoted, but the sentence structure is less formal and less precise than the first translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the first translation, with \"formulated\" instead of \"enacted.\" \"Formulated\" is slightly less common in legal contexts than \"enacted\" or \"implemented,\" but it is still acceptable. The sentence is otherwise well-structured.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The translation is accurate, but the phrase \"equity investments in funds\" is slightly less precise than \"equity investments in funds\" as used in the original. The use of \"formulated\" is again less common in legal contexts. The sentence is otherwise clear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"enacted\" and \"have come into effect,\" which are both appropriate in legal contexts. The phrasing is concise and natural. The only minor issue is the omission of quotation marks around the Basel document title, which is not critical but slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a significant issue: \"Bank Investments in Fund Shares\" is not an exact match for the original Chinese, which refers to \"bank's equity investments in funds.\" The term \"Fund Shares\" is not standard in this context and may mislead readers. The sentence is otherwise clear but suffers from a critical inaccuracy in terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use formal legal language, accurately reflect the original terminology, and maintain a clear and natural flow. \"Enacted\" is more commonly used in legal contexts than \"formulated.\" The Basel document title should be in quotation marks to indicate it is a specific document. The phrase \"equity investments in funds\" should be used as in the original to ensure clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 2022 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules, enacted to implement the Basel Committee's \"Capital Requirements for Banks' Equity Investments in Funds,\" have come into effect.\n\n# July 6th to 8th\n# July 6–8\nJuly 6th to 8th\n# July 6th to 8th\nJuly 6th to 8th\nJuly 6th to 8th\nThe original text is a simple date range: # 7月6至8日. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate but vary slightly in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, third, fifth, and sixth translations all use \"July 6th to 8th,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English. However, the use of \"6th\" is somewhat redundant in this context, as \"July 6\" is more commonly used in English without the ordinal suffix, especially in formal or written contexts.\nThe second and fourth translations use the en dash (6–8) and retain the hashtag (#), which is appropriate if the format is intended to mirror the original's use of a hashtag. However, the en dash is more commonly used in English for date ranges, and the hashtag may be unnecessary unless it's part of a specific stylistic or platform requirement.\nThe main issue across all translations is the lack of consistency in formatting. Some use the ordinal form (\"6th\"), while others use the numerical form (\"6\"). Additionally, the hashtag is inconsistently applied.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain consistency in formatting and ensure that the translation is both accurate and natural in English. The use of the en dash is preferred for date ranges in English, and the hashtag can be retained if it is stylistically appropriate.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be: # July 6–8. This format is concise, natural, and maintains the original's use of a hashtag while using the en dash for the date range, which is standard in English.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) involvement in a regional crisis simulation exercise, emphasizing collaboration among 10 institutions from the Asia-Pacific region. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"participated in the design and conduct\" and \"aiming to strengthen cross-border cooperation.\" However, it uses \"exercise\" twice, which could be slightly repetitive.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate, with \"execution\" as a synonym for \"conduct.\" It uses \"agencies\" instead of \"institutions,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2, but uses \"enhance\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is a minor stylistic choice. It is fluent and accurate.\n**Translation 4** restructures the sentence to say \"institutions from the Asia-Pacific region, including...\" which is slightly more complex but still clear. It uses \"aimed at strengthening,\" which is slightly less direct than \"aiming to strengthen.\"\n**Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error in terminology.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is ambiguous and less precise.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"design and conduct\" or \"design and execution\" as both are acceptable, but \"conduct\" is more commonly used in this context.\n- Use \"aiming to strengthen\" for directness and clarity.\n- Ensure that \"deposit insurance institutions\" is used consistently, as it is the standard term in financial contexts.\n- Avoid repetition of \"exercise\" if possible.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) participated in the design and conduct of a three-day regional crisis simulation exercise. The exercise involved 10 central banks, regulatory and resolution authorities, and deposit insurance institutions from the Asia-Pacific region, aiming to strengthen cross-border cooperation.\n\n# July 8th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The translations provided by the junior translators are all accurate in terms of content, as they correctly translate “7月8日” into “July 8th.” However, there are minor differences in formatting that could be considered for consistency and stylistic appropriateness.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translators included the “#” symbol before the date, while the others did not. The use of the “#” symbol is not standard in English date formatting and may be interpreted as a hashtag or a section heading marker, which could be misleading depending on the context. In most cases, especially in formal or neutral contexts, the “#” symbol is unnecessary and should be omitted unless it serves a specific stylistic or functional purpose.\nThe translations are otherwise grammatically correct and fluent. The choice of “July 8th” is appropriate for an English-speaking audience, as it follows the standard format for dates in the month-day format used in English-speaking countries.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain clarity and consistency with standard English conventions. Since the original text is a simple date, the most appropriate translation would be “July 8th” without any additional symbols unless the context specifically requires them. This ensures that the translation is both accurate and natural in English.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to authorized institutions on the sale of protection-type investment-linked life insurance, ensuring customer protection.\n\n# July 8th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles.

This ensures that the translation is both accurate and natural in English.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing guidelines to financial institutions based on a government report. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the issuing authority.\n- The reference to the report is accurately captured in all versions.\n- The core meaning of the sentence is preserved in each translation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The term \"stored value payment tools\" is more precise than \"value-added payment tool operators\" or \"stored value facilities operators.\" The original uses \"儲值支付工具持牌人,\" which directly translates to \"licensed holders of stored value payment tools.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"has issued\" (e.g., Translation 3 and 5), which is grammatically correct but less formal than \"issued\" in the context of official announcements.\n- **Consistency:** The term \"guidelines\" is used in some translations, while others use \"guidance.\" Both are acceptable, but \"guidelines\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **Report Title:** The original title includes \"2022年,\" which should be placed at the beginning of the title for clarity and consistency with official document naming conventions.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"licensed holders of stored value payment tools\" to match the precise terminology in the original.\n- Use \"guidelines\" as it is the more standard term in regulatory contexts.\n- Place the year \"2022\" at the beginning of the report title for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"issued\" without \"has\" to maintain a formal and concise tone.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks and licensed holders of stored value payment tools based on the key findings and related implications outlined in the Government's \"2022 Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report.\"\n\n# July 20\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) welcome of a new payment arrangement for residential property transfer transactions, introduced by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, with mortgage banks beginning to offer it on November 7.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association. The use of \"residential property transfer transactions\" is appropriate. However, \"payment arrangement\" could be more specific, such as \"payment method\" or \"transaction payment option.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate but slightly less formal. The phrase \"providing customers with more choices\" is a bit redundant and less precise than \"providing customers with an additional payment arrangement option.\" The date format is correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"Banking Association\" is slightly less specific than \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" but it is still acceptable. The date format \"November 7th\" is slightly less formal than \"November 7.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and concise translation. It correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association. The phrasing is clear and professional, with appropriate use of terms like \"residential property transfer transactions\" and \"payment arrangement.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation introduces a minor error by using \"re-mortgage transactions\" instead of \"transfer transactions.\" This could mislead the reader. Additionally, \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" is not the standard name for the organization, which is more commonly referred to as the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"mortgage refinancing transactions\" instead of \"residential property transfer transactions,\" which is a significant deviation from the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, use the correct official names, and maintain a professional tone. It should also use precise terminology and maintain clarity and fluency. Based on the above review, the fourth junior translator's version is the closest to the ideal, with only minor improvements possible.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority welcomes the Hong Kong Bankers' Association's announcement of providing an additional payment arrangement for residential property transfer transactions. Mortgage banks began offering this new property transaction payment arrangement on November 7.\n\n# July 21\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date format. The first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"July 21\" without the \"st\" suffix, which is acceptable in many contexts, especially in informal or digital formats. The third and sixth translations use \"July 21st,\" which is more formal and grammatically precise in written English. The second and fifth translations include the hashtag, which matches the original format.\nThe most consistent and appropriate translation would be to retain the hashtag and use the formal date format with the ordinal suffix. Therefore, the best translation is \"# July 21st.\"\n\nThe original text discusses a collaborative initiative between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Digital Harbour, with Deloitte's assistance, to host the second iteration of the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory (AMLab 2).\" The focus is on \"user-friendly technology\" that is low-threshold and easily implementable.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terms like \"user-friendly technology.\" However, \"Digital Harbour\" should be \"Digital Harbour\" (not \"Digital Harbor\") and \"co-hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"co-organized.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version correctly uses \"Cyberport\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is the official name of the organization. However, \"easier to implement and has lower thresholds\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"HKMA\" correctly and \"Digital Harbour\" appropriately. However, \"Tech Lab\" is less formal than \"Technology Laboratory.\" Also, \"lower implementation thresholds and easier deployment\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to \"RegTech\" instead of \"Compliance Technology,\" which misrepresents the focus of the initiative. Also, \"readily implementable\" is slightly less precise than \"easily implementable.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Digital Harbor\" (which is a variant spelling, though \"Digital Harbour\" is more common in official contexts). The phrase \"lower implementation barriers and easier to implement\" is slightly redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version incorrectly identifies the partner as \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is a significant error. It also uses \"lower in barriers to entry,\" which is less direct than \"low-threshold.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct official name: \"Digital Harbour.\"\n- Use the correct term: \"Compliance Technology\" rather than \"RegTech.\"\n- Use a formal and precise verb: \"co-organized\" or \"co-hosted.\"\n- Use clear and concise phrasing: \"low-threshold and easily implementable 'user-friendly technology.'\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Digital Harbour, with the assistance of Deloitte, co-organized the second \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory (AMLab 2),\" primarily focusing on \"user-friendly technology\" that is low-threshold and easily implementable.\n\n# September 2nd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced a series of consumer protection measures for banks' \"buy now, pay later\" products to promote responsible lending.\n\n# September 8\n\nThe original text is a concise announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the launch of a new online platform and a second edition of a course. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and concise, using \"Banking Navigation\" and \"Banking Bridging Course.\" However, it lacks the full name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\") and omits the definite article \"the\" before \"one-stop online resource platform.\"\nTranslation 2 improves on this by including the full name of the authority and using \"Navigator\" instead of \"Navigation,\" which may be more natural in English. It also uses \"cohort\" for the second offering of the course, which is appropriate in educational contexts.\nTranslation 3 uses \"Banking Industry Navigation\" and \"Banking Industry Transition Course,\" which are more verbose and less idiomatic than the other translations. The term \"Transition Course\" may not be the most commonly used term in this context.\nTranslation 4 is the most comprehensive, using \"Banking Sector Navigator\" and \"Banking Sector Bridging Programme.\" It also includes the acronym \"HKMA\" and uses \"iteration\" for the second offering, which is a slightly more formal and precise term.\nTranslation 5 is similar to Translation 3, using \"Banking Industry Navigation\" and \"Banking Industry Transition Program.\" It also omits the full name of the authority and uses \"Program\" instead of \"Course,\" which may be less appropriate in this context.\nTranslation 6 is similar to Translation 1 but includes the full name of the authority and uses \"Banking Bridging Course\" without the definite article \"the\" before it, which is slightly awkward.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would include the full name of the authority, use \"Banking Navigation\" or \"Banking Sector Navigator\" as the platform name, and use \"Banking Bridging Course\" for the course. It should also use \"second edition\" or \"second iteration\" for the course offering and ensure proper grammar and fluency.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the launch of a one-stop online resource platform called \"Banking Navigation\" and the second edition of the \"Banking Bridging Course.\"\n\n# September 16\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" announced the extension of the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme for three months until the end of January 2023.\n\nOn the same day, the Insurance Company announced that the \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Program\" also extended the interest-only repayment arrangement, allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for a delay in repaying the principal for a maximum of 36 months in total.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the original meaning. Here is a critical evaluation of each:\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"Insurance Company\" is vague and lacks specificity. The phrase \"allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for a delay in repaying the principal\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is more precise, using \"Amex Insurance\" (though not confirmed in the original) and \"deferral of principal repayment.\" However, the phrase \"has also been extended accordingly\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Mortgage Insurance Company\" is incorrect, as the original does not specify the type of insurance. \"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises\" is slightly more formal than the original, which uses \"中小企\" (SMEs). The phrase \"for a maximum total of 36 months\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Insurance Authority\" is incorrect; the original refers to a company, not a regulatory body. \"Principal repayment arrangement\" is not the exact term used in the original, which refers to an \"interest-only repayment arrangement.\" The phrase \"would also be extended accordingly\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation misrepresents the original by referring to a \"principal and interest repayment deferral arrangement,\" whereas the original only mentions an \"interest-only repayment arrangement.\" The phrase \"maximum deferral of 36 months for principal repayment\" is slightly unclear.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is the most accurate in terms of structure and meaning. It correctly identifies the \"interest-only repayment arrangement\" and uses \"apply for a maximum of 36 months to defer repayment of principal.\" However, \"Manulife Insurance Company\" is not confirmed in the original, and the phrase \"to defer repayment of principal\" could be more concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nOn the same day, the Insurance Company announced that the interest-only repayment arrangement under the \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Program\" has also been extended, allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for a deferral of principal repayment for a maximum of 36 months in total.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has finalized the implementation guidelines for the \"Fintech Practitioners Training Subsidy Pilot Program\" and officially launched the initiative within the banking sector.\n\n# September 27\n<\/think>\nSeptember 27\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate in conveying the core information of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, numerical formatting, and the names of the regulatory bodies, which affect the clarity and professionalism of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the regulatory bodies involved (SFC and HKMA) and the subject matter (sales of non-exchange-traded investment products).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data points (number of licensed corporations, registered institutions, transaction volume, and investor numbers) are accurately reflected.\n- The use of terms like \"licensed corporations\" and \"registered institutions\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term \"Insurance Authority (IA)\" in the first translation is incorrect; the correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not the Insurance Authority.\n- **Numerical Formatting:** There is inconsistency in how the transaction volume is presented. Some translations use \"HK$50,150 billion,\" while others use \"HK$5.015 trillion\" or \"501.5 billion HKD.\" The correct format should be \"HK$501.5 billion\" to match the original Chinese figure of 50,150億港元.\n- **Redundancy:** The phrase \"second annual joint survey results\" in the third and fifth translations is slightly redundant, as \"second annual joint survey\" already implies the results.\n- **Word Choice:** The use of \"investigation\" in translations 4 and 6 may be less appropriate than \"survey,\" as the original text refers to a \"調查\" (survey), not an \"investigation.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct regulatory body is used (HKMA, not IA or HKMA incorrectly paired with Insurance Authority).\n- Standardize the numerical format to \"HK$501.5 billion\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"survey\" rather than \"investigation\" to align with the original term.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"second annual joint survey\" without repeating \"results.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, with corrections to terminology, numerical formatting, and redundancy.\n---\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released the results of their second annual joint survey on the sale of non-exchange-traded investment products by licensed corporations and registered institutions. A total of 327 licensed corporations and 63 registered institutions reported data on their sales of investment products in 2021, with total transaction value reaching HK$501.5 billion. The number of participating investors increased by 5% to 770,000.\n\n# September 27\n<\/think>\nSeptember 27\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introducing a \"Compliance\" unit under the \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework\" in collaboration with the banking industry to develop transparent and commonly adoptable capability standards aimed at enhancing the professional competence of compliance practitioners.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"unit\" appropriately. However, \"collaborating with the banking industry to develop\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error. It also uses \"module\" instead of \"unit,\" which may not be the most accurate term in this context. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"HKMA\" in parentheses, which is good for clarity. It uses \"collaborate with the banking industry in developing,\" which is slightly more concise than the first translation. However, \"commonly adoptable by the industry\" is a bit awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"module\" instead of \"unit,\" which may be acceptable depending on the context. The phrase \"common, transparent capability standards that the industry can adopt\" is well-structured and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the first and is accurate. It uses \"in collaboration with the banking industry\" which is slightly more formal and appropriate for official statements. The structure is clear and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Banking Industry Competency Framework\" instead of the \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework.\" This is a significant inaccuracy. It also uses \"module\" and \"competency standards\" which are acceptable, but the framework name is incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, use appropriate terminology, and maintain a formal and professional tone. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the most accurate and fluent, with only minor improvements possible. The use of \"in collaboration with the banking industry\" is more formal and appropriate for an official statement. The term \"unit\" is more appropriate than \"module\" in this context, as it refers to a component of a framework. The phrase \"aiming to enhance the professional competence of compliance practitioners\" is clear and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a \"Compliance\" unit under the \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework\" in collaboration with the banking industry to develop a set of capability standards that can be jointly adopted by the industry and are transparent, aiming to enhance the professional competence of compliance practitioners.\n\n# October 6th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborating with various financial institutions and the police to launch a scam detection tool called “防騙視伏器” (Anti-Scam Vision Detector) to combat fraud and reduce public financial losses. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key stakeholders: the HKMA, the Hong Kong Bankers’ Association, banks, and the stored value payment tool industry.\n- The core message of supporting the police in launching a scam detection tool is preserved in all versions.\n- The phrase “to enhance the prevention, detection, and suppression of fraudulent activities in society and reduce public financial losses” is consistently used, which is accurate and clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The name of the tool, “防騙視伏器,” is translated inconsistently. Some versions use “Scam Spotter,” “Anti-Deception Trap Detector,” “Anti-Fraud Vision Detector,” “Anti-Scam Vision Tool,” and “Anti-Fraud Searcher – Fraud Detection Device.” The most accurate and consistent translation is “Anti-Scam Vision Detector,” which captures both the function (vision\/detection) and the purpose (anti-scam).\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward, such as “is supporting the Hong Kong Police Force in launching” (second translation), which is grammatically correct but less direct than “supports the Hong Kong Police Force in launching.”\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term “stored value payment tool industry” is more precise than “stored-value facilities payment tool industry” or “stored value payment industry,” which are either redundant or too vague.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following should be prioritized:\n- Use the most accurate and consistent name for the tool: “Anti-Scam Vision Detector.”\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English, avoiding redundancy or awkward phrasing.\n- Use precise terminology, such as “stored value payment tool industry” instead of vague alternatives.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for a government or regulatory announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the Hong Kong Bankers’ Association, banks, and the stored value payment tool industry, supports the Hong Kong Police Force in launching the “Anti-Scam Vision Detector” scam trap search tool to enhance the prevention, detection, and suppression of fraudulent activities in society and reduce public financial losses.\n\nIn addition to issuing practical guidelines and updating the relevant \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also collaborated with banks and the stored value payment tool industry to raise public awareness of fraud prevention through consumer education information on websites and social media platforms. It has also published articles in \"HKMA Insights\" to elaborate on this work.\n\n# October 20th\nThe original text is a simple date heading: \"# 10月20日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are essentially correct in terms of the date format. However, there are subtle differences in formatting and punctuation that are worth considering.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"October 20th\" with the ordinal suffix \"-th,\" which is standard in English for dates. The second and fifth translations include a \"#\" symbol, which matches the original Chinese format. The third translation omits the ordinal suffix, using \"October 20,\" which is less common in formal or written English but still acceptable in informal contexts.\nThe most notable issue is the use of the \"#\" symbol. In English, this symbol is typically used for headings or labels in lists, but it is not standard in date formatting. However, since the original Chinese text includes the \"#\" symbol, it may be important to retain it for consistency or stylistic reasons.\nThe ordinal suffix \"-th\" is more commonly used in British English, while American English often omits it in informal contexts. However, in formal or written English, including the ordinal is more precise and preferred.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would retain the \"#\" symbol to match the original format and include the ordinal suffix for clarity and formality. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"# October 20th.\"\n\nThe original text discusses an extension of a loan repayment relief program by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in collaboration with a specific coordination mechanism for SME loans. The goal is to assist capable businesses in gradually resuming normal repayment schedules.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday\" and \"normal repayment arrangements.\" However, \"Principal Payment Holiday\" may not be the most commonly used term in financial contexts, and \"arrangements\" feels slightly formal.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment,\" which is a more precise term than \"Principal Payment Holiday.\" The phrase \"gradually resume normal repayments\" is natural and clear.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The use of \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" is incorrect; the correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The term \"Principal and Interest Repayment Deferral\" is more complex than necessary and less commonly used than \"interest-only repayment.\" The phrase \"return to normal repayment schedules\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The term \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Payment\" is slightly off; \"Pre-approved\" is more standard in financial contexts. The phrase \"companies that are capable of gradually resuming normal repayments\" is a bit wordy and less direct than \"capable businesses.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"Pre-approved Interest-Only Repayment,\" which is a standard term. The phrase \"enterprises with the capacity to prepare for gradually resuming normal repayments\" is slightly wordy but still clear.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" and \"viable businesses,\" which are appropriate terms. The phrase \"prepare for a gradual return to normal repayment\" is natural and concise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use standard financial terminology, be concise, and maintain the original tone of official announcements. \"Pre-approved interest-only repayment\" is the most accurate and commonly used term. \"Capable businesses\" is more direct than \"viable businesses\" or \"enterprises with the capacity.\" The phrase \"gradually resuming normal repayments\" is natural and clear.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Loan Coordination Mechanism\" in the banking sector, announced the extension of the \"Pre-approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme for an additional six months until the end of July 2023, and optimized some principal repayment options to help capable businesses prepare for a gradual return to normal repayments.\n\nThe original text discusses an extension of the application period and the maximum repayment duration for a specific financial arrangement under the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.\" The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct but uses \"According to the insurance company,\" which is slightly awkward and lacks specificity regarding which insurance company is being referenced. It also uses \"repayment of interest but not principal,\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, using \"interest-only, no principal repayment arrangement\" effectively. It also correctly uses \"Anzhen Insurance Company,\" which is a specific entity, though the original text does not name the company, so this may be an error.\n**Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"interest-only repayment arrangement\" effectively. It also correctly names the scheme as \"Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme.\" However, it uses \"maximum duration\" instead of \"maximum repayment period,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"AIA Insurance Company,\" which again may not be the correct entity. It uses \"interest-only payment arrangement\" and \"maximum of 42 months in total,\" which is clear and natural.\n**Translation 5** is accurate but uses \"repayment without principal repayment arrangement,\" which is redundant and awkward. It also uses \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Program,\" which is slightly inconsistent with the original term \"Scheme.\"\n**Translation 6** introduces \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation,\" which is not mentioned in the original text, and uses \"principal repayment holiday arrangement,\" which is not the exact term used in the original. It also uses \"maximum tenor,\" which is less common in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct and consistent name for the insurance company (if known) or omit it if unspecified.\n- Use precise and natural terminology such as \"interest-only repayment arrangement.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in the sentence structure.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain consistency in the term used for the financial program (\"Scheme\" rather than \"Program\").\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English.\nThe Insurance Company also announced that the application period for the interest-only repayment arrangement under the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has been extended by six months to the end of June 2023, with the maximum repayment period extended by six months to a total of up to 42 months.\n\n# October 21st\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, typically written as \"# 10月21日\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are essentially correct in terms of the date itself. However, there are subtle differences in formatting and punctuation that can affect the perceived professionalism and clarity of the translation.\nThe first junior translator used \"# October 21st,\" which mirrors the original format exactly, including the \"#\" symbol. This is a strong choice if the \"#\" is intended to serve a specific formatting or structural purpose in the larger document. However, in many English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date headings unless it is part of a specific style guide or formatting convention.\nThe second and third junior translators used \"October 21\" without the \"st\" suffix. While this is grammatically acceptable in informal contexts, it is less precise than using the ordinal suffix \"st\" when referring to specific dates in formal or written English.\nThe fourth and fifth junior translators used \"October 21st,\" which is the most grammatically correct and natural way to express the date in formal English. It includes the ordinal suffix, which is standard in English for dates.\nThe sixth junior translator used \"# October 21,\" which is similar to the first translation but omits the \"st\" suffix. This is less precise than including the ordinal suffix, even though it maintains the \"#\" symbol.\nConsidering these variations, the best possible translation would be \"October 21st\" if the \"#\" symbol is not necessary for formatting purposes. If the \"#\" symbol is required to maintain the structure or style of the original document, then \"# October 21st\" would be the most accurate and natural translation. However, in most standard English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not used in date headings, so the most appropriate and natural translation would be \"October 21st.\"\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding regulatory updates. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. It also uses \"loss-making products,\" which is accurate but slightly less precise than \"loss-making investment products\" in the context of financial regulation.\n**Translation 2** correctly identifies the authority as the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"products designed to offset losses,\" which is a bit more interpretive than the original. The phrase \"notices\" is appropriate for regulatory updates.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"products to offset losses,\" which is slightly more direct and aligns better with the original wording. However, it combines the two clauses with \"and,\" which may slightly reduce clarity.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and wording. It uses \"loss-making products\" and \"notices,\" which are both appropriate. The phrasing is clear and concise.\n**Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"loss-compensating products,\" which is a less common term in financial regulation and may be confusing.\n**Translation 6** is accurate in identifying the authority and uses \"loss-making investment products,\" which is more precise in the financial context. It also uses \"notices\" and provides a clear structure.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, use precise financial terminology, and maintain the formal tone of the original. \"Loss-making investment products\" is more specific and appropriate in a regulatory context. \"Notices\" is the correct term for official regulatory updates. The structure should clearly separate the two purposes of the notices: updating requirements and providing guidance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued two notices to update the requirements related to the sale and distribution of loss-making investment products and to provide guidance on suitability assessments.\n\n# November 24th\n\nThe original text discusses a collaboration between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Digital Harbour (數碼港), and Deloitte to host the third iteration of the Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Lab (AMLab 3). The lab aims to use network analysis to address fraud risks and reduce losses from puppet account network scams.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies \"數碼港\" as \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation\" and uses \"dummy accounts\" for \"傀儡戶口.\" The structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"Digital Harbor\" is not the correct name for \"數碼港.\" It should be \"Digital Harbour\" or \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation.\" Also, \"puppet account\" is less common than \"dummy account\" in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Cyberport\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is incorrect. \"Cyberport\" is a different entity. The use of \"shell accounts\" is not standard in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation correctly uses \"Digital Harbour\" and includes the Chinese term \"傀儡户口\" in parentheses, which is unnecessary and disrupts the flow. The rest is accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority (FMA)\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" It also uses \"shell accounts,\" which is not the standard term for \"傀儡戶口.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"puppet account network scams.\" It is fluent and professional.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for \"數碼港\" (Digital Harbour), use \"dummy accounts\" instead of \"puppet accounts\" or \"shell accounts\" for \"傀儡戶口,\" and maintain a professional tone. It should also avoid unnecessary parenthetical explanations of Chinese terms in English text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with Digital Harbour and with the assistance of Deloitte, hosted the third \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Lab (AMLab 3).\" Building on the achievements of previous AMLab series, AMLab 3 utilizes network analysis to address fraud risks and reduce losses caused by dummy account network scams.\n\n# November 28\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 11月28日,\" where the \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or label. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English, with differences in the use of \"th\" and the presence of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in converting the date from Traditional Chinese to English. All translations correctly identify the date as \"November 28.\" However, there are some minor inconsistencies in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators omitted the \"th\" in \"28th,\" which is commonly used in English to denote the ordinal position of the day. The second, fourth, and fifth translators included \"28th,\" which is more in line with standard English date formatting. Additionally, the first, second, and sixth translators included the \"#\" symbol, while the third, fourth, and fifth did not. The presence or absence of the \"#\" symbol depends on the context in which the date is being used. If it is a heading or label, retaining the \"#\" is appropriate; otherwise, it may be unnecessary.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"November 28th\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and commonly used format in English for dates. The \"th\" suffix is standard in English for dates, and the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in this context unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement.\n\nWith the strong support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model has commenced operations, aiming to enhance the service standards of credit information service providers in Hong Kong and reduce the operational risks arising from the current market's reliance on a single commercial operator.\n\n# December 7th\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding a legislative draft. The goal is to convey the issuance of a notice to banks, explaining the latest amendments to a specific piece of legislation that will come into effect in June 2023.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"circular\" appropriately and correctly identifies the full name of the legislation. However, the phrase \"which will take effect in June 2023\" is slightly awkwardly placed, and the use of \"clarifying\" may not fully capture the intent of the original, which is more about explaining the amendments.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is fluent but has a convoluted structure. The phrase \"under the Draft Amendment Ordinance to the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Ordinance 2022\" is unnecessarily wordy and confusing. It also uses \"notice\" instead of \"circular,\" which is less precise in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate. It uses \"Bill\" instead of \"Ordinance,\" which is a minor but notable difference. The phrase \"which will take effect in June 2023\" is well-placed, and the use of \"clarifying\" is appropriate. However, \"Bill\" may not be the correct term for the legislative text in question.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the second one, with the same issue of using \"Draft Amendment Ordinance to the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Ordinance 2022,\" which is unnecessarily complex. It also uses \"revisions\" instead of \"amendments,\" which is less precise in a legal context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is clear and concise. It uses \"notice\" and \"explaining\" appropriately. However, it omits the word \"draft\" from the title of the legislation, which is important for clarity. It also uses \"concerning\" instead of \"regarding,\" which is slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"circular\" correctly, includes the word \"draft\" in the title of the legislation, and places the effective date appropriately. The phrase \"which will take effect in June 2023\" is well-placed, and the use of \"concerning\" is appropriate in a formal context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and grammatically correct. It should use the correct legal terminology, such as \"circular\" instead of \"notice\" or \"Bill\" instead of \"Ordinance\" if that is the correct term. It should also clearly indicate that the legislation is a \"draft\" and that it will \"take effect\" in June 2023. The phrase \"clarifying the latest amendments\" is appropriate, but \"explaining\" or \"detailing\" may be more precise in a formal context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued a circular to banks, explaining the latest amendments related to the banking sector under the draft \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Ordinance 2022,\" which will take effect in June 2023.\n\n# December 15th\nThe original text is a simple date heading, \"# 12月15日,\" which translates to \"December 15th\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, though there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth translations all use \"December 15th,\" which is the correct ordinal form in English. However, the fifth and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original Chinese text. This symbol is often used in digital or list formats to denote a heading or item, so retaining it may be appropriate depending on context.\nThe third translation, \"December 15,\" omits the \"th\" in the ordinal form, which is less standard in formal English writing. While it is not incorrect in informal contexts, it is less precise than \"December 15th.\"\nIn terms of cultural appropriateness, the use of the \"#\" symbol may be more common in digital or social media contexts, but in formal or written English, it is often omitted unless it serves a specific formatting purpose.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"December 15th,\" as it is the most standard and formal way to express the date in English. If the \"#\" symbol is necessary for formatting purposes, it could be retained as \"# December 15th,\" but this would depend on the intended use of the text.\n\nThe original text describes a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) for the banking and stored value payment tool industry, covering various aspects of anti-money laundering (AML) and related regulatory topics. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is concise and accurate, but it uses \"stored value payment tool\" without specifying the industry, which could be slightly ambiguous. It also omits the full term \"counter-terrorism financing\" in the title, which may be important for clarity.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"mitigating the risk\" instead of \"combating the risk,\" which slightly changes the nuance. The term \"stored-value payment instrument\" is more formal than \"stored value payment tool,\" which is acceptable but not necessarily better.\n**Translation 3** correctly uses \"HKMA\" and includes \"counter-terrorism financing\" in the title. However, it uses \"lecture\" instead of \"seminar,\" which is less common in this context. It also uses \"combating the risk\" consistently, which is appropriate.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original, using \"seminar\" and \"stored value payment instrument.\" It uses \"topics such as\" which is slightly informal, but acceptable. It also uses \"risks related to the financing of the proliferation\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 5** is the most comprehensive, using \"electronic payment institutions sector\" instead of \"stored value payment tool industry,\" which is a more accurate term. It also includes \"RegTech\" in parentheses, which adds clarity. However, it uses \"combating the financing of proliferation of WMDs\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 6** uses \"AML\/CFT\" and \"regtech\" without explanation, which may be confusing for some readers. It also uses \"stored value facility industries,\" which is not a standard term.\n**Improvements** would include using \"seminar\" instead of \"lecture,\" specifying the full name of the authority, using \"stored value payment tool industry\" or \"electronic payment institutions sector\" for clarity, and ensuring that terms like \"RegTech\" are either explained or used consistently. Also, the phrase \"combating the risk of financing the proliferation\" should be simplified for clarity.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organized a seminar on combating money laundering and terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) for the banking and electronic payment institutions sector. The seminar covered updates on regulatory requirements, AML regulatory technology (RegTech) and compliance technology, regulatory requirements regarding the source of wealth, feedback on suspicious transaction reports, and updates on combating the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\n\n# December 23\nThe original text is simply a date written in Chinese format, \"# 12月23日\". The junior translators have all captured the core information accurately, but there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe first and second translations use \"# December 23\" which mirrors the original format exactly, including the hashtag. This is a direct and accurate translation, though the use of a hashtag may not be standard in all English contexts unless it's part of a specific format or platform requirement.\nThe third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"December 23rd,\" which is grammatically correct in English and commonly used in informal contexts. However, in formal or written English, the \"rd\" is often omitted unless it's necessary for clarity or stylistic preference.\nThe fourth translation, \"December 23,\" is the most neutral and standard form, commonly used in formal writing, calendars, and official documents. It avoids the informal \"rd\" suffix and maintains a clean, professional appearance.\nConsidering these options, the best translation would be \"December 23\" as it is the most universally acceptable format in formal and informal contexts, avoids unnecessary stylistic elements, and aligns with standard English conventions for writing dates.\n\nThe original text describes a joint initiative by three regulatory bodies in Hong Kong to inspect the sales practices of intermediaries for two tax-deductible products. The goal is to convey the nature of the inspection (a \"disguised customer check\" or \"mystery shopper\" program), the participating regulators, the products in question, and the outcomes (main results and good practices observed).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"customer impersonation check program.\" However, \"customer impersonation\" is slightly awkward and less commonly used than \"mystery shopper\" or \"disguised customer check.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is clear and accurate, using \"collaborative inspection plan\" and \"tax-deductible voluntary contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund.\" However, \"collaborative inspection plan\" is a bit vague and less precise than \"joint mystery shopper program.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"mystery shopper program,\" which is a standard term in regulatory contexts. However, \"sales tactics\" is slightly less precise than \"sales practices.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the products as \"taxable\" instead of \"tax-deductible,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"disguised customer inspection program,\" which is acceptable but less common than \"mystery shopper.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but introduces a minor inaccuracy by stating \"by three intermediaries\" instead of \"for two tax-deductible products by intermediaries.\" It also uses \"mystery shopping exercise,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"mystery shopper program.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is clear and accurate, using \"disguised customer check program\" and correctly identifying the products. However, \"sales methods\" is less precise than \"sales practices.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use standard regulatory terminology, such as \"mystery shopper program\" or \"disguised customer check program,\" and accurately reflect the nature of the products as \"tax-deductible.\" It should also clearly state that the inspection was conducted by the three regulators and that the focus was on the sales practices of intermediaries.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority jointly issued a circular outlining the key findings and observed good practices from their first joint mystery shopper program, which examined the sales practices of intermediaries in selling two tax-deductible products—qualified deferred annuity policies and tax-deductible voluntary contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund.\n\n# December 31\nThe original text is a simple date: \"12月31日\" which translates to \"December 31\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, most of which are correct but differ slightly in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations use \"December 31st,\" which is grammatically correct in English but less commonly used in formal or written contexts. The second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"December 31\" without the ordinal suffix, which is more standard in formal writing and aligns with the format typically used in calendars, headings, and official documents.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in translations 2 and 6 is unnecessary unless the original text was intended to be a heading or title. Since the original text is simply a date, the \"#\" should be omitted.\nThe best translation would be \"December 31,\" as it is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns with standard English conventions for writing dates in formal or neutral contexts.\n\nAll Hong Kong banks with local systemically important status have established a new layer of financial resources to absorb losses during resolution, marking a milestone for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in enhancing the feasibility of resolving such banks and strengthening the stability of the banking system.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's status as an international financial center.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are a few points worth noting:\n1. **Capitalization and Punctuation**: The first and fifth translations include the hashtag (#) symbol, which is not necessary in this context unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform. The use of a hashtag in the fifth translation is unnecessary and should be omitted for a formal or standard English translation.\n2. **\"Centre\" vs. \"Center\"**: The second translation uses \"Centre,\" which is the British English spelling. While both spellings are correct, \"Center\" is more commonly used in American English. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is associated with Hong Kong and the broader Chinese-speaking world, the choice between \"Centre\" and \"Center\" is largely a matter of style. However, for consistency with the majority of translations and to align with common usage in international financial contexts, \"Center\" is preferable.\n3. **Capitalization of \"Status\"**: All translations capitalize \"Status,\" which is appropriate as it is the title of the section. However, the sixth translation uses lowercase \"status,\" which is less formal and may be considered less appropriate for a title.\n4. **Punctuation and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically correct, with the exception of the sixth, which omits the possessive apostrophe in \"Hong Kong's.\" This is a minor but important detail for clarity and correctness.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the title format, use \"Center\" for consistency with the majority of translations, and ensure proper capitalization and punctuation. The hashtag should be removed, and the possessive form should be maintained for grammatical accuracy.\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\n# January 12\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in formatting that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first and sixth translations use the format \"# January 12,\" which includes a hashtag. This may be appropriate if the date is being used as a heading or label in a digital context, such as a social media post or a section title. However, if the goal is to translate the date in a neutral or formal context, the hashtag may be unnecessary.\nThe second, third, and fourth translations use \"January 12th,\" which is grammatically correct in English and commonly used in informal or conversational contexts. However, in more formal or written contexts, the \"th\" is often omitted, especially when the date is used as a heading or in a list.\nThe fifth translation, \"January 12,\" is the most neutral and widely acceptable format. It avoids the use of \"th\" and the hashtag, making it suitable for both formal and informal contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"January 12,\" as it is concise, grammatically correct, and appropriate for a wide range of contexts. It avoids unnecessary elements like the hashtag and the ordinal suffix \"th,\" which are not typically used in formal or standard date formats in English.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) releasing a discussion paper on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, outlining its regulatory framework, particularly for stablecoins used for payments, and inviting feedback from the industry and the public.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"discussion paper,\" and the phrasing \"conceptual framework for regulating cryptocurrencies\" is clear. However, \"inviting industry stakeholders and the public\" is slightly more formal than the original, which uses \"業界和公眾\" (industry and the public).\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and natural. The use of \"thinking on a regulatory framework\" is slightly more informal than \"conceptual framework,\" but still appropriate. The phrase \"inviting views from the industry and the public\" is slightly more concise than the first version.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate but slightly less formal. It uses \"released\" instead of \"has released\" and omits the parentheses for \"HKMA.\" The phrase \"conceptual regulatory framework\" is slightly awkward compared to \"conceptual framework for regulating.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation contains a critical error: it refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a factual inaccuracy. Additionally, \"digital assets\" is not the exact term used in the original, which is \"加密資產\" (cryptocurrencies).\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"issued\" instead of \"released,\" which is also correct. The phrase \"conceptual framework for the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies\" is slightly more elaborate but still accurate. The use of \"industry stakeholders\" is consistent with the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"issued\" and \"proposed regulatory approach,\" which are both appropriate. However, it omits the parentheses for \"HKMA\" and uses \"the relevant regulatory framework\" instead of \"the proposed regulatory framework.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should use the correct name for the authority (HKMA), use appropriate terminology (e.g., \"cryptocurrencies\" or \"crypto-assets\"), and maintain the structure of the original sentence. The phrase \"inviting industry stakeholders and the public to provide their views\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"inviting the industry and the public to provide feedback.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a discussion paper on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, outlining its conceptual framework for the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins used for payment purposes, and inviting industry stakeholders and the public to provide their views on the proposed regulatory model.\n\n# January 27\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in headlines or titles, particularly in digital or social media contexts. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with minor differences in formatting and the use of the ordinal suffix \"th.\"\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in conveying the date and consistency in the core content. However, there are notable weaknesses in terms of formatting and stylistic appropriateness. The use of the hashtag symbol (#) is not standard in English date formats and may be more appropriate in social media contexts rather than formal writing. Additionally, the inclusion of the ordinal suffix \"th\" is optional in English and is often omitted in titles or headings for brevity.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be a clean, concise, and standard English date format without unnecessary symbols or suffixes. \"January 27\" is the most appropriate and natural translation for this context.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about an online event co-hosted by two organizations. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the organizations, the nature of the event, and the fact that it was held online.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Swiss Federal Department of Finance's Directorate for International Financial Matters. However, \"Directorate\" may not be the most precise term for the Swiss organization, which is more commonly referred to as a \"Secretariat.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"Secretariat\" instead of \"Directorate,\" which is more appropriate for the Swiss organization. The phrase \"under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance\" is correctly placed to clarify the relationship between the Secretariat and the Department of Finance.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate but slightly less precise in naming the Swiss organization. It uses \"International Financial Affairs Secretariat,\" which is close but not the exact official name.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the second one, but it uses \"Swiss Federal International Financial Secretariat,\" which is not the correct name of the organization. The official name includes \"State Secretariat\" or \"Secretariat for International Financial Matters.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct name: \"Swiss State Secretariat for International Financial Matters.\" It also uses \"co-hosted,\" which is appropriate for a joint event.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct name: \"Secretariat for International Financial Affairs.\" However, \"co-hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"jointly hosted,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the most accurate and official name of the Swiss organization, which is the \"Swiss State Secretariat for International Financial Matters.\" It should also use \"co-hosted\" or \"jointly hosted\" to reflect the collaborative nature of the event. The phrase \"under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance\" should be included to clarify the organizational hierarchy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Swiss State Secretariat for International Financial Matters, under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, co-hosted the fifth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue online.\n\n# February\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been reappointed as Co-Chair of the Assessment and Compliance Subgroup under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for a two-year term. The Financial Action Task Force is the global standard-setting body on anti-money laundering.\n\n# February 11th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the correct date, but there are minor differences in formatting that could affect consistency and style.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations all use \"February 11th,\" which is the standard English format for dates when the day is written in full with the ordinal suffix. This is the most natural and commonly accepted format in English-speaking contexts.\nThe third translation, \"February 11,\" omits the ordinal suffix \"th,\" which is less common in formal or written English, though it may be acceptable in informal contexts or when space is limited.\nThe fifth translation, \"# February 11,\" includes a hashtag symbol, which is not typically used in formal date notation. This might be appropriate in social media or digital contexts, but it is not standard for general use.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"February 11th,\" as it is the most standard and natural format in English for written communication. It maintains clarity, consistency, and adheres to common usage norms.\n\nMortgage Securities Company announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with 14 partner banks to establish a framework for collaboration on infrastructure loans, outlining the main principles for such cooperation.\n\n# February 14th\nThe original text is a simple date, \"2月14日,\" which translates directly to \"February 14th\" in English. All the junior translators have captured the core meaning accurately, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the overall quality and appropriateness of the translations.\nThe first, second, third, and sixth junior translators have provided \"February 14th\" without any additional formatting, which is correct and natural in most contexts. However, the fourth and fifth translators included a hashtag (#) before the date, which may be appropriate in social media or digital contexts but is unnecessary in formal or general writing. The fifth translator also omitted the \"th\" in \"14th,\" which is grammatically incorrect in English when referring to a specific date.\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and contextually appropriate. Since the original text is a simple date without any additional context, the most neutral and accurate translation is \"February 14th.\" Including a hashtag or omitting the ordinal suffix would be unnecessary or incorrect in most cases. Therefore, the best translation is \"February 14th.\"\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement about the release of a research report by a specific institution under a faculty or school. The key elements to translate accurately are the name of the institution, its relationship to the faculty\/school, the title of the report, and the fact that it is an English version.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The term \"Faculty of Business\" is a direct translation of \"金融學院\" and is appropriate. The title is well translated, and the structure is clear. However, \"Faculty of Business\" may not be the exact name of the institution in English, which could be a minor issue.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"School of Finance\" instead of \"Faculty of Business\" may be inaccurate if the original refers to a \"Faculty\" rather than a \"School.\" The term \"Centre for Monetary and Financial Studies\" is slightly different from the original \"研究中心\" and may not be the official name.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The term \"Hong Kong Academy of Finance\" is not mentioned in the original text and is likely a fabrication. This is a significant error. The title is well translated, but the institution's name is incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original. It uses \"School of Finance\" and \"responsible for research work,\" which is accurate. The title is well translated, and the structure is clear. However, \"School of Finance\" may not be the exact name of the institution.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The term \"Monetary and Financial Centre\" is slightly different from the original \"研究中心\" and may not be the official name. The use of \"Population Change\" instead of \"Demographic Shifts\" is less precise. The phrase \"in Hong Kong\" is slightly less formal than \"for Hong Kong.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"responsible for research\" and \"School of Finance,\" which are appropriate. The title is well translated, and the structure is clear. The only minor issue is the use of \"School of Finance\" instead of \"Faculty of Finance\" or \"Faculty of Business,\" depending on the actual name.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the most accurate and official-sounding names for the institution and its relationship to the faculty or school. The term \"Faculty of Finance\" or \"Faculty of Business\" may be more appropriate than \"School of Finance.\" The title should use \"Demographic Shifts\" rather than \"Demographic Changes\" for precision. The phrase \"Opportunities and Development for Hong Kong\" is more natural than \"Opportunities and Development in Hong Kong.\" The use of \"published\" is more formal and appropriate for an academic report than \"released.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre, under the Faculty of Finance, has published a new applied financial research report titled \"Demographic Shifts and Long-Term Asset Markets: Opportunities and Development for Hong Kong\" (English version).\n\n# March 8\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original Chinese text, which is that the IMF has reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center due to its strong financial system, sound policies, and regulatory framework, even during the pandemic. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and structure that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the IMF as the organization involved and accurately convey the key points about Hong Kong's financial system and resilience.\n- The use of terms like \"robust and resilient financial system,\" \"effective macroeconomic and prudential policies,\" and \"sound regulatory and supervisory framework\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The mention of the pandemic's impact on the financial sector is well-handled in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"Fourth Article consultation\" instead of the standard \"Article IV consultation,\" which is the official term used by the IMF. This is a minor but important detail for accuracy.\n- **Fluency and Structure:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"The IMF mission team has issued an assessment report on the Fourth Review...\" which is less standard than \"The IMF mission published its assessment report on the 2022 Article IV Consultation...\"\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** A few translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"It also recognized the continued expansion...\" which can be streamlined for better flow.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** While all translations are neutral and professional, some could be more aligned with the formal tone typically used in IMF reports.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the standard term \"Article IV consultation\" consistently.\n- Ensure the structure is clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, consistent with the nature of the IMF report.\n- Ensure that the subject-verb agreement and sentence flow are natural in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that uses the correct terminology, maintains a clear and concise structure, and reflects the formal tone of an IMF report.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission published its assessment report on the 2022 Article IV Consultation with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, once again affirming Hong Kong’s status as a major international financial center. The report highlights Hong Kong’s robust and resilient financial system, effective macroeconomic and prudential policies, as well as a sound regulatory and supervisory framework. It also acknowledges that Hong Kong’s financial sector has continued to expand and develop despite the pandemic.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the tone of an official statement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (\"fund organization\") and the key actions (\"praised,\" \"acknowledged\/recognized\").\n- The phrase \"significant progress in addressing climate change\" is consistently and accurately rendered.\n- The term \"green and sustainable finance ecosystem\" is well translated, with only minor variations in the use of \"financial\" versus \"finance.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The term \"fund organization\" may be ambiguous. It could refer to a specific fund or a general organization. The third translation uses \"international financial institutions,\" which is more general and appropriate if the original is referring to a broad group of organizations.\n- The verbs \"acknowledged,\" \"recognized,\" and \"praised\" are all acceptable, but \"praised\" is more direct and commonly used in formal contexts, which aligns well with the original tone.\n- The adjectives \"continuous,\" \"relentless,\" \"sustained,\" \"persistent,\" and \"tireless\" all convey effort, but \"relentless\" and \"tireless\" are more vivid and impactful in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Fund organization\" should be clarified or replaced with a more general term like \"international financial institutions\" if the original is not referring to a specific entity.\n- \"Praised\" is more direct and appropriate than \"acknowledged\" or \"recognized\" in this context.\n- \"Relentless\" or \"tireless\" are more vivid than \"continuous\" or \"sustained.\"\n- \"Finance ecosystem\" is more natural than \"financial ecosystem\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nInternational financial institutions also praised Hong Kong's significant progress in addressing climate change and recognized the government's tireless efforts to strengthen the green and sustainable finance ecosystem.\n\n# March 30\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate identification of the entity: \"跨機構督導小組\" is consistently translated as \"Inter-Agency Task Force,\" \"Steering Group,\" or \"Oversight Group,\" which are all appropriate terms.\n- The key message—that the group has released a feasibility assessment and announced follow-up work—is well captured in all translations.\n- The term \"碳交易中心\" is consistently translated as \"carbon trading hub\" or \"carbon trading center,\" which is appropriate in this context.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- **Terminology Consistency**: The group is referred to with different titles: \"Task Force,\" \"Steering Group,\" \"Oversight Group.\" While all are acceptable, \"Steering Group\" may be more appropriate for a supervisory or guiding body, as implied by \"督導.\"\n- **\"Preliminary feasibility assessment\" vs. \"initial feasibility study\":** \"Assessment\" is more precise than \"study\" in this context, as the original uses \"評估.\"\n- **\"Follow-up work\" vs. \"follow-up actions\" vs. \"follow-up initiatives\":** \"Follow-up work\" is the most neutral and appropriate term here, as it reflects the ongoing efforts of the group.\n- **\"Development into\" vs. \"development as\":** \"Development as\" is more natural in English when referring to a role or status, such as \"a regional carbon trading hub.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"Steering Group\" to reflect the supervisory role, \"preliminary feasibility assessment\" for accuracy, and \"follow-up work\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance has released a preliminary feasibility assessment on opportunities for Hong Kong's carbon market. Based on the assessment results, the Steering Group has announced follow-up work to support Hong Kong's development as a regional carbon trading hub.\n\n# April 12th\n\nThe original Chinese text describes a collaborative online seminar hosted by two institutions, focusing on macroeconomic developments, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and the offshore RMB market, with a large number of participants.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The term \"co-hosted\" is appropriate, and the title of the seminar is well translated. However, \"a total of 840,000 online participants\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** The use of \"webinar\" is slightly more specific than \"seminar,\" which may be acceptable depending on context. The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The term \"Business School\" may not be the most accurate translation of \"金融學院\" (Financial Institute or School of Finance). \"Renminbi\" is correct, but \"over 840,000\" is slightly less precise than the original \"84萬人次\" (840,000 participants).\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The use of \"School of Finance\" is appropriate. \"Fed\" is a common abbreviation for the Federal Reserve, which is acceptable in this context. The translation is accurate and concise.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in terms of structure and terminology. It uses \"School of Finance\" and \"Renminbi,\" which are both accurate. The sentence structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** The use of \"co-organized\" is slightly less common than \"co-hosted\" in this context. \"Online participants\" is redundant since the event was online, but it is not incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English. It should use appropriate terminology for the institutions involved and avoid redundancy. \"Co-hosted\" is more natural than \"co-organized\" in this context. \"Federal Reserve\" is more formal and precise than \"Fed,\" though both are acceptable. \"Offshore RMB Market\" is more commonly used than \"Offshore Renminbi Market\" in financial contexts. The phrase \"attracting 840,000 participants online\" is slightly redundant, as the event was online, so \"attracting 840,000 participants\" is sufficient.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre, in collaboration with the School of Finance, co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Latest Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market,\" attracting 840,000 participants.\n\n# April 27\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol preceding the date. The junior translators have all captured the core information accurately, translating \"4月27日\" as \"April 27\" or \"April 27th.\" However, there are a few nuances to consider for a more polished and culturally appropriate translation.\nFirst, the use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is notable. In Chinese contexts, \"#\" is often used to denote a heading or a section title, similar to how \"##\" or \"###\" might be used in markdown formatting. However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in this way for dates unless it's part of a specific formatting convention (e.g., in social media or hashtags). Therefore, retaining the \"#\" in the translation may be misleading or unnecessary unless it serves a specific purpose in the context.\nSecond, the format of the date itself is worth considering. In English, both \"April 27\" and \"April 27th\" are acceptable, though \"April 27\" is more commonly used in formal or written contexts, while \"April 27th\" is more conversational. Since the original text is concise and lacks additional context, \"April 27\" is likely the most appropriate choice.\nThird, the translations provided by the junior translators are all technically correct, but they lack any stylistic or contextual refinement. Since the original text is brief and appears to be a heading or label, the English translation should reflect that same brevity and clarity.\nTaking these considerations into account, the best possible translation would be \"April 27,\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is not standard in English date formatting and may confuse readers. This translation is concise, accurate, and stylistically appropriate for the context.\n\nThe original Chinese text is a formal announcement regarding the release of a discussion paper by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on the introduction of a retail-level central bank digital currency (CBDC), referred to as the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD. The goal is to convey the policy and design considerations involved in this initiative and to solicit public opinion.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"seeking public opinion,\" which is appropriate for formal contexts. However, \"public opinion\" is slightly less precise than \"public feedback\" or \"public comments\" in the context of policy consultations.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** The title is translated as \"From a Policy and Design Perspective: The Digital Hong Kong Dollar,\" which is slightly awkward compared to the original Chinese title. The phrase \"seeks public opinion\" is acceptable but not as commonly used in formal policy documents.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in tone and structure. The use of \"soliciting feedback\" is more formal and appropriate for a policy consultation. However, the phrase \"for retail use in Hong Kong\" is slightly less direct than \"at the retail level in Hong Kong.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The title is translated as \"Looking at 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar' from the Perspectives of Policy and Design,\" which is a bit wordy and less direct than the original. The use of \"seeking public comments\" is appropriate, but the overall phrasing is slightly less concise.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** The title is translated as \"From the Perspective of Policy and Design on 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar',\" which is awkward and not in line with standard English title conventions. The phrase \"seeking public input\" is acceptable but less formal than \"seeking public feedback.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is very accurate and fluent. The title is translated as \"Policy and Design Considerations for 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar',\" which is concise and appropriate. The use of \"seeking public feedback\" is formal and suitable for the context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and accurately reflect the original intent. It should use standard terminology for policy consultations, such as \"seeking public feedback\" or \"soliciting public comments.\" The title should be direct and in line with standard English conventions for official documents. The phrase \"retail-level central bank digital currency\" is more precise than \"central bank digital currency for retail use.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has released a discussion paper titled \"Policy and Design Considerations for the 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar',\" outlining the key policy and design considerations involved in introducing a retail-level central bank digital currency (i.e., the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD) in Hong Kong, and is seeking public feedback.\n\n# May 3rd\n\nThe original text describes a collaborative event initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, in partnership with Standard Chartered Bank. The event is an online roundtable titled \"Green and Sustainable Capital Market Transformation.\"\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" and the participants. However, \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" may not be the exact name used in the original, which is \"綠色商業銀行聯盟\" — \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" is acceptable, but \"Green Banking Alliance\" might be more concise and commonly used in similar contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" instead of \"Green Business Banking Alliance,\" which is more concise. The title of the event is correctly translated as \"Green and Sustainable Capital Markets Transformation.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"conference\" instead of \"roundtable,\" which is slightly less precise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure. It uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" and correctly places the title in quotes. However, the phrase \"Green and Sustainable Capital Markets Transformation Roundtable\" is slightly awkward in English, as the title should be separated from the event type.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation, similar to the second. It uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" and \"roundtable conference,\" which is slightly more formal than \"roundtable discussion.\" The title is correctly translated.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation has a critical error — it incorrectly states that the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) launched the alliance, whereas the original text clearly states the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Additionally, the title is rephrased as \"Transforming Green and Sustainable Capital Markets,\" which is less precise than the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It correctly identifies the HKMA and IFC as the initiators and includes the event title in quotes. However, the phrase \"Transformation Roundtable on Green and Sustainable Capital Markets\" is slightly awkward in English and could be more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name of the organization (HKMA, not FSC).\n- Use the most concise and commonly used name for the alliance: \"Green Banking Alliance.\"\n- Accurately reflect the event title as given in the original.\n- Use natural English phrasing, such as \"roundtable discussion\" or \"roundtable conference.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in the sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Green Banking Alliance, initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation (a member of the World Bank Group), co-hosted an online roundtable discussion on \"Green and Sustainable Capital Market Transformation\" with Standard Chartered Bank.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","en":"# Key Work Priorities and Future Outlook for 2023\n\nDespite the generally high quality of the translations, there are subtle differences in fluency, precision, and nuance that can be refined. All translations accurately capture the core meaning of the original text, but some variations in word choice and phrasing affect readability and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations effectively convey the economic context, including the recovery in Hong Kong, the global banking pressures, and the potential for slower growth or recession.\n- The use of terms like \"ripple effects,\" \"tightening of monetary policy,\" and \"deglobalization\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and logical, maintaining the original's flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the collapse of several U.S. regional banks\" (first translation) or \"individual U.S. banks\" (third translation), which may not be as natural as \"some U.S. banks\" or \"certain U.S. banks.\"\n- The phrase \"could significantly slow global economic growth, or even trigger a recession\" (first translation) is slightly more verbose than necessary, while \"could likely lead to a slowdown or even a recession\" (third translation) is more concise and natural.\n- The use of \"drag down\" (fourth and fifth translations) is acceptable but less formal than \"weigh on\" or \"hinder.\"\n- The phrase \"built up over the years\" (third and fourth translations) is slightly more natural than \"built up over the years\" or \"built on years of.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural and idiomatic expressions, such as \"weigh on global trade\" instead of \"drag down global trade.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"central banks\" and \"monetary policy.\"\n- Use more concise phrasing where possible, such as \"could slow global economic growth or even trigger a recession\" instead of \"could significantly slow global economic growth, or even trigger a recession.\"\n- Maintain a consistent tone and avoid overly formal or repetitive structures.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nAlthough Hong Kong's economy showed signs of recovery in early 2023, the external environment remains challenging and uncertain. Recent pressures on the banking sectors in the United States and Europe, including the collapse of some U.S. banks in March 2023, have created ripple effects across global financial markets. Furthermore, the tightening of monetary policies by major central banks is likely to slow global economic growth or even trigger a recession in 2023. Meanwhile, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the persistent threat of deglobalization may continue to weigh on global trade and cause periodic volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, supported by its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey its commitment to monetary and financial stability.\n- The use of terms like \"remain vigilant,\" \"strive to identify emerging risks,\" and \"maintain sufficient flexibility\" is consistent across translations and effectively captures the original intent.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"safeguarding monetary and financial stability,\" while others use \"safeguarding currency and financial stability.\" The original text uses \"貨幣\" (currency), which is more specific than \"monetary\" in this context. However, \"monetary and financial stability\" is a standard term in financial policy discussions, so it may be acceptable depending on the intended audience.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"the Authority\" inconsistently, switching between \"the HKMA\" and \"the Authority.\" For consistency, it is better to use \"the HKMA\" throughout.\n- **Terminology:** The term \"Exchange Fund\" is used in some translations, while others use \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\" The correct term is \"Exchange Fund,\" as it is the official name used by the HKMA.\n- **Redundancy and Flow:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to...\" which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistent use of \"the HKMA\" throughout the translation.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" as the official term.\n- Ensure that the tone is formal and professional, suitable for a policy or official statement.\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places great emphasis on safeguarding currency and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to swiftly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and ensuring high liquidity.\n\n# The original Chinese text is a concise headline: # 金融體系保持穩定健全. The junior translators have provided several English translations, all of which are very similar in content but differ slightly in punctuation and capitalization.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate lexical choices (\"financial system,\" \"remains,\" \"stable,\" \"sound\") and a clear, direct rendering of the original message. All translations effectively convey that the financial system is in a stable and sound condition.\nWeaknesses include inconsistent use of punctuation and capitalization. For example, some translations include a hashtag (#) at the beginning, which may be appropriate if the text is intended as a social media post or headline, but it is unnecessary in formal writing. Others omit the hashtag entirely, which may be more suitable for a formal or academic context. Additionally, the capitalization of \"Financial System\" in one translation is overly formal and not typical in standard English headlines unless it is a proper noun or title.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to consider the intended context and audience. If the text is meant to be a formal headline or statement, the hashtag should be omitted, and the first letter of the first word should be capitalized, with the rest of the words in lowercase unless it is a title case. In standard English, headlines often use title case, but in this case, the phrase is short and simple, so sentence case may be more appropriate.\nBased on this reasoning, the best translation would be: \"The financial system remains stable and sound.\" This version is grammatically correct, fluent, and culturally appropriate for most contexts. It avoids unnecessary punctuation and capitalization, and it maintains the original message clearly and concisely.\nThe financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text, which is that the global economy faces significant uncertainties, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to monitoring developments and managing risks to ensure financial stability, which is essential for the continued provision of financial services and the normal functioning of Hong Kong’s economy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately capture the main ideas and maintain the formal tone appropriate for an official statement.\n- The use of terms like “remain vigilant,” “guard against potential risks,” and “maintain a stable and sound financial system” is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, preserving the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use “Monetary Authority” without specifying “Hong Kong,” while others use “Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).” The full name “Hong Kong Monetary Authority” is more precise and should be used consistently.\n- **Redundancy and word choice:** Some translations use “continuous provision” instead of “continued provision,” which is less idiomatic. Also, “critical financial services” is slightly more intense than “essential financial services,” which may not be the best fit for the original tone.\n- **Cultural and idiomatic expressions:** The phrase “the lifeline for maintaining the normal operation of Hong Kong’s economy” is somewhat awkward. A more natural expression would be “the lifeline of Hong Kong’s normal economic operation” or “the lifeblood of Hong Kong’s economy.”\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name “Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)” for clarity and consistency.\n- Use “continued provision” instead of “continuous provision” for better idiomatic flow.\n- Replace “lifeline for maintaining” with “lifeline of” or “lifeblood of” for more natural phrasing.\n- Ensure parallel structure and consistent terminology throughout the translation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against various potential risks to maintain a stable and sound financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of essential financial services and, therefore, the lifeblood of Hong Kong’s normal economic operation.\n\n# Stay Alert to Potential Risks\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all quite close in meaning and are grammatically correct. However, there are subtle differences in tone and formality that may affect the overall impact of the message.\n\"Stay Vigilant to Potential Risks\" and \"Stay Alert to Potential Risks\" are both strong and commonly used phrases. \"Vigilant\" implies a more sustained and watchful state, while \"alert\" suggests a readiness to respond quickly. \"Stay Alert to Potential Risks\" is slightly more dynamic and is often used in contexts where immediate action may be required.\n\"Stay vigilant about potential risks\" and \"Be vigilant about potential risks\" are also correct, but the use of \"about\" is less common in this context than \"to.\" \"Remain vigilant about potential risks\" is slightly more formal and is often used in official or professional settings.\nConsidering the nuances of the original Chinese phrase, which emphasizes the importance of being watchful and cautious, \"Stay Alert to Potential Risks\" is a strong and natural translation that conveys the intended message effectively. It is concise, clear, and appropriate for a wide range of contexts.\n\nIn 2023, uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of U.S. interest rates, along with pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and could lead to periodic volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, style, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (HKMA) and the key actions (monitoring, taking measures, studying, assessing).\n- The use of \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation is consistent in some translations, which is appropriate for a professional context.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"The HKMA\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for conciseness.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Matters\" and \"issues\" are both acceptable, but \"matters\" may sound more formal and precise in this context.\n- **Prepositions and Articles:** The use of \"in both local and external environments\" is slightly awkward; \"in both the local and external environments\" is more natural.\n- **Consistency in Abbreviation:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use the full name, which can be inconsistent in a formal document.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently once it has been introduced.\n- Use \"the\" before \"local and external environments\" for grammatical correctness.\n- Maintain a formal and concise tone without redundancy.\n- Ensure parallel structure and consistent terminology.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. It will also study matters that may affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with them.\n\n# Maintaining the Stability of the Banking System\n\nGiven the original text, the six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to formal tone, which are critical in professional and regulatory contexts.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main points: geopolitical tensions, central bank interest rate hikes, challenges for the banking sector, and the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in ensuring resilience and regulatory improvements.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key terms such as \"geopolitical tensions,\" \"interest rate hikes,\" \"digitalization,\" and \"regulatory framework\" are well translated.\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" consistently, which is appropriate for a formal context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"escalating geopolitical tensions\" while others use \"escalation of geopolitical tensions.\" While both are acceptable, \"escalating\" is more commonly used in formal writing.\n- **\"Risks and opportunities\" vs. \"threats and opportunities\":** The original uses \"既有危又有機,\" which is more neutral and balanced. \"Threats\" may carry a more negative connotation than \"risks.\"\n- **\"Continuous regulatory efforts\" vs. \"ongoing supervision\" or \"continuous regulatory efforts\":** \"Continuous regulatory efforts\" is more precise and aligns better with the original's emphasis on sustained regulatory work.\n- **\"Referring to international standards\" vs. \"by referencing international standards\":** The former is more natural and commonly used in formal writing.\n- **\"Monetary Authority\" vs. \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\":** The original refers to \"金管局,\" which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or the acronym \"HKMA\" is more precise and avoids ambiguity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent and formal language that aligns with the tone of regulatory and financial documents.\n- Choose vocabulary that is precise and neutral, avoiding overly negative terms like \"threats.\"\n- Ensure that acronyms like \"HKMA\" are introduced properly and used consistently.\n- Maintain parallel structure and clarity in sentence construction to enhance readability and professionalism.\n---\nGiven the escalating geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both risks and opportunities for the banking industry. In response to the rapidly changing financial landscape, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks through continuous regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize its banking regulatory framework and policies by referring to international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, with a focus on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers in weaker financial positions. The HKMA will also strengthen its supervisory systems and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme, while ensuring that customers temporarily facing difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn reviewing the translations provided, several observations can be made regarding their quality and accuracy. All translations capture the core meaning of the original sentence, which is that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strengthen its oversight of liquidity and market risk management for authorized institutions in 2023, in response to an uncertain macroeconomic environment.\nStrengths across the translations include the correct identification of the HKMA as the subject, the accurate use of terms such as \"liquidity\" and \"market risk management,\" and the appropriate temporal reference to 2023. However, there are notable differences in phrasing and nuance that affect fluency and precision.\nThe first translation uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is incorrect; the correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This is a critical error in terminology. The second and third translations correctly identify the HKMA but use \"authorized institutions\" instead of \"licensed financial institutions,\" which is a minor but important distinction in regulatory terminology. The fourth translation omits the verb \"strengthen\" and instead says \"strengthen the liquidity and market risk management,\" which changes the meaning by implying that the liquidity and risk management themselves are being strengthened, rather than the supervision of them. The fifth translation uses \"regulation\" instead of \"supervision,\" which is a subtle but meaningful difference in regulatory context. The sixth translation is the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure, using \"oversight\" and \"authorized institutions,\" and it includes the preposition \"of\" correctly.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is essential to use the correct name of the institution (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), the correct term for the institutions being supervised (licensed financial institutions), and the appropriate verb to describe the action (strengthen the supervision of). Additionally, the preposition \"of\" should be used to clarify that the supervision is of the liquidity and market risk management, not that the liquidity and risk management are being strengthened directly.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nIn addition, in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strengthen its supervision of the liquidity and market risk management of licensed financial institutions in 2023.\n\n# Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in developing their operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cybersecurity capabilities by following up on issues identified in the \"Cybersecurity Assessment Framework 2.0\" and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup measures.\n\nAs the pace of digitalization accelerates, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's other regulatory priorities include strengthening oversight of banks' risk management related to third-party service providers, as well as enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will prioritize updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) ecosystem to address AML\/CTF risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology (RegTech) and compliance technology. The HKMA will also revise its \"Guidelines on Countering Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,\" issuing specific guidance on implementing risk-proportionate measures for \"politically exposed persons,\" thereby facilitating the industry's effective and risk-based implementation of key legislative amendments. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of its existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of an inter-bank information-sharing platform, aiming to expedite the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account misuse, and strengthen protection and assistance for victims of fraud in recovering their losses. The HKMA will also further promote the adoption of compliance technology, including data analytics, through the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory\" and other AML compliance technology initiatives, and strive to develop macro-level analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. By implementing these measures, the HKMA will be better equipped to swiftly respond to systemic money laundering risks such as puppet account networks and flexibly address evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Consistency**: \n   - The term \"authorized institutions\" is used in most translations, which is appropriate. However, \"licensed corporations\" (used in Translation 2) is less common in regulatory contexts in Hong Kong, where \"authorized institutions\" is the standard term.\n   - \"Non-site monitoring\" (Translation 5) is an incorrect term; the correct term is \"off-site monitoring.\"\n   - \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" (Translation 5) is a misrendering of the official name, which should be \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect.\"\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - Translation 1 and 6 are the most fluent, with natural sentence structures and appropriate use of prepositions and articles.\n   - Translation 5 has a slightly awkward structure with \"throughout this process\" and \"refer to the latest market developments and revisions to international standards,\" which is slightly less fluid than \"take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\"\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**:\n   - All translations correctly use \"Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" and \"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\" with proper capitalization and acronyms.\n   - The use of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" with the full name and acronym is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for formal contexts.\n4. **Word Choice and Nuance**:\n   - \"Enhance\" (Translation 1 and 6) and \"strengthen\" (Translations 2, 3, 4) are both acceptable, but \"enhance\" may be slightly more precise in the context of regulatory oversight.\n   - \"Intensify\" (Translation 4) is also acceptable but slightly more forceful than necessary.\n   - \"Take into account\" (Translations 1, 4, 6) is more natural than \"refer to\" (Translations 2, 3, 5) in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and fluency of Translation 1 or 6, while incorporating the most accurate terminology and stylistic choices. It should use \"authorized institutions,\" \"off-site monitoring,\" and the correct name \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect.\" It should also use \"take into account\" for a more natural tone.\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will enhance on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management, as well as the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. The key focus areas in 2023 will include the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. Throughout the process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, terminology, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reflect its role in maintaining communication with regulatory bodies and the banking sector.\n- The phrase \"provide guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and MPF products\" is consistently translated, with only minor variations in the use of \"MPF\" (Mandatory Provident Fund) and \"mandatory provident fund.\"\n- The inclusion of \"guidance on providing virtual asset-related investment services\" is well handled across all translations.\n- The second part of the text, regarding the HKMA's participation in international organizations and collaboration with the government and regulators, is also consistently translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"maintain close communication\" versus \"maintain close contact\" or \"closely coordinate\" introduces slight variations in tone and formality. \"Maintain close communication\" is more formal and appropriate for official statements.\n- The phrase \"which will also include guidance on providing virtual asset-related investment services\" is slightly awkward in some translations. A smoother phrasing such as \"including guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets\" is more natural.\n- The use of \"develop a comprehensive virtual asset regulatory framework\" versus \"establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets\" introduces slight differences in verb choice. \"Establish\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts than \"develop.\"\n- The phrase \"to this end\" is used in one translation, which is slightly less formal than \"in this regard\" or \"in this context,\" which are more commonly used in official statements.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"maintain close communication\" for consistency and formality.\n- Use \"including guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Use \"establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets\" for clarity and consistency with regulatory terminology.\n- Ensure that \"MPF\" is consistently used as an acronym, with the full form \"Mandatory Provident Fund\" introduced on first mention.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will also maintain close communication with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, and provide guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products, including guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will coordinate with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including those applicable to sophisticated investors), and will begin regulating the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with the new units and operational guidelines in the relevant \"Regulatory Policy Manual.\"\n\n# Monitor financial market infrastructure.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to formal, professional English used in regulatory and financial contexts. Below is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reference the key legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g., the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, and the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee).\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology related to financial regulation and international standards.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main ideas are preserved.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** Some translations use slightly different names for the same entity (e.g., \"Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee\" vs. \"Payment and Settlement Systems Board\").\n- **Fluency and Readability:** Some translations are slightly awkward or repetitive, such as the use of \"as needed\" or \"where necessary\" multiple times.\n- **Precision in References:** Some translations incorrectly refer to the \"Financial Infrastructure Committee\" or \"Payment and Settlement Systems Board\" instead of the correct \"Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee.\"\n- **Cultural and Regulatory Appropriateness:** The tone should be formal and precise, as this is a regulatory document. Some translations could be more concise and professional.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the exact and official names of the regulatory bodies and legal instruments to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n- Maintain a consistent and formal tone throughout the translation.\n- Avoid redundancy by varying expressions such as \"as needed\" and \"where necessary.\"\n- Ensure that the translation flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning and intent.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructures under its supervision in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (Infrastructure Principles), and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. Where necessary, the HKMA will assess these infrastructures in light of the latest international standards. It will participate in the monitoring and evaluation programs conducted by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) regarding the implementation of the Infrastructure Principles. The HKMA will also engage in the work of international standard-setting organizations and enhance its own supervisory requirements in line with international practices or in response to market and technological developments. Additionally, where necessary, the HKMA will collaborate with relevant authorities to further strengthen collaborative supervisory arrangements.\n\n# Formulating Policy\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continuing to enhance its banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices. The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with slight variations in terminology and phrasing.\nTranslation 1 uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in formal contexts but may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the term. It also uses \"strengthen and improve,\" which is slightly redundant.\nTranslation 2 uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"optimize\" instead of \"improve.\" This is more precise and professional. However, it still uses \"in accordance with,\" which is slightly more formal than necessary.\nTranslation 3 is similar to Translation 2 but adds \"its\" before \"banking regulatory framework and policies,\" which is grammatically correct and adds clarity by specifying that the framework and policies belong to the HKMA.\nTranslation 4 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a factual error and should be corrected.\nTranslation 5 uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could be ambiguous, especially in a global context.\nTranslation 6 uses \"refine\" instead of \"optimize\" or \"improve,\" which is a more precise term in the context of regulatory frameworks. However, \"refine\" may not be as commonly used in this context as \"optimize.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity, include the possessive \"its\" to specify that the framework and policies belong to the HKMA, and use \"optimize\" or \"refine\" as more precise terms than \"improve.\" Additionally, \"in line with\" is more natural and commonly used in formal English than \"in accordance with.\"\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and optimize its banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing the Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standards\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to formal regulatory language. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Translation**: This version is fluent and accurate, with a clear structure. However, it uses \"negative vetting procedure,\" which is not a standard term in legislative processes. It should be \"pre-legislative scrutiny\" or \"prior scrutiny.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This is very close to the original in structure and terminology. It uses \"neutral countercyclical capital buffer,\" which is slightly awkward. The term \"countercyclical capital buffer\" is standard, and \"neutral\" may be redundant or misinterpreted.\n3. **Third Translation**: This is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework,\" which is a good clarification. However, it omits the term \"final\" in \"final reforms,\" which is important for clarity.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is very precise and uses \"pre-legislative consultation process,\" which is accurate. It also includes \"countercyclical capital buffer with a neutral stance,\" which is slightly wordy but not incorrect.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"Basel Bank for International Settlements,\" which is incorrect. The correct term is \"Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\" It also uses \"output floor,\" which is a correct term in regulatory contexts.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This is very similar to the second and fourth translations. It uses \"countercyclical buffer capital with a neutral stance,\" which is slightly awkward. It also uses \"pre-legislative consultation process,\" which is accurate.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, use standard regulatory terminology, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also be consistent in terminology and avoid redundancy or awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the best version would combine the strengths of the translations while correcting the minor inaccuracies and awkward phrasings.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize its capital framework by implementing the standards issued in recent years by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), including:\n- The revised capital standards set out in the \"Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms\" published in December 2017, the \"Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk\" issued in January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the \"Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework\" issued in July 2020. These revised capital standards, collectively referred to as the \"Final Reforms of Basel III,\" outline new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduce floor requirements as well as an optimized leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on proposed amendments to the \"Banking (Capital) Rules\" (\"Capital Rules\") in 2023 to implement the aforementioned requirements and the countercyclical capital buffer. The proposed amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny in the same year and will not take effect before January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.\n- The \"Prudential Treatment of Risks from Crypto-Assets\" issued in December 2022. The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally by January 1, 2025, in line with the Basel Committee's timeline, and intends to consult the industry on the related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Tolerance Limit\n\nIn March 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the Banking (Limitation on Risk Exposure) Rules. These proposed amendments were primarily introduced in response to the implementation of the revised capital standards under the final reforms of Basel III mentioned above. The consultation document also included other corresponding amendments regarding the handling of concentration risk related to official entities under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component under the revised Capital Rules for the final reforms of Basel III (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the intent to consult the industry in 2023.\n- The terminology related to the rules (e.g., \"Banking (Liquidity) Rules,\" \"Capital Rules,\" \"Basel III\") is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The key point about the alignment of the implementation dates with Basel III reforms is preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"made in response to the proposed amendments to the Capital Rules at the same time\" (Translation 1), which is less fluid than alternatives like \"in response to concurrent proposed revisions\" (Translation 3).\n- **Precision:** The phrase \"the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the final reforms of Basel III\" (Translation 1) is slightly less precise than \"the credit risk component in the revised Capital Rules implementing the final Basel III reforms\" (Translation 5), which better reflects the relationship between the rules and the reforms.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"amendments\" while others use \"revisions\" or \"proposed revisions,\" which, while not incorrect, may affect consistency.\n- **Clarity of Reference:** The use of \"the '2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules'\" is consistent across translations, but the placement of the quotation marks and the use of \"the\" before the rule name vary slightly, which could be standardized for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be considered:\n- Use a consistent and natural phrasing, such as \"in response to concurrent proposed amendments\" to enhance fluency.\n- Ensure that the relationship between the rules and Basel III reforms is clearly and precisely conveyed, using terms like \"implementing the final Basel III reforms.\"\n- Maintain consistency in terminology, using \"amendments\" or \"revisions\" consistently throughout the text.\n- Ensure that the structure of the sentence is clear and that the alignment of the implementation dates is unambiguous.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from the junior translations, with adjustments for fluency, precision, and consistency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (the \"2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules\"). These amendments are made in response to concurrent proposed amendments to the Capital Rules, and therefore, the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component in the revised Capital Rules implementing the final Basel III reforms (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Accuracy**: \n   - The term \"Third Pillar 1\" appears in some translations (e.g., Translation 1 and 5), but the original text simply refers to \"第三支柱1 披露規定\" as \"Third Pillar 1 Disclosure Requirements.\" This may be a misinterpretation or a formatting error. The correct term is likely \"Third Pillar Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" as used in Translation 4 and 6.\n   - The term \"window dressing\" is correctly used in all translations, but the explanation varies slightly. Some translations use \"referring to\" while others use \"i.e.,\", which affects clarity and formality.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - Translation 1 is the most fluent and grammatically sound, with clear sentence structure and appropriate use of terms like \"legislation first, scrutiny later\" procedure.\n   - Translation 2 has a minor error in referring to \"Pillar 1\" instead of \"Third Pillar,\" which is a critical mistake given the context of Basel III.\n   - Translation 3 and 4 are also fluent, but some phrases are slightly wordy or repetitive.\n   - Translation 5 uses \"pre-enactment and post-enactment review procedure,\" which is not standard terminology and may confuse readers.\n   - Translation 6 is very close to the best version, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and consistency.\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**:\n   - All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" and \"Legislative Council,\" which are appropriate for the Hong Kong context.\n   - The term \"pre-legislative scrutiny\" is more commonly used in official contexts than \"legislation first, scrutiny later\" or \"pre-enactment and post-enactment review procedure.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards in the final reform package of Basel III are primarily set out in the Basel Committee's \"Third Pillar Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" issued in December 2018, and the \"Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements,\" issued in November 2021. In June 2019, the Basel Committee also issued the \"Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements,\" revising the disclosure rules on the leverage ratio to address concerns about potential \"window dressing\" (i.e., banks reducing the volume of certain transactions before or after the reporting date in order to artificially increase the reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratio). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also preparing corresponding amendments to the \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules\" (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is seeking industry feedback throughout the process. It is expected that the amendments to the Disclosure Rules will be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny together with the amendments to the Capital Rules in 2023.\n"}

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and fluent. It uses \"institutional governance\" consistently and correctly. However, \"uphold a high level of institutional governance\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"uphold high standards of institutional governance.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the addition of \"the HKMA’s fulfillment of its statutory functions.\" This is slightly more precise than \"its ability to fulfill its statutory responsibilities,\" but the difference is minimal. The phrase \"a high standard of institutional governance\" is more natural than \"a high level.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and uses \"sound governance\" instead of \"good governance,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still acceptable. The phrase \"uphold high standards of institutional governance\" is more idiomatic than \"uphold a high level of institutional governance.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses \"de facto central banking institution,\" which is not necessary unless the text is emphasizing the HKMA's unofficial or informal role, which it is not. The phrase \"the highest standards of institutional governance\" is slightly more emphatic than needed, but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"preserving the public's trust and confidence,\" which is slightly more formal than \"maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence,\" but still accurate. The phrase \"a high standard of institutional governance\" is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the fifth, but it uses \"the Authority's statutory duties\" instead of \"its fulfillment of statutory duties.\" This is slightly less precise, as it omits the action of fulfilling the duties.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, precise, and idiomatic. It should use \"good governance\" as in the original, avoid unnecessary terms like \"de facto,\" and use \"uphold high standards of institutional governance\" as it is the most natural and commonly used phrase in this context. It should also maintain the structure of the original sentence, which emphasizes the HKMA's understanding and its commitment.\n**Improved Translation**:\nAs Hong Kong's central banking institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfillment of statutory duties. Therefore, it has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to good institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:  \n- Has established a clear and highly accountable institutional governance framework;  \n- Has implemented comprehensive and robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure that the behavior of all staff and their daily operations meet specified standards; and  \n- Adheres to a policy of transparency and openness, maintaining close communication with all stakeholders.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government).\n- The concept of employing staff under different terms from civil servants is consistently captured.\n- The role of the HKMA's Chief Executive and staff as public officials is accurately reflected.\n- The idea of high autonomy in daily operations within the scope of statutory powers is well conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Secretary\" while others use \"Commissioner for Financial Management\" or \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\" The correct term in the context of Hong Kong governance is \"Financial Secretary,\" as this is the official title of the official responsible for financial matters.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use phrases like \"terms of service\" or \"terms of appointment,\" which are less common in official English documents. \"Terms of employment\" is more standard in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are slightly wordy, such as \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government),\" which can be simplified to \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government).\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"public officials\" is acceptable, but \"public officers\" is more commonly used in official Hong Kong English contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the correct and official title \"Financial Secretary\" for the relevant official.\n- Use consistent and standard terminology such as \"terms of employment.\"\n- Ensure the translation is concise and avoids redundancy.\n- Use \"public officers\" as it is more aligned with Hong Kong's official English usage.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government), but it can employ staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA's Chief Executive and its staff are all public officers. The HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations within the statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is autonomously responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including deciding on relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Financial Secretary as the main figure responsible for maintaining Hong Kong’s financial stability and international status.\n- The key duties of the Financial Management Officer (or equivalent title) are accurately listed in all translations.\n- The structure of the original text is preserved in all translations, with bullet points used appropriately.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in word choice.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Title Inconsistency:** The title of the official assisting the Financial Secretary varies across translations (e.g., \"Director of the Financial Secretary's Department,\" \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" \"Financial Controller,\" \"Commissioner for Financial Management\"). The correct title in Hong Kong is \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"\n- **Terminology Variance:** Some translations use \"Financial Controller\" or \"Commissioner for Financial Management,\" which are not the standard titles used in Hong Kong. The correct title is \"Financial Management Officer\" or \"Commissioner of the Financial Management Department.\"\n- **Minor Stylistic Issues:** Some translations use \"developing the debt market\" or \"developing the payment, settlement, and clearing systems,\" which are acceptable but could be more precise. For example, \"developing the debt market\" could be \"developing debt markets\" for grammatical consistency.\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"help strengthen\" or \"assist in strengthening,\" which are slightly less direct than \"strengthen.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the correct and official title: \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"\n- Use the correct title for the official whose duties are outlined: \"Commissioner of the Financial Management Department\" or \"Financial Management Officer.\"\n- Ensure grammatical consistency (e.g., \"developing debt markets\" instead of \"developing the debt market\").\n- Use precise and direct language (e.g., \"strengthen\" instead of \"help strengthen\").\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone consistent with official government documents.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Commissioner of the Financial Management Department include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop debt markets;\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating such systems where appropriate; and\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe original text outlines the authority structure regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, emphasizing the Financial Secretary's control and the role of the Financial Management Officer in executing this control. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but uses \"Financial Controller\" which may not be the most accurate term for the role described. It also uses \"act under the authority delegated\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently and \"Financial Management Specialist\" which is a bit vague. The structure is good, but the term \"Financial Management Specialist\" may not be the official title.\n**Translation 3** uses \"vested in\" which is a strong and accurate legal term. \"Financial Management Officer\" is more precise than \"Specialist.\" The phrase \"in accordance with the powers delegated\" is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 4** introduces \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the correct title for the role described in the original text. This could be a misinterpretation of the role.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"deployment and investment management,\" which are more precise. However, the title may still be incorrect for the role described.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"use and investment management,\" which are accurate. The phrase \"based on the powers delegated\" is slightly less formal than \"in accordance with the powers delegated.\"\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Use \"Financial Management Officer\" as it is more precise than \"Specialist\" or \"Controller.\"\n- Use \"vested in\" or \"under the control of\" for the first sentence.\n- Use \"in accordance with the powers delegated\" for a more formal and legal tone.\n- Ensure the title of the officer is accurate and consistent with official terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) autonomy in its daily operations and policy implementation, while also highlighting its accountability and transparency. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, word choice, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and convey the key concepts of autonomy, accountability, and transparency.\n- The use of \"consistently maintained\" or \"has always maintained\" effectively reflects the original's emphasis on continuity.\n- The structure \"while also ensuring\" or \"coupled with\" is appropriate for showing the balance between autonomy and accountability.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The sixth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a factual error.\n- Some translations use \"pursuing government policy goals\" or \"methods used in daily operations,\" which are slightly less precise than \"day-to-day operations\" or \"methods used for daily operations.\"\n- The phrase \"being supported by high accountability and transparency\" in the fourth translation is less direct than \"coupled with\" or \"accompanied by.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently for clarity.\n- Use \"day-to-day operations\" for precision.\n- Use \"coupled with\" or \"accompanied by\" to show the relationship between autonomy and accountability\/transparency.\n- Ensure grammatical consistency and natural flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods used to implement government policy objectives, coupled with strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe original text outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) key functions and objectives, emphasizing stability, reserve management, financial infrastructure, and economic development. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice, prepositions, and phrasing that affect the overall tone and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA's role and its goals.\n- The use of \"developing and supervising\/monitoring\/overseeing\" a \"sound\/robust\/diversified financial infrastructure\" is consistent and accurate.\n- The phrase \"consolidating Hong Kong's status\/position as an international financial center\" is well-rendered across translations.\n- The final goal of \"promoting economic development\" is clearly conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"currency and banking system\" instead of \"monetary and banking systems,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- The second and sixth translators use \"monetary and banking systems\" and \"position\" respectively, which are more idiomatic in English.\n- The fifth translator uses \"maintaining monetary and banking stability\" instead of \"promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems,\" which is a slight deviation from the original but still accurate.\n- The use of \"driving\" in translations 3 and 4 is more dynamic than \"promoting,\" which may be more appropriate depending on the desired tone.\n- The term \"financial centre\" in translation 5 uses British English spelling, which may be inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain accuracy, fluency, and consistency with standard English usage. The phrase \"monetary and banking systems\" is more idiomatic than \"currency and banking system.\" The verb \"promoting\" is more aligned with the original Chinese than \"driving,\" which may imply a more forceful or aggressive tone. The term \"status\" is slightly more formal than \"position,\" but both are acceptable. The use of \"sound and diversified\" is appropriate, though \"robust and diversified\" may be slightly more dynamic. The phrase \"promoting economic development\" is more standard than \"promoting the development of Hong Kong's economy.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and supervising a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and promoting economic development.\n\nTo effectively perform its duties, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must gain the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and operations to the public, and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its scope of responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA timely clarifies false information and rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media channels.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to formal, professional English. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA's accountability through the Financial Secretary and the Legislative Council.\n- The concept of promoting public understanding and monitoring public concerns is consistently captured.\n- The policy objectives are generally well-articulated, with most translations using appropriate terminology such as \"transparency,\" \"open policy,\" and \"public sentiment.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Management Officer\" or \"Financial Management Specialist,\" which are not standard terms for the role described. The correct term is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n- **Structural Issues:** A few translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"To the greatest extent possible, ensuring...\" which is grammatically incorrect. Others use \"To the extent possible, to ensure...\" which is more natural but still slightly awkward.\n- **Cultural and Institutional Nuance:** Some translations fail to clearly distinguish between the roles of the Financial Secretary and the Legislative Council in terms of accountability, which is a key point in the original text.\n- **Fluency and Style:** While all translations are generally fluent, some use overly wordy or repetitive phrasing, such as \"maintaining extensive engagement with society\" or \"maintaining an open policy.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the correct title: \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer\" or \"Specialist.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing, such as using \"to ensure that\" rather than \"To the extent possible, to ensure that.\"\n- Clarify the dual accountability of the HKMA through the Financial Secretary and the Legislative Council.\n- Maintain a formal, professional tone consistent with official documents.\n- Ensure that the policy objectives are clearly and concisely stated, with attention to legal and institutional nuances.\nBased on this review, here is the improved translation:\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA is committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, while respecting legal restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data; and\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its commitment to transparency.\n- The mention of bilingual publications, the website, and the use of social media are consistently translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, and the key details (e.g., the information center, the website, and the reference to the chapter on functions) are preserved.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary and Terminology:** Some translations use \"periodicals\" or \"journals\" interchangeably, but \"journals\" may not be the most precise term for official publications. \"Publications\" or \"special publications\" are more neutral and appropriate.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use phrases like \"maintaining extensive contact with the media\" or \"maintaining extensive communication with the media.\" The latter is more natural and commonly used in formal writing.\n- **Consistency in Nomenclature:** The term \"HKMA\" is used inconsistently across translations. Some use \"the Authority\" or \"the HKMA\" interchangeably, which may confuse readers. It is better to maintain a consistent reference, such as \"the HKMA\" or \"the Authority\" throughout.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Functions of the Authority\" is used in some translations, while others use \"Institutional Functions.\" The original text uses \"機構職能,\" which is best translated as \"Functions of the Authority\" or \"Institutional Functions,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"Functions of the Authority\" is more direct and commonly used in official contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"publications\" or \"special publications\" instead of \"journals\" or \"periodicals\" for official documents.\n- Maintain consistent use of \"the HKMA\" or \"the Authority\" throughout the translation.\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"maintaining extensive communication with the media\" instead of \"maintaining extensive contact with the media.\"\n- Ensure that the reference to the chapter is consistent and clear, using \"Functions of the Authority\" or \"Institutional Functions\" as appropriate.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive communication with the media, it publishes a variety of bilingual (Chinese and English) publications and special reports. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a wealth of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an Information Centre, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week. Details regarding the HKMA’s work in communication and engagement with the public can be found in the chapter \"Functions of the Authority\" (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Exchange Fund, and the Currency Board as key entities.\n- The mention of the 1999 participation in the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) is consistently accurate.\n- The inclusion of the 1996 date for the HKMA website featuring banking policies is present in all translations.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"meeting minutes\" and \"operational reports.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Currency Board\" while others use \"Currency Issuing Department\" or \"Note Issuing Office.\" The original text uses \"貨幣發行局\" which is best translated as \"Currency Issuing Department\" or \"Note Issuing Office.\" However, \"Currency Board\" is a term more commonly used in the context of monetary policy and may not be the most accurate in this context.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"disclosing information regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board\" or \"the frequency and detail of its disclosure of information.\" These can be more naturally phrased.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" is more commonly referred to as \"Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)\" in official contexts, and it is important to use the full name on first mention.\n- **Clarity of Structure:** Some translations are slightly convoluted, such as \"the Currency Board, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which can be simplified.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use consistent and accurate terminology, such as \"Currency Issuing Department\" or \"Note Issuing Office\" for \"貨幣發行局.\"\n- Ensure that the full name of the IMF's program is used on first mention, followed by the acronym in parentheses.\n- Improve fluency by using more natural phrasing, such as \"increasing the frequency and detail of its disclosures\" instead of \"progressively increasing the frequency and detail of its disclosure.\"\n- Ensure clarity in the structure of sentences, particularly when describing the relationship between the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Currency Issuing Department.\nBased on this review and reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has gradually increased the frequency and detail of its disclosures regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuing Department. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. It also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuing Department Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Issuing Department system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe original text discusses the importance of the relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council (LegCo) in promoting accountability and transparency. It also outlines the HKMA's commitment to regular briefings and participation in legislative meetings.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"Financial Affairs Committee\" and \"sub-committees.\" However, the phrase \"各项工作\" is translated as \"various works,\" which is awkward. It should be \"various operations\" or \"various work.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which may be more accurate depending on the official title. The use of \"regularly\" instead of \"occasionally\" is more consistent with the original meaning.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"LegCo\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in formal contexts. The use of \"operations\" instead of \"work\" is more natural in this context.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very accurate and uses \"various operations\" effectively. The use of \"frequently\" instead of \"occasionally\" is more in line with the original meaning. However, \"Standing Committees and Sub-Committees\" should be hyphenated consistently.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation has a minor error in referring to the \"House Committee on Financial Affairs,\" which is not the correct name of the committee. It should be \"Financial Affairs Committee.\" Also, \"select committees\" is not the standard term used in the Legislative Council.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"operations\" and \"address related inquiries\" effectively. The use of \"elaborate on and discuss specific issues\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but still acceptable. The term \"support legislators\" is slightly less precise than \"assist legislators.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct terminology. It should reflect the formal tone of the original text while ensuring clarity and natural English expression. The use of \"Governor\" or \"Chief Executive\" depends on the official title of the HKMA head, which should be verified. The term \"Financial Affairs Committee\" is more precise than \"House Committee on Financial Affairs.\" The use of \"operations\" is more natural than \"work\" in this context. The frequency of attendance should be consistent with the original, using \"regularly\" or \"occasionally\" as appropriate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA's operations and policies three times a year and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives regularly attend meetings of the Legislative Council's committees and subcommittees to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Monitoring Measures\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) use of internal and external monitoring mechanisms to uphold high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. It also highlights the role of internal and external audit functions in independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"ensure high standards of employee conduct,\" which is appropriate. However, \"sufficient and effective\" is slightly redundant; \"adequate and effective\" is more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. The phrase \"ensure the maintenance of high standards\" is slightly more verbose than necessary, but still correct. The use of \"adequacy and effectiveness\" is better than \"sufficient and effective.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error. It also uses \"integrity\" instead of \"conduct,\" which is slightly different in nuance.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"sound\" instead of \"robust,\" which is a minor stylistic choice. The phrase \"provide independent assessments on whether the monitoring mechanisms are adequate and effective\" is slightly less direct than \"provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"staff integrity\" instead of \"employee conduct,\" which is a slight variation in terminology but still acceptable. The phrase \"both internal and external audit functions\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"adherence to high standards of employee conduct,\" which is slightly more formal than necessary but still appropriate. The phrase \"provide an independent assessment of whether the monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and effective\" is slightly less direct than \"provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, concise, and natural in English. It should use the correct name for the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA\"), use appropriate terminology (\"employee conduct\" or \"integrity\"), and avoid redundancy. The phrase \"adequacy and effectiveness\" is more concise and natural than \"sufficient and effective.\" Also, the use of \"ensure\" is more direct than \"ensure the maintenance of.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe original Chinese sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing the role of the Code of Conduct in guiding employees' ethical and legal behavior across all levels of the organization. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, grammar, and fluency that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"staff members at every level\" and \"conforms to established standards.\" However, \"conforms to\" is slightly less common in formal corporate contexts than \"complies with\" or \"aligns with.\"\n**Translation 2** is also accurate, but \"meet the specified standards in their conduct\" is slightly awkward. The phrase \"in their conduct\" is redundant since \"conduct\" is already implied in \"meet the specified standards.\"\n**Translation 3** is very close to the ideal, using \"aligns with established standards,\" which is a natural and formal expression. However, \"employees at every level\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"employees at all levels.\"\n**Translation 4** is concise and clear, but \"the behavior of all staff members meets specified standards\" lacks the nuance of \"ensuring that all levels of staff\" and omits the emphasis on \"every level.\"\n**Translation 5** has a grammatical issue: \"the behavior of all levels of staff\" is incorrect. \"Levels of staff\" is not a standard phrase; it should be \"all employees at all levels.\"\n**Translation 6** is the most accurate and natural, using \"complies with the specified standards,\" which is a formal and commonly used expression in corporate and legal contexts. It also uses \"employees at every level,\" which is slightly more formal than \"at all levels,\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use formal, corporate-appropriate language. It should accurately reflect the original meaning, which is that the Code of Conduct ensures that all employees, regardless of their level, behave in accordance with specified standards. The phrase \"complies with the specified standards\" is the most natural and formal choice. \"Employees at all levels\" is more idiomatic than \"at every level.\" Therefore, the best translation would combine the clarity of Translation 6 with the slight refinement of \"at all levels.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees at all levels complies with the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 內部監控,\" which translates to \"Internal Monitoring\" in English. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, though there are a few notable variations. The first, second, fourth, and sixth translators used \"# Internal Monitoring\" or \"Internal monitoring,\" which are both acceptable, though the use of the hashtag (#) may be context-dependent. The third translator omitted the hashtag entirely, which could be appropriate depending on the formatting requirements. The fifth translator used \"Internal Controls,\" which is a related but distinct term. \"Controls\" typically refers to procedures or mechanisms designed to ensure compliance, whereas \"Monitoring\" refers more to the act of observing or checking. Given the context of the original term, \"Internal Monitoring\" is the most accurate and natural translation. The best translation should be concise, accurate, and contextually appropriate, which \"Internal Monitoring\" achieves.\n\n# Operational Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks in their work processes and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth and stable daily operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the responsibilities of the Risk Committee. It outlines the committee's role in reviewing and discussing risks identified by various departments, evaluating the adequacy of monitoring and mitigation strategies, and determining follow-up actions.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, the phrase \"the adequacy of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies\" is slightly less direct than the original, which uses \"是否充足\" (whether adequate). This translation is acceptable but lacks the nuance of a question or evaluation.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the first, with the same minor issue regarding the phrasing of \"the adequacy of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies.\" It is fluent and accurate but could be more precise in reflecting the evaluative nature of the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version improves on the previous ones by using \"whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate,\" which more accurately reflects the original's \"是否充足.\" This is a stronger translation in terms of capturing the evaluative aspect of the sentence.\n4. **Fourth and fifth junior translators:** These translations are identical to the third and are also strong in capturing the evaluative nature of the original sentence.\n5. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the most accurate and natural. It uses \"assesses whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate,\" which closely mirrors the original's structure and intent. The use of \"assesses\" is more precise than \"reviews and discusses\" in the context of evaluating adequacy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should reflect the formal tone of the original, accurately convey the evaluative nature of the Risk Committee's role, and use natural, fluent English. The sixth translation achieves this by using \"assesses whether\" to reflect the evaluation of adequacy, which is more precise than \"reviews and discusses\" in this context. It also maintains the structure and clarity of the original sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, assesses whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is simply the heading \"# 內部審計,\" which translates directly to \"# Internal Audit.\" All junior translators have correctly translated the term \"內部審計\" as \"Internal Audit,\" which is the standard and accurate translation in both professional and academic contexts. However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Consistency in Formatting:** The original text includes a hashtag (#) before the term. While this may be a formatting choice (e.g., for headings in digital documents or social media), it is not standard in formal or professional English documents. The junior translators have either replicated the hashtag or omitted it. The fourth junior translator included the hashtag, while the others did not. This is a minor but notable difference.\n2. **Fluency and Professionalism:** \"Internal Audit\" is a standard term in English and is widely understood in business and accounting contexts. It is grammatically correct and culturally appropriate. There is no need for further elaboration or rephrasing in this case, as the term is concise and precise.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Internal Audit\" is universally recognized in English-speaking professional environments, so there is no cultural misalignment.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:** While all translations are technically correct, the inclusion of the hashtag (#) may be unnecessary in a formal context. However, if the original formatting is to be preserved for stylistic or structural reasons (e.g., in a document with numbered sections or headings), it should be retained. Otherwise, it is better to omit it for clarity and professionalism.\n**Best Possible Translation:** Given the context and the goal of producing a fluent, natural English translation, the most appropriate version would be \"Internal Audit\" without the hashtag, as it aligns with standard professional English usage. If the hashtag is to be retained for formatting purposes, then \"# Internal Audit\" would be acceptable. However, in most formal contexts, the hashtag is unnecessary.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement describing the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Internal Audit Department. The junior translators have produced several versions that are largely accurate but vary in terms of terminology, fluency, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject as the Internal Audit Department of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- The core meaning—assessing governance, risk management, and monitoring measures—is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of \"adequate and effective\" or \"sufficient and effective\" is appropriate, though \"adequate\" may be slightly more formal and precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"provides recommendations for improvement\" is natural and commonly used in formal English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The fourth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error.\n- The first and sixth translations use \"sufficient and effective,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"adequate and effective.\"\n- The third and fifth translations use \"procedures\" instead of \"processes,\" which is a minor but notable difference in terminology. \"Procedures\" may imply more structured, step-by-step actions, while \"processes\" are broader and more commonly used in governance contexts.\n- The second and third translations use \"different departments,\" while others use \"various departments\" or \"across different departments.\" All are acceptable, but \"across different departments\" is slightly more natural in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use the correct full name of the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"adequate and effective\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"processes\" to align with common governance terminology.\n- Use \"across different departments\" for natural phrasing.\n- Ensure the verb \"provides recommendations for improvement\" is used consistently and clearly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Internal Audit Department of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority independently assesses whether the governance processes, risk management, and monitoring measures across different departments are adequate and effective, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government.

The labor market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets were also under pressure. With the full resumption of travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong, the Hong Kong economy is forecast to experience a low-base recovery in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, weighed down by a variety of adverse factors both locally and externally (Table 1 and Figure 1). Domestically, the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in private consumption in the first quarter. Subsequently, private consumption saw a rebound with quarter-on-quarter growth, supported by the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus provided by the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Amid weak business sentiment and tighter financial conditions, overall investment expenditure fell significantly compared to 2021. Externally, Hong Kong’s goods exports declined as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Service exports remained generally weak, partly reflecting subdued inbound tourism, but improved somewhat in the fourth quarter following the government’s removal of mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: Detailed quarter-on-quarter changes in seasonally adjusted local fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the year-on-year core inflation rate gradually increased to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of high global energy and food prices partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, particularly soft housing rents (Figure 2). Additionally, weak economic activity led to subdued nominal wage growth and commercial property rents, which also helped to contain inflation. For the full year of 2022, the core and overall inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points: the unemployment rate peaking at 5.4% in April and declining to 3.5% by December, the recovery in employment and job vacancies, and the slight acceleration in wage growth.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the use of terms like \"labor market,\" \"unemployment rate,\" and \"labor force participation rate\" is appropriate.\n- Most translations use \"Figure 3\" correctly to reference the accompanying chart.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive or awkward phrasing, such as \"subsequently improved steadily\" or \"subsequently saw continuous improvement,\" which can be simplified for better flow.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The use of \"deteriorated rapidly\" is common, but \"deteriorated sharply\" or \"deteriorated significantly\" may be more natural in certain contexts.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"total employment numbers\" and \"total employment numbers remained below pre-pandemic levels.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The translations are technically sound, but they could be more concise and natural-sounding to align with standard English economic reporting.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more concise and natural phrasing, such as \"The labor market deteriorated sharply at the start of 2022 but gradually improved thereafter.\"\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"total employment\" consistently instead of repeating \"total employment numbers.\"\n- Use \"rebounded\" or \"rose\" for job vacancies, depending on the nuance intended.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"year-on-year\" is used consistently and appropriately.\n- Use \"slightly\" or \"mildly\" to describe the decline in labor force participation rate, depending on the tone desired.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most fluent and accurate elements from the junior translations, refined for clarity, conciseness, and natural English expression.\nThe labor market deteriorated sharply at the start of 2022 but gradually improved thereafter. The unemployment rate peaked at 5.4% in April before declining significantly to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates falling across most industries. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. Annual growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, the labor force decreased by 1.5% compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Estimates by staff of the Government Statistics Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Estimates by staff of the Government Statistics Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Estimates by staff of the Government Statistics Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple caption for a figure, consisting of the figure number, a title, and a source. The junior translators have mostly captured the essential elements, but there are variations in terminology and formatting that affect clarity and consistency.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Labor Market Conditions\" and \"Statistics Department.\" It is concise but omits \"Government,\" which may be important for clarity, especially if the department is part of the government structure.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Labor Market Conditions\" and includes \"Government Statistics Department,\" which is more precise and likely more accurate than just \"Statistics Department.\"\n- **Translation 3** combines the title and source without punctuation, which is less readable and not standard in formal captions.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Situation\" instead of \"Conditions,\" which is a minor but notable difference in nuance. \"Situation\" may imply a more temporary or current state, while \"Conditions\" is more general and commonly used in labor market contexts. It also includes \"Government Statistics Department,\" which is accurate.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Census and Statistics Department,\" which may be a specific department in a particular region (e.g., Hong Kong), but the original text only mentions \"政府統計處\" (Government Statistics Department), so this may be an over-specification.\n- **Translation 6** is similar to Translation 1 but includes \"Government,\" making it more precise.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Labor Market Conditions\" as it is the more standard term in this context. It should also include \"Government Statistics Department\" to accurately reflect the source. Proper punctuation (a colon after the figure number and a period after the title) enhances readability and adheres to standard caption formatting. Based on these considerations, the most accurate and fluent translation is:\n**Figure 3: Labor Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department**\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality and readability of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key events and figures, including the Hang Seng Index's performance, the reasons for the market correction, and the year-end decline.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"market correction,\" \"tightening global financial conditions,\" and \"pandemic prevention and control measures\" is appropriate and consistent with financial and geopolitical terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive phrasing, such as \"substantial correction\" or \"significant adjustment,\" which can be simplified or varied for better readability.\n- The phrase \"the market underwent a substantial correction\" is repeated in several translations, which may be redundant.\n- Some translations use \"the mainland's\" or \"mainland China's\" interchangeably, which is acceptable but could be more consistent.\n- The use of \"building on the downward trend\" or \"continuing the downward trend\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"following the downward trend\" or \"extending the downward trend.\"\n- The phrase \"the adjustment widened further\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity and fluency.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more varied and idiomatic expressions to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n- Ensure consistency in referring to \"mainland China\" or \"the mainland.\"\n- Use more natural phrasing for describing the market's response to external factors.\n- Ensure that the final sentence clearly conveys the significance of the 15.5% decline and the third consecutive year of decline.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would integrate the strengths of all versions while refining the language for fluency and clarity.\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Extending the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022—the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The market correction was initially triggered by heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 situation, U.S. interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Subsequently, tightening global financial conditions and the impact of the mainland's COVID-19 outbreak on the global economic outlook further widened the correction. In the final two months of the year, the stock market regained some upward momentum, partly supported by the mainland's optimized pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points by year-end, marking a significant 15.5% decline compared to the end of 2021, representing the third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical precision that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points: a 15% drop in house prices, a 39% drop in transaction volumes, and the interest rate range.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"tightened financial conditions,\" \"weakening economy,\" and \"mortgage repayment burden\" is appropriate and reflects the economic context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive or awkward phrasing, such as \"reaching a new low on record\" or \"a record low on record,\" which is redundant.\n- **Grammar and Syntax:** Minor grammatical issues appear, such as \"actual mortgage interest rate rose during the year from about 1.6% to 3.375 to 3.625%\" (missing the % symbol after 3.375).\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"housing prices\" instead of \"property prices,\" which is less standard in economic contexts. Also, \"rental income\" is less natural than \"rents\" or \"rental rates.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"deals\" in \"45,050 deals\" is not standard in property market reporting; \"transactions\" or \"sales\" is more appropriate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more standard economic terminology, such as \"property prices\" and \"rents.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of percentages and avoid redundancy.\n- Improve sentence flow by varying sentence structure and using more natural phrasing.\n- Ensure that the interest rate range is clearly expressed with proper punctuation and symbols.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from each version, ensuring clarity, fluency, and grammatical accuracy.\n---\nThe residential property market has come under pressure amid tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), with transaction volumes dropping sharply by 39% to 45,050, reaching a record low. Despite the decline in prices, affordability remains tight. Actual mortgage interest rates rose during the year from approximately 1.6% to between 3.375% and 3.625%, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for homebuyers. The non-residential property market has also softened further. With high vacancy rates, prices have declined, and rents remain weak.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between the mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to rebound from a low base in 2023. Although the anticipated slowdown in growth among advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong's merchandise exports, the recovery of the mainland economy and the removal of restrictions on cross-border land cargo transport should provide support for the local economy. The full resumption of cross-border travel between the mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit inbound tourism and other service exports, boosting local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government forecasts that real GDP will experience significant growth throughout 2023, ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%. However, the outlook for Hong Kong's economic growth remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and largely depends on the trajectory of U.S. Federal Reserve policy interest rates, the global growth outlook, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but it should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external price pressures are likely to remain high, the upward momentum may further weaken due to weaker economic activity in some major economies and easing upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, with the recovery of the local economy and improvements in the labor market, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but soft housing rental prices are expected to continue offsetting their impact to some extent. The government forecasts the overall and core inflation rates for the full year of 2023 to be 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to further improve as local economic activity normalizes.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, capturing the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in vocabulary, phrasing, and tone that affect the overall quality and naturalness of the English translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the main points: the challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, the resilience of Hong Kong banks, the increase in credit risk, the impact of rising interest rates on net interest income, and the overall improvement in retail banking profitability.\n- The use of terms like \"resilient,\" \"managed effectively,\" and \"maintaining ample capital and liquidity positions\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow, making the translations easy to read and understand.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Terminology:** Some translations use \"banking system\" while others use \"banking sector\" or \"banking industry.\" While all are acceptable, \"banking system\" is more precise in the context of Hong Kong's regulatory and financial framework.\n- **Phrasing and Nuance:** Some translations use \"handled them effectively\" or \"managed them effectively,\" which is slightly less formal than \"remained well-capitalized\" or \"remained resilient.\"\n- **Minor Grammar and Style Issues:** For example, \"in early year\" in the fifth translation is grammatically incorrect and should be \"in early 2022\" or \"at the beginning of the year.\"\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the banking system\" or \"banks’ net interest income,\" which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"banking system\" consistently to reflect the formal and institutional context.\n- Opt for more formal and precise terms such as \"remained resilient\" or \"remained well-capitalized\" to match the tone of the original text.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and avoid minor errors like \"in early year.\"\n- Streamline sentence structures to avoid redundancy and improve fluency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of the year, escalating geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major global central banks in response to rising inflation. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained resilient, with capital and liquidity positions continuing to be ample. Credit risk within the banking system increased during the year, but overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. At the same time, rising interest rates contributed to higher net interest income for banks, although this positive effect was partially offset by increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts and a decline in fee and commission income. Overall, retail banking profits improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, precision, and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the numerical data and the main points of the original text.\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent and follows a logical flow.\n- The use of terms like \"specific classification loan ratio,\" \"overdue and restructured loan ratio,\" and \"credit provision coverage ratio\" is largely consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio\" (Translation 4), which is grammatically incorrect and redundant.\n- The term \"specific classification loan ratio\" is used consistently, but \"specific loan classification ratio\" (Translation 3) is less standard and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n- The phrase \"the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\" is slightly more natural than \"delinquency ratios\" (used in some translations), though both are acceptable.\n- The explanation of the credit provision coverage ratio is slightly inconsistent in some translations, with some using \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loans\" and others using \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio,\" which is redundant.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"specific classification loan ratio\" consistently, as it is the most standard and clear phrasing.\n- Clarify the definition of \"credit provision coverage ratio\" to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.\n- Use \"delinquency rates\" consistently for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Ensure that the explanation of the credit provision coverage ratio is grammatically correct and concise.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe specific classification loan ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific classification loan ratio for related loans in mainland China was 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. This increase was primarily due to downgrades in the credit ratings of some mainland real estate developers. Nevertheless, banks maintained adequate provisions. As of the end of 2022, the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loans) remained approximately at 80%. If the liquidation value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the credit provision coverage ratio is approximately 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nNote: The figures include the Hong Kong office, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the performance of the banking sector in 2022, including changes in profitability, net interest margin, and cost-to-income ratios.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate translation of key financial terms such as \"pre-tax operating profit,\" \"net interest income,\" \"impairment provisions,\" and \"cost-to-income ratio.\"\n- Proper use of percentages and figures, with consistent formatting (e.g., \"+34%\", \"–19%\").\n- Clear structure and logical flow, maintaining the original text’s sequence of information.\n- Correct use of terms like \"foreign exchange and derivatives\" and \"rising interest rate environment.\"\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"banking system\" while others use \"banking sector.\" While both are acceptable, \"banking sector\" is more commonly used in financial reporting.\n- The term \"loan loss provisions\" is used in some translations, while others use \"impairment provisions\" or \"bad debt provisions.\" \"Impairment provisions\" is more precise in the context of accounting standards.\n- The phrase \"set aside special reserves\" is used in some translations, while others use \"set aside special provisions.\" \"Provisions\" is more standard in financial contexts.\n- The term \"expenses and commission income\" appears in one translation, which is slightly off; the original refers to \"費用與佣金收入,\" which should be \"fee and commission income.\"\n- Some translations use \"fell\" for \"decreased\" in the cost-to-income ratio, which is acceptable but \"decreased\" is more neutral and precise.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain consistency in terminology, use standard financial terminology, and ensure clarity and fluency.\n---\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Retail banks’ overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 19.0% during the year (Figure 7). The improvement in profitability was driven by higher net interest income (+34%) and increased income from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), although part of the growth was offset by an increase in impairment provisions (+151%) and a decline in fee and commission income (–19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility during the year also contributed to higher income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses. The increase in impairment provisions was due to the need to set aside special provisions for newly classified loans, while weak financial market performance led to a decline in fee and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banks decreased from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple caption for a figure, consisting of a title and a source. The junior translators have mostly captured the essential elements, but there are variations in terminology and formatting that affect clarity and professionalism.\n- **Translation 1** correctly uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" but this is not the official English name of the institution in Hong Kong. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Retail Banking\" with a capital \"B,\" which is acceptable but slightly inconsistent with the more common phrasing \"Retail Banks.\"\n- **Translation 3** is accurate and consistent with the official name of the institution and uses \"Retail Banks,\" which is more natural in this context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is ambiguous and less precise. It also uses \"Retail Banking\" with a capital \"B,\" which is less common in this context.\n- **Translation 5** is concise but abbreviates \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable in some contexts but may be less formal than using the full name.\n- **Translation 6** again omits \"Hong Kong\" from \"Monetary Authority,\" which is imprecise and could be confusing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full and official name of the institution: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"Retail Banks\" rather than \"Retail Banking\" for consistency with the singular \"Bank\" in the title.\n- Ensure proper punctuation and spacing between the title and source.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be:\n**Figure 7: Performance of Retail Banks  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority**\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a financial report or academic paper, and it includes the title of the figure and the source of the data. The goal is to translate this caption accurately and professionally into English.\n**Review of the Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is concise and accurate. It correctly captures the title and source.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It lacks the full name of the source, using only \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" without the acronym (HKMA), which is commonly used in financial contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** It includes both the full name and the acronym (HKMA), which is more informative and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The formatting is slightly inconsistent with the first translation, using a line break after the title.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** It rephrases the title slightly, using \"Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banking,\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The rephrasing is unnecessary and slightly less direct than the original. It also uses \"Data Source\" instead of \"Source,\" which is less standard in captions.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The title is accurate and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It omits the colon after \"Figure 9,\" which is standard in formal captions. It also lacks the acronym for the source.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** It rephrases the title in a slightly different way, which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Monetary Authority\" instead of the correct \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also omits the acronym.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The title is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is not the correct name of the organization.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and professional. It should include the full name of the source and its commonly used acronym. It should also follow standard formatting for captions, including the use of a colon after \"Figure 9\" and the word \"Source\" without unnecessary elaboration.\nThe second junior translator's version is the closest to being ideal, but it uses a line break after the title, which is not standard in formal captions. The first junior translator's version is also accurate but lacks the acronym. Therefore, the best approach is to combine the strengths of both: use the full name of the source with its acronym and follow standard formatting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality and readability of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key figures and percentages, ensuring numerical accuracy.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"balance sheet,\" \"foreign exchange,\" \"derivative holdings,\" and \"loan demand\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verbosity and Redundancy:** Some translations use slightly wordy phrasing, such as \"gains from marking foreign exchange and derivative holdings to market value\" (Translation 2), which is more complex than necessary.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** While all translations are grammatically correct, some phrases feel slightly stiff or overly literal. For example, \"Facing external uncertainties and rising interest rates\" (Translation 1) is correct but could be more fluidly phrased as \"Amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** There is a slight inconsistency in the use of terms like \"used outside Hong Kong\" versus \"used in Hong Kong\" (Translation 3), which could be standardized for clarity.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Mainland China-related loans\" is used in some translations, which is acceptable, but \"loans related to mainland China\" (Translation 6) is slightly more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain accuracy while enhancing fluency and naturalness. This involves:\n- Simplifying complex phrasing without losing precision.\n- Ensuring consistent terminology throughout the translation.\n- Using more idiomatic expressions where appropriate to improve readability.\n- Ensuring that the sentence structure in English flows naturally, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022, driven by an increase in the market value of foreign exchange and derivative holdings. Amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened throughout the year. Total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to a 3.8% increase in 2021. Specifically, loans used outside Hong Kong fell by 10.2%, trade financing declined by 13.5%, while loans used within Hong Kong rose slightly by 0.9%. Loans related to mainland China, which had grown by 3.7% in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the balance sheet, deposits in the banking system continued to grow at a moderate pace. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. As total loans declined while total deposits rose, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe original text discusses the capital adequacy of banks in 2022, highlighting key financial ratios and their comparison to international standards. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the main facts: the capital ratios, their comparison to the previous year, and their relation to international minimum requirements.\n- The use of terms like \"capital adequacy,\" \"Tier 1 capital ratio,\" and \"Basel III leverage ratio\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"combined capital adequacy ratio,\" which may be slightly misleading, as \"combined\" is not a standard term in this context.\n- The second and third translators use \"consolidated total capital ratio,\" which is more precise than \"combined\" but may be redundant since \"total capital ratio\" already implies consolidation.\n- The fifth and sixth translators use \"the bank's capital adequacy\" or \"capital position,\" which is slightly narrower than the original text, which refers to the banking sector in general, not just a single bank.\n- The third and fourth translators use \"significantly higher,\" which is more emphatic than \"well above\" used by the first and second translators. While both are acceptable, \"well above\" is more commonly used in financial reporting.\n- The fourth and sixth translators use \"stood at\" for the leverage ratio, which is slightly more formal and may be preferable in a formal report.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain precision, clarity, and consistency with standard financial terminology. The phrase \"capital position\" is slightly less precise than \"capital adequacy,\" and \"banking sector\" is more accurate than \"the bank's.\" The term \"consolidated total capital ratio\" is more precise than \"combined,\" and \"well above\" is more standard in financial contexts than \"significantly higher.\" The use of \"stood at\" for the leverage ratio adds a slight formality that is appropriate in a formal report.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe banking sector maintained ample capital adequacy in 2022. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally registered and authorized institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio stood at 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Recognized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and accurate, using \"robust\" and \"crucial pillar\" effectively. It correctly uses \"quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio\" and \"quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"serving as a crucial pillar amid heightened uncertainties,\" which is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"sound\" instead of \"robust,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still appropriate. It also uses \"worsening uncertainties\" instead of \"heightened,\" which is a subtle but acceptable rephrasing. The phrase \"stable funding net ratio\" is slightly awkward compared to \"net stable funding ratio.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"continued to remain stable\" instead of \"remained robust.\" The phrase \"serving as an important pillar amid the worsening uncertainties\" is slightly more wordy but still clear.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" instead of \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original Chinese terms. It also uses \"stable funding net amount ratio,\" which is not standard terminology. The phrase \"Tier 2A institutions\" is also not standard in financial terminology.\n5. **Translation 5** is very close to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"remains robust\" instead of \"has remained robust.\" It also uses \"continue to be the main source of funding,\" which is slightly more active than the original.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"banking sector\" instead of \"banking system,\" which is a minor variation. It also uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" instead of \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2,\" which may be a misinterpretation. The phrase \"at the end of 2022\" is slightly more formal than \"as of the end of 2022.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"banking system\" consistently, as it is the term used in the original Chinese.\n- Use \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" instead of \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" to match the original terminology.\n- Use \"net stable funding ratio\" and \"core funding ratio\" as standard financial terms.\n- Use \"as of the end of 2022\" for consistency with financial reporting standards.\n- Use \"remained robust\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the liquidity position.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe liquidity position of the banking system has remained robust, serving as a crucial pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). The primary source of funds for the banking system remains customer deposits. As of the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n"}

Driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and end-of-year seasonal funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) generally follows the trend of the U.S. dollar interbank offered rate (LIBOR). Due to the United States' continuous interest rate hikes, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate gradually increased throughout 2022. Overall, the foreign exchange and money markets of the Hong Kong dollar remained stable, with smooth and orderly transactions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, which outlines Hong Kong's monetary policy objective and the mechanism of the currency board system. However, they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to standard English usage and terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy as maintaining currency stability.\n- The exchange rate range (7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD) is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The concept of the currency board system is generally well conveyed, with most translations using \"currency board system\" or similar terms.\n- The requirement for 100% backing of the monetary base by USD reserves is accurately reflected in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"monetary base\" while others use \"money supply\" or \"currency issuance regime.\" The correct term in this context is \"monetary base,\" which refers to the total amount of money in circulation and bank reserves.\n- **Institutional Accuracy:** The original text refers to the \"Exchange Fund,\" which is the correct term for Hong Kong's official foreign exchange reserve fund. However, some translations incorrectly refer to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"currency issuance bureau system,\" which are not accurate in this context.\n- **Fluency and Redundancy:** Some translations are slightly redundant or awkward in phrasing, such as \"keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market,\" which is unnecessarily wordy.\n- **Mechanism Description:** The mechanism of the currency board system is not always clearly explained. For instance, the phrase \"fully matching the changes in the monetary base\" is better phrased as \"must be adjusted in full proportion to changes in the monetary base.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct institutional name: \"Exchange Fund\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"currency issuance bureau.\"\n- Use the correct economic term: \"monetary base\" instead of \"money supply.\"\n- Improve fluency by avoiding redundancy and using more concise phrasing.\n- Ensure that the mechanism of the currency board system is clearly and accurately described, emphasizing the 100% backing and proportional adjustment of USD reserves.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that is fluent, accurate, and uses the correct terminology, ensuring clarity and precision in conveying the mechanism of Hong Kong's monetary policy.\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and keeping it within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. If the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, in full proportion to the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Liability certificates (which provide full backing for banknotes issued by the three issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins;  \n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balances); and  \n- Foreign exchange fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to financial terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the entity responsible for maintaining the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.\n- The mechanism involving the automatic interest rate adjustment and the exchange guarantee is accurately described in all versions.\n- The key exchange rates (7.75 and 7.85) are consistently mentioned, and the actions of the HKMA (selling\/buying HKD and USD) are clearly outlined.\n- The causal relationship between the HKMA's actions and the resulting changes in interest rates and exchange rates is preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use imprecise or inconsistent terms, such as \"exchange guarantee\" versus \"convertibility undertaking\" or \"exchange rate guarantee.\" The term \"convertibility undertaking\" is more precise in the context of the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are overly wordy or repetitive, such as repeating \"Hong Kong dollars\" and \"U.S. dollars\" unnecessarily. Others use awkward phrasing, such as \"total surplus\" instead of \"total reserves\" or \"aggregate balance.\"\n- **Clarity of Mechanism:** Some translations obscure the logical flow of the mechanism, particularly the relationship between the HKMA's intervention and the resulting interest rate changes and exchange rate adjustments.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use precise financial terminology, such as \"convertibility undertaking\" instead of \"exchange guarantee.\"\n- Ensure clarity and conciseness in describing the HKMA's actions and their effects.\n- Maintain a logical flow by clearly linking the triggering of the mechanism, the HKMA's intervention, the resulting changes in reserves, the impact on interest rates, and the eventual stabilization of the exchange rate.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring the convertibility undertaking. When the strong-side (or weak-side) convertibility undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) total reserves, causing Hong Kong dollar interest rates to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the convertibility range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, they vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and clarity. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key factors influencing the Hong Kong dollar: local stock market adjustments, expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, and carry trades based on the interest rate differential between HIBOR and LIBOR.\n- The mention of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee being triggered 41 times between May and November is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The reference to the strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar in mid-November due to increased stock market activity and year-end funding demand is well captured in all versions.\n- The final sentence about the normal functioning of the foreign exchange market is consistently translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"weak exchange rate guarantee\" while others use \"weak-side conversion rate guarantee\" or \"weak-side convertibility undertaking.\" This inconsistency may confuse readers. The most accurate and commonly used term in financial contexts is \"weak-side exchange rate guarantee.\"\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use phrases like \"arbitrage activities\" or \"carry trade activities\" which, while not incorrect, are less common in financial reporting than \"carry trades.\" Additionally, \"resurgence in local stock market trading activity\" is slightly wordy compared to \"revival in local stock market trading activity.\"\n- **Clarity and Flow:** Some translations are slightly awkward in structure, such as \"With increased stock market turnover in Hong Kong and seasonal funding demands at year-end, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen from mid-November (see Figure 1).\" A smoother phrasing would be more natural in English financial writing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"weak-side exchange rate guarantee.\"\n- Opt for more natural and commonly used financial terms, such as \"carry trades\" instead of \"carry trade activities.\"\n- Improve sentence flow and clarity, particularly in the transition from weakening to strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain accuracy, use consistent and standard financial terminology, and ensure natural, fluent English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong dollar weakened in early 2022, driven by adjustments in the local stock market, market expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes, and carry trades fueled by the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). It remained close to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level in the following months, with the guarantee being triggered 41 times between May and November. In mid-November, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen, supported by a revival in local stock market trading activity and year-end seasonal funding demand (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an additional HKD 40 billion worth of Exchange Fund Notes at the beginning of 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion at the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in response to requests from banks. The total reserves decreased from HKD 3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Notes and the triggering of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Meanwhile, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds increased slightly during the year from HKD 11,488 billion to HKD 12,004 billion. As a result, the total reserves plus the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds decreased from HKD 15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rates\nThe original text, \"圖1 2022年市場匯率,\" is a caption for a figure, likely from a report or academic paper, indicating that the figure presents exchange rates for the year 2022.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate but vary slightly in punctuation and pluralization. The first and fourth translations use a colon after \"Figure 1\" and are missing the colon in their formatting, which is inconsistent with standard English caption formatting. The second, fifth, and sixth translations correctly use a colon after \"Figure 1\" and pluralize \"Exchange Rates,\" which is appropriate if the figure shows multiple exchange rates. The third translation uses a colon but incorrectly omits the plural form of \"Rates.\"\nThe most appropriate translation should follow standard English caption formatting, which typically includes a colon after \"Figure 1\" and uses the plural form \"Exchange Rates\" if the figure presents multiple rates. Based on this reasoning, the best translation would be:\n**Figure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rates**\n\nFigure 2: Summary of 2022 Balances (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of U.S. dollar interbank offered rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes in the United States in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). Over the course of the year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range, the benchmark rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (i.e., 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the U.S. policy rate hikes, several banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by another 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the upper limit of new mortgage interest rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in the face of challenges. Despite the volatile global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting the system's robustness and effectiveness. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in its \"2022 External Sector Report\" that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal frameworks, all of which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience to shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Issuance Office's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial fiscal resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong backing for the maintenance of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio for 2022\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nThe first translation, \"Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2022,\" is grammatically correct but lacks the preposition \"in\" after \"for 2022,\" which slightly reduces clarity. The second translation, \"Daily fluctuations in the support ratio for 2022,\" is more natural and fluent, using the plural form \"fluctuations\" which is more commonly used in such contexts. The third translation uses \"Support Rate\" instead of \"Support Ratio,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original term. \"Rate\" and \"Ratio\" have distinct meanings in technical contexts, so this is a notable weakness. The fourth translation, \"Daily Changes in the Support Ratio for 2022,\" is also accurate and natural, using \"changes\" as a more general and commonly used term than \"fluctuations.\" The fifth translation, \"Figure 4 Daily Changes in Support Ratio in 2022,\" omits the preposition \"for\" after \"2022,\" which is less preferred in formal writing. The sixth translation, \"Figure 4 Daily Variation of Support Ratio in 2022,\" uses \"variation\" instead of \"fluctuation\" or \"change,\" which is less precise in the context of daily changes.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"fluctuations\" as it is the most precise term for describing daily changes in a ratio. It is also more commonly used in statistical or graphical contexts. The preposition \"for\" is more appropriate than \"in\" when referring to the year in relation to the data being presented. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be: \"Figure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio for 2022.\" This version maintains grammatical correctness, uses appropriate terminology, and adheres to standard English conventions for such captions.\n\n# Monetary Policy Committee\n\nThe original text discusses the responsibilities of the Currency Board under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the topics it examined in 2022, and the availability of related documents on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) website. The junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the Monetary Policy Committee but misrepresents the structure of the Hong Kong monetary system. The term \"Monetary Policy Committee\" is not accurate in this context, as the correct body is the Currency Board. Additionally, the phrase \"Monetary Authority system\" is misleading and should be \"Currency Board system.\"\n**Translation 2** uses the term \"Currency Board\" correctly and accurately reflects the structure of the Hong Kong monetary system. However, it uses \"Currency Board System Operation Reports\" which is not the standard term used by the HKMA. The term \"Currency Board\" is appropriate, but the structure of the sentence could be improved for clarity.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"Currency Board Committee\" instead of \"Currency Board,\" which is not accurate. The term \"Currency Board Committee\" is not used in official HKMA documents. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Currency Board Sub-committee,\" which is not the correct term. The term \"Sub-committee\" is not used in the official structure of the HKMA. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Translation 5** again uses \"Monetary Policy Committee\" incorrectly and misrepresents the structure of the HKMA. The term \"Monetary Authority's system\" is also misleading. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Translation 6** correctly identifies the \"Currency Board\" and accurately reflects the structure of the HKMA. It uses the correct term \"Currency Board system\" and accurately describes the availability of documents on the HKMA website. However, the phrase \"non-banking institutions\" should be \"non-bank institutions\" to match the standard terminology used in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the structure of the HKMA, use the correct terminology, and maintain fluency and clarity. Based on the above analysis, Translation 6 is the closest to being accurate, but it can be improved by using the correct term \"non-bank institutions\" and ensuring that the structure of the HKMA is accurately represented.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Currency Board, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2022, topics discussed by the Currency Board included the property market situation in mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a framework for monitoring the liquidity of the Hong Kong dollar. Meeting minutes of the Currency Board and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\nBanknotes and Coins\n# Paper Money and Coins\nPaper Money and Coins\n# Paper Money and Coins\nPaper Money and Coins\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in formatting and style. The first, third, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Paper Money and Coins\" or \"Banknotes and Coins,\" which are both acceptable terms. \"Banknotes\" is more formal and commonly used in official or financial contexts, while \"Paper Money\" is more colloquial. \"Coins\" is standard in both cases.\nThe second and fifth translations include the \"#\" symbol at the beginning, which may be appropriate if the text is part of a larger document with section headings. However, without additional context, it is unclear whether this formatting is necessary.\nThe primary differences between the translations are in the choice of terminology and formatting. \"Banknotes and Coins\" is slightly more formal and precise, while \"Paper Money and Coins\" is more widely understood. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol may be appropriate in certain contexts but is not essential for the translation itself.\nConsidering these factors, the best possible translation would be \"Banknotes and Coins\" as it is more formal and precise, and it avoids unnecessary formatting unless specified by the context.\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\nThe original text is \"# 香港鈔票,\" which translates to \"Hong Kong Banknotes\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are close to the correct translation. However, there are a few nuances to consider.\nThe use of \"Banknotes\" is the most accurate and standard term for paper currency issued by a government or central bank. \"Notes\" is a more informal and less precise term, typically used in contexts like \"currency notes\" or \"paper notes.\" \"Bills\" is also a term used for paper currency, but it is more commonly associated with U.S. dollars or other currencies in specific contexts, and may not be as universally understood in the context of Hong Kong's currency.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Banknotes\" with proper capitalization and punctuation, which is appropriate for a title. The third translation uses \"Notes,\" which is less precise, and the sixth uses \"Bills,\" which is also less standard in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"Hong Kong Banknotes,\" as it is the most accurate, standard, and widely understood term for the paper currency issued by Hong Kong. It maintains the proper capitalization and punctuation, and it is culturally and linguistically appropriate.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to educate various groups—bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students—about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The goal is to improve their ability to identify genuine currency. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message, but there are areas for improvement in terms of fluency, consistency, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the purpose of the seminars.\n- The key terms such as \"bank tellers,\" \"retail cashiers,\" \"students,\" \"design,\" \"anti-counterfeiting features,\" and \"identifying banknotes\" are consistently translated.\n- The numerical data (15 seminars, over 4,200 participants) is accurately represented in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"lectures\" instead of \"seminars,\" which is less precise in this context. \"Seminars\" is more appropriate for structured educational sessions.\n- The phrase \"enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying genuine currency\" is repeated in several translations, which, while accurate, lacks variation and could be phrased more naturally.\n- The use of \"thereby\" in one translation (\"thereby enhancing their knowledge...\") is somewhat redundant and could be omitted for smoother flow.\n- Some translations use \"conducted\" or \"organized\" instead of \"held,\" which is acceptable but \"held\" is more commonly used in such contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"seminars\" consistently to maintain clarity and precision.\n- Vary the phrasing of the purpose clause to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n- Ensure consistency in verb usage (e.g., \"held\" is preferable to \"conducted\" or \"organized\" in this context).\n- Use \"banknotes\" consistently instead of switching between \"banknotes\" and \"currency.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to hold seminars to educate bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, thereby improving their ability to identify genuine notes. In 2022, the HKMA held a total of 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collecting Program\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be popular among the public. Details of the program can be found in the chapter titled \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Sustainable Development\" in the 2022 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\nThe original Chinese text, \"# 外匯基金票據及債券,\" translates to a title or heading related to financial instruments issued by a foreign exchange fund. The junior translators have provided several variations, with the primary difference being the use of \"Notes\" versus \"Bills\" and the inclusion of a \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate use of \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and the correct terms \"Notes\" and \"Bonds.\" However, there are some nuances to consider. \"Notes\" typically refer to short-term debt instruments, while \"Bills\" are also short-term but often used in a more general sense. In this context, \"Notes\" is more precise and commonly used in financial terminology. The use of \"#\" in some translations is unnecessary unless the original text is intended to be a heading or section title in a document, which is not clear from the given text.\nThe most consistent and accurate translation is \"Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds,\" which is used by the first, fourth, and sixth junior translators. This translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and uses appropriate financial terminology. It accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without unnecessary symbols or variations in terminology.\n\nThe original text discusses the smooth operation of the Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Programme, the issuance of additional notes by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in early 2022, and the resulting reduction in outstanding amounts, culminating in a figure of approximately 12,075 billion Hong Kong dollars as of the end of 2022.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"outstanding amount\" and \"nominal value.\" The figure of 1.2075 trillion HKD is correctly converted from 12,075 billion. However, \"Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Scheme\" may not be the most precise term; \"Programme\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** The use of \"Program\" instead of \"Programme\" is a minor issue, and the figure of 120.75 billion HKD is incorrect (should be 12,075 billion). This is a critical error that misrepresents the data.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The term \"Bills\" is used instead of \"Notes,\" which may be inaccurate. The figure of 12,075 billion HKD is correct, but \"Bills and Bond Programme\" is not the standard term.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The figure of 400 billion HKD is incorrect (should be 40 billion), and the final figure of 1,207.5 billion HKD is also incorrect (should be 12,075 billion). These errors significantly distort the meaning.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, with the correct figures and appropriate terminology. The use of \"HK$\" is acceptable, though \"HKD\" is more formal in financial contexts. The term \"aggregate balance\" is slightly less precise than \"total outstanding amount.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with the correct figures and terminology. The use of \"Hong Kong dollars\" is slightly more verbose than \"HKD,\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct terminology (\"Programme\" rather than \"Program\" or \"Scheme\"), ensure accurate numerical conversions (12,075 billion HKD = 1.2075 trillion HKD), and maintain a formal, professional tone consistent with financial reporting. It should also use \"HKD\" for consistency with financial documents and avoid informal abbreviations like \"HK$.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a total of HKD 40 billion in Exchange Fund Notes during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the total outstanding amount. As of the end of 2022, the nominal value of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds amounted to approximately HKD 1.2075 trillion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\nThe original Chinese text is \"表2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券,\" which translates to \"Table 2 Unpaid Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with slight differences in terminology and punctuation.\nThe term \"未償還\" can be translated as either \"Unpaid\" or \"Outstanding.\" While both are acceptable, \"Outstanding\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to obligations that remain unpaid. Therefore, \"Outstanding\" is a more natural and precise choice in this context.\nThe terms \"票據\" and \"債券\" are translated as either \"Notes\" and \"Bonds\" or \"Bills\" and \"Bonds.\" \"Notes\" is the more standard financial term for \"票據,\" while \"Bills\" is less commonly used in this context. \"Bonds\" is the correct translation for \"債券.\"\nPunctuation is also a point of variation. Some translations use a colon after \"Table 2,\" while others do not. In formal English, it is more common to use a colon after the table number when listing the title.\nTaking these considerations into account, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"Table 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds.\" This translation uses the more appropriate financial terminology and follows standard English punctuation conventions.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, style, and fluency that can be refined for greater clarity and professionalism.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the organization as the \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" or a similar variation, which is crucial for institutional accuracy.\n- The key activities—completing policy reports, publishing research papers, and hosting seminars\/webinars—are consistently translated and clearly presented.\n- The mention of the new open-access electronic journal and the publication series \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest\" is well captured in all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"high-level, non-technical summaries\" is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"HKIMFR\" (Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research), while others use the full name or variations like \"Research Centre.\" For consistency, it is better to use the full name once and then use the acronym if needed.\n- **Verb Tense and Structure:** Some translations use \"has completed\" and \"has published,\" which is grammatically correct but may be more naturally phrased as \"completed\" and \"published\" without the auxiliary verb for a more concise tone.\n- **Word Choice:** The phrase \"made further arrangements\" is somewhat vague and could be replaced with more direct language such as \"implemented\" or \"launched.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"enabling a broader audience to access the relevant information\" or \"ensuring a broader audience can access the information,\" which are slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing like \"making the information accessible to a broader audience\" is more natural in English.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"readership\" is used in one translation, which is slightly more formal than \"audience\" or \"readers,\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the full name of the organization once and then use the acronym if needed for brevity.\n- Use concise and active verb forms to enhance readability.\n- Replace vague phrases like \"made further arrangements\" with more direct language.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and style throughout the translation.\n- Use natural English phrasing that aligns with academic and institutional communication norms.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMFR) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars and webinars covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMFR also launched a new open-access electronic journal to disseminate its research findings, making the information accessible to a broader audience. In addition, the HKIMFR introduced a new publication series titled \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest\" on its website, which summarizes the Institute’s recent research findings and provides high-level, non-technical overviews for the public.\n\nIn addition to its research findings, the research center also hosted two international conferences and three online expert forums to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial matters.\n\nOn April 12, the School of Finance co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Recent Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening of Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore Renminbi Market,\" featuring guest speakers Mr. Norman Chan, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Yiping Huang, Deputy Dean and Tan Choon Hong Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University. The seminar was live-streamed across multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real-time.\n\nA webinar on “Transformation and Policy Choices in the Chinese Real Estate Industry” was held on June 24, featuring Ms. Qin Hong, a senior researcher at Renmin University and former director of the Policy Research Center under the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a keynote speaker, and moderated by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS. The event attracted nearly 1.13 million live online viewers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions worldwide.\n\nOn August 25, an online workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects\" was jointly organized with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, with over 200 experts from central banks, international financial institutions, and academia around the world participating online.\n\nAs an additional event outside the main program of the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, an online seminar titled \"Inflation After the Coronavirus: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was jointly organized with the School of Finance on November 2. The seminar featured Dr. Quilin Li, founder and chief economist of the International Monetary Observation and former chief economist at J.P. Morgan, who provided analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated in the seminar online.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, title consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall fluency and professionalism of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the event as the \"12th Annual\" and capture the main theme: \"A New Stage of China's Economic Development.\"\n- The names and titles of Dr. Wang Yiming are consistently translated, with minor variations in the use of \"Vice Chairman\" vs. \"Deputy Chairman\" and \"Director of the Academic Committee.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations including the key elements: the event, the keynote speech, the panel discussion, and the online viewership.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Event Title Inconsistency:** The original Chinese uses the term “研討會” (conference or seminar), but the translations use different terms: \"Conference,\" \"Forum,\" \"Seminar,\" and \"Symposium.\" While these are all acceptable, using a consistent term (e.g., \"Conference\") would enhance clarity and professionalism.\n- **Title of the Organization:** The original Chinese refers to “中國國際經濟交流中心” (China International Center for Economic Exchange), but translations vary between \"China Center for International Economic Exchanges\" and \"China International Economic Exchange Center.\" The latter is more accurate and consistent with official English names.\n- **\"Greater China\" vs. \"Greater China region\":** Some translations use \"Greater China region,\" which is slightly redundant. \"Greater China\" alone is sufficient and more concise.\n- **\"Pandemic prevention\" vs. \"pandemic control\":** While both are acceptable, \"pandemic prevention\" is more commonly used in official contexts, though \"pandemic control\" is also accurate.\n- **\"Online viewers in real-time\" vs. \"online live viewers\":** \"Online viewers in real-time\" is slightly awkward. \"Online live viewers\" or \"real-time online viewers\" is more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use a consistent event title, such as \"Conference.\"\n- Ensure the name of the organization is translated consistently as \"China International Center for Economic Exchange.\"\n- Use \"Greater China\" without the redundant \"region.\"\n- Use \"pandemic prevention\" for consistency with official terminology.\n- Use \"real-time online viewers\" or \"online live viewers\" for clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 12th Annual China Economic International Conference was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Stage of China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Deputy Chairman of the China International Center for Economic Exchange and Director of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech at the conference on China's short-term and long-term economic outlook. In addition, four chief economists for Greater China from different investment banks shared their views on China's pandemic prevention policies, the development of the real estate market, supply chain restructuring, and long-term growth prospects during a panel discussion session. The conference attracted over 1.18 million real-time online viewers.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking System Stability\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, but they all essentially convey the same meaning. However, there are some nuances to consider.\nThe first junior translator's translation, \"Banking system stable,\" is grammatically incorrect in this context. It should be \"Banking system stability\" or \"Banking system is stable\" to be grammatically correct. The second and sixth junior translators used \"Banking System Stability\" with \"System\" capitalized, which is appropriate if it refers to a specific system or is part of a title. The third and fifth junior translators used \"banking system stability\" with lowercase \"system,\" which is also acceptable in general contexts. The fourth junior translator included the hashtag \"#,\" which is consistent with the original text but may not be necessary in all contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Banking System Stability\" with \"System\" capitalized, as it is a proper noun referring to a specific system. This translation is concise, accurate, and maintains the original meaning.\n\nDespite the uncertainties and challenges in the macroeconomic environment, as well as abnormal fluctuations in financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2022. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened its regulatory oversight of credit and market risk management at authorized institutions. Furthermore, in light of the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector, the HKMA closely collaborated with authorized institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"resilient\" and \"operational resilience\" is appropriate. However, \"abnormal fluctuations\" could be slightly more natural as \"abnormal volatility\" or \"unusual volatility.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and includes the acronym in parentheses, which is good for clarity. The phrase \"regulatory oversight\" is more precise than \"supervision\" in this context. The only minor issue is the use of \"at authorized institutions\" which is slightly less formal than \"for authorized institutions.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also strong. It uses \"sound\" instead of \"resilient,\" which is a slight variation in meaning but still acceptable. The phrase \"regulatory oversight over\" is slightly less natural than \"regulatory oversight of.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very natural and fluent. It uses \"banking sector\" instead of \"banking system,\" which is a slight variation but still accurate. The phrase \"cybersecurity capabilities\" is slightly more concise than \"cyber defense capabilities.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilient\" and \"cyber defense capabilities\" appropriately. The only minor issue is the use of \"the macro environment\" instead of \"the macroeconomic environment,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"robust\" instead of \"resilient,\" which is a slight variation in meaning but still acceptable. The phrase \"cybersecurity capabilities\" is slightly more concise than \"cyber defense capabilities.\"\nOverall, the translations are very similar in meaning and quality. The best possible translation would combine the strengths of each, using precise terminology, consistent acronyms, and natural phrasing. The final translation should be fluent, accurate, and reflect the nuances of the original text.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six versions are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and cultural appropriateness.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate rendering of key terms such as \"HKMA,\" \"buy now, pay later,\" \"virtual assets,\" and \"trust business.\" Most translations also maintain a formal tone appropriate for regulatory texts. The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\nWeaknesses include inconsistent use of terminology. For example, \"多間信貸資料服務機構\" is translated as \"multiple credit information service providers,\" \"multiple credit reference agencies,\" or \"multiple credit data agencies.\" While all are acceptable, \"credit information service providers\" is the most precise and consistent with the original. Similarly, \"滾動的壞蘋果\" is translated as \"rotting apple,\" \"rolling bad apples,\" or \"rolling bad debts.\" The phrase \"rolling bad apples\" is the most idiomatic and aligns with the intended metaphor of ongoing, recurring issues.\nFluency and grammar are mostly sound, though some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"help customers restart their bank accounts\" versus \"enable customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\" The latter is more natural in formal English.\nCultural appropriateness is not a major concern here, as the content is regulatory and technical, and the translations are all professional in tone.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain consistency in terminology, ensure natural and fluent English, and preserve the formal tone appropriate for regulatory texts. The translation should also accurately reflect the nuances of the original, such as the metaphor \"rolling bad apples.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would use precise terminology, maintain a consistent and natural flow, and ensure clarity and professionalism.\nThe HKMA has strengthened consumer protection for \"buy now, pay later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. It has also collaborated with other regulatory authorities to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new trust business regulatory regime. This year, the \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new mandatory background verification program to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon. In addition, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in introducing convenient measures to enable customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with banks through public-private partnerships (including the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force) to strengthen Hong Kong's ecosystem for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as enhance efforts to address fraud cases. Additionally, the HKMA has partnered with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage risks and instabilities arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA has also further promoted the industry's use of data and technology through its \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Tech Lab\" series, while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in its anti-money laundering efforts. In international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn 2022, good progress was made in the implementation of international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards, locally. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively enhanced the industry's soft power by collaborating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of existing professionals. Throughout the year, the HKMA maintained close cooperation with the banking industry to refine and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reflect its ongoing efforts at both local and international levels.\n- The key initiatives—developing new resolution standards, conducting crisis simulations, and establishing loss-absorbing capacity—are consistently captured across all translations.\n- The phrase \"marking a milestone\" is effectively used in all versions to highlight the significance of these efforts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Resolution mechanism\" vs. \"resolution regime\" vs. \"resolvability\":** While \"resolution mechanism\" is the most commonly used term in financial contexts, \"resolution regime\" and \"resolvability\" are also acceptable. However, \"resolvability\" is more abstract and less commonly used in formal policy documents, making it slightly less appropriate in this context.\n- **\"Locally systemically important banks\" vs. \"systemically important local banks\" vs. \"banks deemed systemically important to Hong Kong\":** The phrase \"systemically important local banks\" is more concise and natural in English. However, \"banks deemed systemically important to Hong Kong\" is more precise and aligns better with the original Chinese, which emphasizes the local importance of these banks.\n- **\"Loss-absorbing capacity resources\" vs. \"loss-absorption capacity resources\":** The correct term is \"loss-absorbing capacity,\" which is a standard term in financial regulation. \"Loss-absorption\" is a less common variant and may be confusing.\n- **\"Feasibility of resolution\" vs. \"resolution feasibility\":** \"Feasibility of resolution\" is more natural and commonly used in formal writing than \"resolution feasibility.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"resolution mechanism\" as the standard term in financial contexts.\n- Use \"systemically important local banks\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"loss-absorbing capacity\" as the standard financial term.\n- Use \"feasibility of resolution\" for natural phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific initiatives include developing new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all systemically important local banks, marking a milestone in the HKMA’s efforts to enhance the feasibility of resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the essential financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their operational practices, or in extreme cases, through disorderly collapses. As the regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a vital role in maintaining financial stability, ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks and restoring normalcy in times of crisis, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for prudentially regulating banks and authorizing Hong Kong-licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively known as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to ensure that, in the event an authorized institution becomes unsustainable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong's resolution framework, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\nThe original text discusses the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in overseeing financial market infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of safety, efficiency, transparency, and resilience in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Financial management officers\" which may not be the most precise term for the role described. The term \"HKMA\" is used consistently, which is good. However, \"operational interruptions\" is slightly awkward compared to \"disruptions in operations.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is concise and clear. It uses \"overseeing\" and \"strengthening\" effectively. However, it omits the role of the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and instead attributes the role to the HKMA, which may not be accurate based on the original text.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and uses \"supervising\" and \"resilience\" appropriately. However, the phrase \"prevent potential impacts on stability caused by operational disruptions\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version incorrectly identifies the role as belonging to the \"Financial Secretary,\" which is not accurate. It also uses \"such infrastructures\" consistently, which is good, but the term \"Financial Secretary\" is misleading in this context.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and well-written. It correctly attributes the role to the HKMA and uses \"such infrastructures\" consistently. However, it omits the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and may not fully reflect the original text's structure.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and uses \"overseeing\" and \"resilience\" effectively. However, the phrase \"due to disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructures\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text's structure and terminology, using precise and natural English. It should correctly identify the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" as the entity responsible for designating and supervising financial market infrastructure, and the HKMA as the entity responsible for monitoring and ensuring safety, efficiency, transparency, and resilience.\nThe translation should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing while maintaining clarity and fluency. It should also use consistent terminology, such as \"financial market infrastructures\" or \"financial market infrastructure\" depending on context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority oversees these infrastructures with the aim of enhancing their overall safety and efficiency, controlling systemic risks, and increasing transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures helps safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems and prevents potential impacts on their stability caused by disruptions in their operations.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nThe original text discusses regulatory actions taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding overseas trading platforms and local banks. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Supervisory Administration,\" which is incorrect. The correct body is the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" Also, \"currency brokers\" is acceptable, but \"money brokers\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"offshore trading platforms,\" which is a more precise term than \"overseas.\" However, \"recognition status\" is slightly awkward; \"recognition\" alone is more natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"money brokers,\" which is more natural. However, \"restricted license bank\" should be \"bank with a restricted license\" for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"foreign trading platforms,\" which is less precise than \"overseas\" or \"offshore.\" Also, \"had their recognition revoked\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"authorized\" and \"currency brokers.\" The phrase \"had their authorization revoked\" is natural and clear. However, \"bank with a restricted license\" is more precise than \"restricted license bank.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is incomplete. Also, \"recognition qualifications\" is redundant and awkward.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use precise terminology such as \"offshore trading platforms\" or \"overseas trading platforms.\"\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"money brokers\" or \"currency brokers\" depending on context.\n- Clearly express the revocation of recognition using natural English phrasing, such as \"had their recognition revoked.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority approved six offshore trading platforms to become money brokers, while five licensed banks and one bank with a restricted license had their recognition revoked.\n\nFor more information regarding accredited institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices on pages 283 to 286 and Tables D to F on pages 292 to 295.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Oversight\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and conducted 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts regular on-site inspections of the various business operations of authorized institutions. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is one of the key areas of focus. At the same time, given the increasing use of technology by banks, operational and technology risk management have become another key regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also carried out a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses, complemented by thematic assessments to examine categories assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\nThe provided translations are all quite similar and mostly accurate in conveying the meaning of the original Chinese text, which is \"表1 監管工作概要.\" The term \"監管工作\" can be translated as either \"regulatory work\" or \"supervisory work,\" both of which are acceptable depending on the context. \"概要\" is best translated as \"overview\" or \"summary,\" with \"overview\" being slightly more natural in English for headings or titles.\nThe first junior translator used \"Summary of Regulatory Work,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common as a title compared to \"Overview.\" The second and third translators used \"Regulatory Work Overview\" and \"Overview of Regulatory Work,\" respectively. The latter is more natural in English as it follows the typical structure of \"Overview of [Topic].\" The fourth translation omitted the colon, which is not ideal for formal titles. The fifth translator used \"Supervisory Work,\" which is a valid alternative to \"Regulatory Work,\" but may be less precise depending on the context. The sixth translation repeated the first one, using \"Summary of Regulatory Work.\"\nConsidering fluency, grammar, and natural English usage, \"Overview of Regulatory Work\" is the most appropriate and natural translation for this title. It is concise, grammatically correct, and follows standard English conventions for headings and titles.\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe original text provides a concise summary of loan and advance data for 2022 and 2021, with references to specific tables. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and numerical formatting.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the percentage changes in loan amounts for 2022 and 2021.\n- The references to \"Table 2\" and \"Table 3\" are consistently included.\n- The term \"loans and advances\" is appropriately used in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical formatting:** The number \"45,220億港元\" should be translated as \"HK$452.2 billion\" (not \"45,220 billion HK dollars\" or \"HKD 4.522 trillion\"), as the comma in the original is a thousand separator, not a decimal. This is a critical error in several translations.\n- **Terminology:** \"Mainland China-related loans\" is more natural than \"related loans within the mainland\" or \"related loans in Mainland China.\"\n- **Fluency and grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"The total amount of related loans within the mainland also decreased by 4.4% to 45,220 billion HK dollars,\" which is both grammatically incorrect and numerically inaccurate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure correct numerical formatting: \"45,220億港元\" = \"HK$452.2 billion.\"\n- Use consistent and natural phrasing, such as \"Mainland China-related loans.\"\n- Maintain parallel structure in the comparison between 2022 and 2021.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in the sentence structure.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nTotal loan amounts decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances. Mainland China-related loans also decreased by 4.4% to HK$452.2 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key factors affecting the banking system: the fifth wave of the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes, and the financial deterioration of mainland real estate developers.\n- The phrase \"remained stable and sound\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Within the year\"** (used in Translation 1) is somewhat awkward and less natural than alternatives like \"throughout the year\" or \"during the year.\"\n- **\"From various sources\"** (used in Translations 1, 2, 3, and 6) is slightly vague. A more precise phrase like \"from various fronts\" (used in Translation 4) or \"from multiple sources\" might be better.\n- **\"The fifth wave of the pandemic\"** (used in Translations 3 and 6) is slightly less specific than \"the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic\" (used in Translations 1, 2, and 5), which is more precise and avoids ambiguity.\n- **\"Worsening financial conditions\"** (used in Translation 6) is slightly less formal than \"deteriorating financial conditions\" (used in most translations), though both are acceptable.\n- **\"The banking sector\"** (used in Translation 4) is slightly different from \"the banking system\" (used in the other translations), but both are correct and contextually appropriate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"throughout the year\" for a more natural and commonly used expression.\n- Use \"from various fronts\" to convey the idea of multiple sources of pressure more effectively.\n- Maintain the full name \"the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic\" for clarity and specificity.\n- Use \"deteriorating financial conditions\" for consistency and formality.\n- Ensure consistency in referring to the banking system throughout the translation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing, precise vocabulary, and consistent terminology to produce a fluent and accurate English version of the original Chinese text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThroughout the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various fronts, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, the aggressive pace of interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe original text discusses the deterioration in the asset quality of the banking system, while still maintaining a healthy level. It also provides specific figures for the \"specific classified loan ratio\" in the banking sector and for loans related to the Mainland.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"special mention loan ratio\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. However, \"special mention\" is a term used in some credit risk classifications, but \"specific classified loan ratio\" may be more precise in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"specific classified loan ratio\" instead of \"special mention loan ratio.\" This is more consistent with the original Chinese term, which refers to a specific classification of loans, not necessarily \"special mention.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second, with the only difference being the use of \"higher than\" instead of \"up from.\" While both are correct, \"up from\" is more commonly used in financial reporting to indicate a rise from a previous period.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"non-performing loan ratio\" instead of \"specific classified loan ratio.\" This is a significant error, as \"non-performing loans\" refer to loans that are in default, which is a different classification than the one described in the original text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation also uses \"specific non-performing loan ratio,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"within the year\" instead of \"during the year,\" which is slightly less common in financial contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"specific classification loan ratio\" and \"mainland-related loans,\" which are appropriate terms. The structure is clear and the language is natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct financial terminology, maintain clarity, and follow natural English phrasing. Based on the above review, the most accurate and fluent translation would use \"specific classified loan ratio\" and avoid the incorrect term \"non-performing loan ratio.\" It should also use \"up from\" to indicate a rise from a previous period and ensure that the term \"mainland-related loans\" is used consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The specific classified loan ratio in the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classified loan ratio for mainland-related loans rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has broadened and deepened its risk monitoring and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of these institutions. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The results of the HKMA's stress tests on debt servicing capacity indicate that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers and can withstand extreme stress scenarios.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) planned thematic assessment of authorized institutions' credit risk management, with specific areas of focus. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"authorized institutions\" and \"secured loans\" appropriately. However, it uses \"will conduct\" which implies a future action, while the original text uses \"在年內進行\" which can be interpreted as \"conduct during the year\" rather than a definitive future action.\n**Translation 2** is very close to the original, using \"conducted\" which may be slightly off if the assessment is still planned rather than completed. It uses \"more vulnerable industries\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2, with \"review\" instead of \"assessment\" and \"more vulnerable industries.\" It is fluent and accurate, though \"review\" may not be as precise as \"assessment\" in this context.\n**Translation 4** uses \"HKMA\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It uses \"sectors\" instead of \"industries,\" which is a minor variation but still accurate. The use of \"conducted\" may be slightly off if the assessment is still planned.\n**Translation 5** uses \"licensed institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is a key difference. In Hong Kong's regulatory context, \"authorized institutions\" is the correct term. It also uses \"overseas branches\" instead of \"branches outside Hong Kong,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Translation 6** uses \"will conduct\" which is appropriate if the assessment is planned for this year. It uses \"mortgage lending\" instead of \"secured loans,\" which is a more specific term but may not fully capture the original's intent. \"Outside of Hong Kong\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"authorized institutions\" to match the original's regulatory terminology. It should use \"conducted\" if the assessment is already completed or \"will conduct\" if it is planned. \"Credit risk management\" is more precise than \"credit risk management practices.\" \"More vulnerable sectors\" is slightly more general than \"industries\" but still acceptable. \"Secured loans\" is more accurate than \"mortgage lending\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic assessment during the year to review the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk exposure to more vulnerable sectors, credit risk at branches outside Hong Kong, and secured loans provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the whole, the translations are accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and the use of institutional abbreviations that affect the overall quality.\nThe first translation uses \"licensed institutions\" consistently and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in full, which is appropriate. However, \"enabling individual licensed institutions to coordinate cooperation from a perspective of shared interests\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\nThe second translation uses \"authorized institutions\" instead of \"licensed institutions,\" which may be less precise in the context of Hong Kong's financial regulatory framework. It also uses \"address situations where companies encounter repayment difficulties,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nThe third translation uses \"authorized institutions\" again and \"cooperate in a coordinated manner,\" which is redundant. It also uses \"Business Financial Distress Handling Code\" instead of \"Corporate Financial Difficulties,\" which may not be the official title.\nThe fourth translation uses \"enterprises\" instead of \"businesses\" or \"companies,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context. It also uses \"Guidelines\" instead of \"Code of Practice,\" which may not be the correct term.\nThe fifth translation uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is appropriate for a more concise text. It also uses \"enterprises\" and \"authorized institutions,\" which are consistent with the others.\nThe sixth translation uses \"borrowers\" instead of \"enterprises\" or \"businesses,\" which may be less precise. It also uses \"Code of Practice on Handling Corporate Financial Difficulties in Hong Kong,\" which is more precise in terms of the title but slightly wordy.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would use \"licensed institutions\" for consistency with Hong Kong's regulatory terminology, \"HKMA\" as an appropriate abbreviation, and the most accurate title for the code. It should also be concise and fluent.\nFinal Translation:\nOn the other hand, in the challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of enterprises are facing financial difficulties. The HKMA encourages licensed institutions to handle cases where enterprises encounter repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the \"Code of Practice on Handling Corporate Financial Difficulties in Hong Kong,\" thereby enabling individual licensed institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the relevant lending institutions.\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple table title: “表3 內地相關貸款增長,” which translates to “Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China.” The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\n- **Translation 1** (“Table 3 Growth in Domestic-related Loans”) is concise but uses “Domestic-related,” which is not a standard term in financial contexts. It may confuse readers unfamiliar with the phrasing.\n  \n- **Translation 2** (“Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China”) is accurate and natural, using “Mainland China” as the standard term for the People’s Republic of China. It is grammatically correct and culturally appropriate.\n- **Translation 3** (“Table 3 Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China”) is similar to Translation 2 but omits the colon after “Table 3,” which is less formal and less commonly used in academic or professional contexts.\n- **Translation 4** (“Mainland China’s related loan growth (as shown in Table 3).”) reorders the information and uses a parenthetical phrase, which is not ideal for a table title. It also uses the possessive form “Mainland China’s,” which is less standard in this context.\n- **Translation 5** (“Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in the Mainland”) uses “the Mainland,” which is less precise than “Mainland China.” It may be interpreted as referring to a different region, such as the mainland of another country.\n- **Translation 6** (“Table 3: Domestic Loan Growth”) is overly brief and omits the key term “related,” which is essential to the meaning of the original text. It may mislead readers by implying that all domestic loans are being discussed, rather than just those that are related to a specific context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nBased on the above analysis, the best translation would be: **“Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China.”** This version is grammatically correct, uses standard terminology, and accurately reflects the original Chinese title. It maintains clarity and precision, making it suitable for professional or academic use.\n\n# Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressure\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has extended a loan repayment relief scheme due to the fifth wave of the pandemic and economic uncertainty. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision.\nStrengths include the consistent use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the accurate mention of the \"pre-approved interest-only\" or \"principal repayment deferral\" schemes. The inclusion of \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" is also accurate, though some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Loan Coordination Mechanism for the Banking Sector\" or \"SME Financing Coordination Mechanism.\"\nWeaknesses include inconsistent terminology for the relief scheme. Some translations use \"Pre-approved Interest-only Repayment,\" while others use \"Principal Payment Holiday Scheme\" or \"Pre-approved Principal Repayment Deferral.\" The original text refers to \"預先批核還息不還本\" which translates most accurately to \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" or \"pre-approved interest-only loan scheme.\" The term \"Principal Payment Holiday Scheme\" is not directly supported by the original text and may mislead readers.\nAdditionally, some translations use \"has extended\" and \"has introduced\" in a way that may imply ongoing actions rather than completed ones. The original text uses \"延長\" (extended) and \"推出及其後優化\" (introduced and later optimized), which are best rendered in past tense for clarity and accuracy.\nCultural and contextual appropriateness is generally maintained, though \"return to normal repayment schedules\" in one translation is slightly more formal than necessary. The phrase \"prepare for resuming normal repayments\" is more natural and commonly used in financial contexts.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use consistent and accurate terminology for the relief scheme, such as \"pre-approved interest-only repayment.\"\n- Ensure past tense is used for completed actions (e.g., \"extended,\" \"introduced,\" \"optimized\").\n- Maintain clarity and natural phrasing, avoiding overly formal or ambiguous expressions.\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nTaking into account the impact of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the continued complex and volatile outlook for both external and local economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" has extended the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme until the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme introduced and later optimized certain principal repayment options to help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks had approved over 108,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures for corporate clients, involving amounts exceeding HKD 1.1 trillion. For individual clients, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only payments (without principal repayment) and other personal emergency loans, involving amounts exceeding HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Real Estate Mortgage Loan  \nProperty Mortgage Loan  \n# Property Mortgage Loan  \nProperty Mortgage Loan  \nProperty Mortgage Loan  \nMortgage Loan for Property  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original term is “物業按揭貸款,” which translates to a loan secured by real estate. The junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the general meaning. However, there are nuances and stylistic considerations that can be improved.\n1. **\"Real Estate Mortgage Loan\"** is a direct and accurate translation. It uses \"Real Estate,\" which is a common term in financial contexts. However, it may be slightly more formal or technical than necessary for general use.\n2. **\"Property Mortgage Loan\"** is also accurate and more concise. \"Property\" is a more general and commonly used term in everyday English, making it more accessible and natural-sounding.\n3. **\"Property Mortgage Loan\"** (repeated by the third, fourth, and fifth translators) is the most consistent and natural-sounding translation. It is concise, clear, and widely understood in financial and legal contexts.\n4. **\"Mortgage Loan for Property\"** is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. It places the focus on the loan being \"for property,\" which is less idiomatic than \"Property Mortgage Loan.\"\nThe most natural and widely accepted translation in English financial terminology is **\"Property Mortgage Loan.\"** It is concise, clear, and aligns with standard usage in the industry. The use of \"Property\" is more common in everyday English than \"Real Estate\" in this context, and it avoids the awkward phrasing of \"Mortgage Loan for Property.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nProperty Mortgage Loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened banks' risk management and enhanced the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly approved residential mortgages was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt-to-income ratio for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, standing at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to proper terminology and structure. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"stress tests\" and \"basis points.\" However, it uses \"mortgage-related risks\" which is slightly less precise than \"mortgage businesses' risks.\"\n**Translation 2** is very close to the best version, with correct terminology and structure. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently and accurately, and the phrasing \"trend of mortgage interest rates relative to their historical long-term average\" is precise.\n**Translation 3** is also accurate, but the phrase \"had taken into account\" is slightly awkward compared to \"took into account\" or \"considered.\" It also uses \"the risks of banks' mortgage businesses,\" which is acceptable but slightly less natural than \"risks in banks' mortgage businesses.\"\n**Translation 4** contains a minor error: \"will reduce\" should be \"reduced\" to match the original text's past tense. The rest of the translation is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n**Translation 5** contains a significant error: it refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is incorrect. This is a critical error in terms of accuracy and institutional reference.\n**Translation 6** is very strong, with correct terminology, proper structure, and natural phrasing. It uses \"the banking sector's mortgage business\" which is slightly broader than the original, but still accurate.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct institutional name (HKMA), precise terminology, and natural phrasing. It should also maintain the original tense and avoid unnecessary wordiness. Based on the above analysis, the best version would combine the strengths of translations 2 and 6, ensuring correct terminology, natural phrasing, and accurate tense.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reduced the assumed increase in mortgage interest rates for the property mortgage loan stress test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points. This decision took into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend of mortgage interest rates compared to their historical long-term average. The HKMA believes this level is sufficient to ensure that risks in banks' mortgage businesses are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgages\n\n# Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has implemented a range of measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include the release in May of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the Regulatory Policy Manual, which outlines the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions are expected to maintain to ensure operational resilience. The HKMA also organized two industry dialogues to enhance the industry's understanding of the new standards and to facilitate the exchange of experiences within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) provision of detailed regulatory guidance on various aspects of banking operations, including specific areas such as customer data protection, payment systems, cloud computing, payment card security, and DDoS attack defense.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" which is acceptable, though \"HKMA\" is more specific and commonly used in official contexts. The term \"distributed denial-of-service attacks\" is correctly spelled out, though \"DDoS\" is often used in technical contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"HKMA\" and \"banking operations,\" which is slightly more precise than \"bank operations.\" It also includes the acronym \"DDoS\" in parentheses, which is helpful for clarity. The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, but uses \"bank operations\" instead of \"banking operations.\" The term \"banking operations\" is more standard in regulatory contexts. The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is incorrect. The correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA.\" The term \"has also provided\" is slightly less natural than \"also provides\" in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the second and is accurate. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"banking operations,\" and includes the acronym \"DDoS\" in parentheses. It is a strong translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"has further provided,\" which is slightly more formal and less direct than \"also provides.\" It also uses \"payment system operation\" (singular) instead of \"payment system operations\" (plural), which is slightly off. The phrase \"distributed denial-of-service attack defense mechanisms\" is a bit awkward compared to \"defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service attacks.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct and commonly accepted name for the authority, which is \"HKMA.\" It should use \"banking operations\" rather than \"bank operations\" for consistency with regulatory terminology. The term \"DDoS\" should be included in parentheses for clarity. The verb tense should be present tense (\"provides\") to reflect ongoing regulatory activity. The phrase \"defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service attacks\" is more natural than \"distributed denial-of-service attack defense mechanisms.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA also provides detailed regulatory guidelines on specific aspects of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIn response to the ever-evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is striving to enhance the cyber defence capabilities of the banking system by promoting the adoption of robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the significant increase in risks posed by phishing scams and other online frauds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September with the theme \"Digital KEY, watch out! Think twice before clicking the LINK!\" to raise public awareness. In July, they also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to brief banks on the latest fraudulent tactics employed by criminals.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign themed \"Keep an eye on your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue – \"Embarking on a Journey Toward Operational Stability\"\nThe original Chinese phrase is “圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」,” which translates to “Figure 1: Industry Dialogue 'Journey Toward Operational Stability'” or similar variations. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and tone.\nThe first translation uses \"Journey Towards Operational Stability\" with a lowercase \"t\" in \"towards.\" While this is grammatically acceptable, it is less common in formal or professional contexts, where \"toward\" is often capitalized when used as a preposition in titles.\nThe second translation is nearly identical to the first, but with \"toward\" capitalized, which is more appropriate in a title.\nThe third translation uses \"Embarking on a Journey to Stable Operations.\" While this is a fluent and natural phrasing, it slightly alters the original meaning by changing \"operational stability\" to \"stable operations,\" which is a subtle but meaningful shift in emphasis.\nThe fourth translation is very close to the second, with the only difference being the inclusion of the article \"A\" before \"Journey.\" This is not necessary in a title and may be considered less concise.\nThe fifth translation uses \"Embarking on a Journey Towards Stable Operations,\" which is similar to the third but with \"towards\" instead of \"to.\" Again, this is a natural phrasing but slightly diverges from the original.\nThe sixth translation uses \"Operational Resilience\" instead of \"Operational Stability.\" While \"resilience\" is a related concept, it is not a direct synonym for \"stability\" and may mislead the reader about the intended meaning.\nConsidering these observations, the best approach is to maintain the original structure and wording as closely as possible while ensuring that the English is fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate. The phrase \"Journey Toward Operational Stability\" is the most accurate and natural rendering of the original Chinese, and capitalizing \"Toward\" is appropriate in a title. The use of an em dash (–) or quotation marks can be used to set off the subtitle, depending on stylistic preference. The phrase \"Embarking on\" adds a more dynamic and engaging tone, which may be preferable in a professional or marketing context. Therefore, the best possible translation would be: \"Figure 1: Industry Dialogue – 'Embarking on a Journey Toward Operational Stability'.\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA is conducting reviews to assess whether authorized institutions have adequate liquidity risk management frameworks, with a focus on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls for group-wide liquidity risk management. Additionally, the HKMA is carrying out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of authorized institutions' market risk management frameworks and control measures for treasury operations.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe original title, \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位,\" is a heading that introduces a topic about Hong Kong's role in global finance. The translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar, with only minor differences in punctuation and spelling.\nThe first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Center\" with a capital \"C,\" which is appropriate for a proper noun in a title. The second translation omits the hash symbol (#), which may be acceptable depending on the context, but it's worth noting that the original includes it. The third translation uses \"Centre,\" which is the British English spelling, while the sixth translation uses lowercase \"status\" and \"center,\" which may be less formal.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct. However, the use of \"Centre\" versus \"Center\" depends on the target audience and regional preferences. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is commonly used in Hong Kong and Taiwan, it may be more appropriate to use the British English spelling \"Centre\" if the target audience is primarily in the UK or Commonwealth countries. However, in the context of global finance, \"Center\" is more commonly used in American English, which is widely understood internationally.\nCulturally, the title is neutral and factual, so there is no need for significant adaptation. However, the use of a hash symbol (#) in the original may indicate that this is a section heading or part of a larger document, which should be preserved in the translation if it's part of a formatting convention.\nConsidering these factors, the best possible translation would be to retain the hash symbol, use \"Center\" for consistency with international financial terminology, and ensure that the title is capitalized appropriately as a heading. The lowercase \"status\" in the sixth translation is less formal and may not be suitable for a title. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be:\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in 2022 to enhance Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial center, using a multifaceted or multi-pronged approach. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, word choice, and structure.\nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning, but the phrase \"pursuing a multifaceted approach\" is placed at the end, which slightly disrupts the flow. It also uses \"position\" instead of \"status,\" which is slightly less common in this context.\nTranslation 2 is concise and clear, but it omits the detail about the \"multi-pronged approach,\" which is an important nuance in the original text.\nTranslation 3 is very close to the ideal version, using \"multi-pronged approach\" and placing the year correctly. However, it uses \"financial centre\" with a British spelling, which may be inconsistent with the target audience's preference for American English.\nTranslation 4 is similar to 3, but it uses \"status\" instead of \"position\" and \"financial center\" with an American spelling. It also includes \"multi-pronged approach,\" which is a strong choice.\nTranslation 5 introduces \"took multiple measures\" instead of \"multi-pronged approach,\" which is a valid interpretation but slightly less idiomatic. It also uses \"internationally competitive financial center\" instead of \"globally competitive international financial center,\" which is a minor but notable difference in phrasing.\nTranslation 6 is well-structured, with \"adopted a multi-pronged approach\" and \"achieving significant progress\" being natural and fluent. It also uses \"globally competitive international financial center,\" which is the most accurate reflection of the original.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would retain the structure of Translation 6, use \"status\" as in Translation 4, and ensure consistent spelling (American English). It should also maintain the nuance of the original by emphasizing the multi-pronged approach and the year 2022.\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopted a multi-pronged approach, achieving significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial center.\n\nThe original Chinese text highlights the successful hosting of the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" emphasizing its impact on Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and the positive ripple effects it generated. The junior translators have all captured the core message, but there are variations in phrasing, grammar, and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the event name, the number of participants, and the key outcomes.\n- The use of terms like \"reinforce,\" \"solidify,\" \"consolidate,\" and \"reinforce\" effectively conveys the strengthening of Hong Kong's financial status.\n- The phrase \"positive ripple effect\" is consistently used, which is an appropriate metaphor for the broader economic or reputational impact.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Structure:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"not only reinforcing... but also generating...\" without a comma, which can disrupt readability.\n- **Event Name Quotation:** The use of quotation marks around the event name is inconsistent. Some translations include them, others do not, which may affect formality or clarity.\n- **Verb Tense and Voice:** The first junior translator uses \"was a resounding success,\" which is more vivid than the passive \"was successfully held\" used by others. However, the latter is more neutral and formal, which may be preferable in a news or official context.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Generated\" and \"created\" are both acceptable, but \"generated\" may sound more technical, while \"created\" is more general. \"Consolidating\" is slightly more formal than \"reinforce\" or \"solidify.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a more formal and consistent structure, such as \"The International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions.\"\n- Ensure proper punctuation, especially with the \"not only... but also...\" construction.\n- Maintain consistency in the use of quotation marks around the event name.\n- Choose a verb that is both formal and precise, such as \"reinforce\" or \"consolidate,\" depending on the desired tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. This not only reinforced Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center but also generated a positive ripple effect.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB hub, across multiple areas. These include optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements, ensuring sufficient RMB liquidity to support the further development of offshore RMB products and markets. Jointly with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the HKMA announced the launch of \"Swap Connect.\" In collaboration with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), a dual-counterparty mechanism was introduced to promote the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, the HKMA launched a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for mainland capital entering international markets and for international investors investing in the rapidly growing mainland market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its role in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform.\n- The key areas covered—bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance—are consistently and accurately translated.\n- The intent to promote Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders is well captured in all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"robust financial system\" and \"opportunities\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Adjectives:** Some translations use \"significant progress\" (e.g., translations 1 and 4), while others use \"good progress\" (e.g., translations 2, 3, 5, 6). The original Chinese uses \"良好進展,\" which is more neutral and closer to \"good progress\" than \"significant progress.\"\n- **Verb Choice:** \"Intensified its market promotion efforts\" (translation 1) and \"intensified its marketing efforts\" (translation 2) are slightly different in tone. \"Market promotion\" is more formal and aligns better with the context of a regulatory authority.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Sound financial system\" (translation 4) and \"stable financial system\" (translation 6) are both acceptable, but \"robust financial system\" (used in translations 1, 2, 5) is more commonly used in financial contexts and better reflects the original's tone.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"helping them understand\" (translations 2, 5), while others use \"raising awareness\" (translation 1) or \"helping them recognize\" (translation 6). \"Helping them understand\" is more natural and direct in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"good progress\" to align with the original's neutral tone.\n- Use \"market promotion efforts\" to reflect the formal and strategic nature of the HKMA's work.\n- Use \"robust financial system\" as it is the most natural and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n- Use \"helping them understand\" for clarity and fluency.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would integrate the most natural and accurate phrasing from the various versions, ensuring fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts towards overseas and mainland stakeholders, helping them understand Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it brings.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, promoting broader adoption of financial technology across the industry to further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional FinTech hub. The fast payment system \"FPS\" continues to grow steadily, with the number of registered users exceeding 10 million by March, and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million by September.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing involvement in international and regional central banking and regulatory organizations, emphasizing its role in global financial stability and market development. The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with slight variations in terminology and phrasing.\nThe first translation uses \"HKMA\" and \"central banks and regulatory organizations,\" which is accurate but slightly less formal than the full name. The second translation uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"central bank and regulatory organizations,\" which is more precise but slightly wordy. The third translation uses \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" and \"global initiatives,\" which is slightly more formal but still accurate. The fourth translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could be confusing. The fifth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the organization in question. The sixth translation uses \"central banking and regulatory forums,\" which is a slight deviation from the original text and may not fully capture the intended meaning.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to use the correct and full name of the organization, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" to avoid confusion. The phrase \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" is more accurate than \"central banking and regulatory forums.\" The use of \"global efforts\" is appropriate, but \"global initiatives\" may be slightly more formal. The phrase \"aimed at maintaining financial stability and promoting market development\" is slightly more precise than \"in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations, contributing to global initiatives aimed at maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English rendition.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its role in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n- The event name, \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" is consistently translated, and the reference to the Financial Secretary's 2022-23 Budget is accurately rendered.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations capturing the key details: the three-day event, the gathering of industry leaders, the focus on opportunities amid uncertainties, and the positive reception of the event.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Implementing the plan\" vs. \"Implementing the initiatives\":** The original Chinese uses the term \"落實\" (implement), which is more accurately translated as \"implementing the initiatives\" rather than \"plan,\" as the Budget likely includes multiple initiatives.\n- **\"Heavyweight guests\" vs. \"High-profile guests\":** While both are acceptable, \"high-profile guests\" is more commonly used in formal contexts and is more neutral.\n- **\"Financial centre\" vs. \"financial center\":** The British spelling \"centre\" is used in some translations, but \"center\" is more common in American English. Since the context is international, either is acceptable, but consistency is key.\n- **\"Budget Address\" vs. \"Budget\":** One translation incorrectly refers to the \"Budget Address,\" which is not a standard term. The correct term is simply \"Budget.\"\n- **\" Garnered a significant response\" vs. \"Received significant attention\":** \"Received significant attention\" is more natural and commonly used in formal writing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"initiatives\" instead of \"plan\" to better reflect the multifaceted nature of the Budget.\n- Use \"high-profile guests\" for consistency and formality.\n- Maintain \"financial center\" for consistency with the majority of translations.\n- Avoid the term \"Budget Address\" and use \"Budget\" instead.\n- Use \"received significant attention\" or \"received an enthusiastic response\" for a more natural tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA hosted the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" implementing the initiatives announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial industry to share their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amidst various uncertainties. The event received significant attention, attracting over 200 high-profile guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the global financial community's support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further consolidated its position as an offshore RMB hub, with offshore RMB business showing steady growth this year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between the mainland and international financial markets. The interconnectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland are widely recognized as the preferred channels for international investors to access the onshore capital market and for mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, the \"Northbound\" leg of the Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the total transaction volume of overseas investors in the China interbank bond market. Since their launch in 2021, the \"Southbound\" leg of the Bond Connect and the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect have operated smoothly. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of the \"Swap Connect,\" further expanding Hong Kong's financial cooperation with the mainland into the derivatives market and reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management center. In July, the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized, marking another significant milestone in strengthening Hong Kong's role as the offshore RMB business hub.\n\nTo offer a more diverse range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in Hong Kong's stock market. The working group has commenced preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual-counter market maker mechanism, to optimize the trading mechanism for stocks traded in both Hong Kong dollars and RMB.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its role in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform.\n- The key initiatives—improving the tax and regulatory environment, promoting innovation in the bond market, and strengthening Hong Kong's position as a green and sustainable finance hub—are accurately reflected.\n- The use of terms like \"preferred fund management center,\" \"green and sustainable finance,\" and \"market promotion\" is consistent with the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive phrasing, such as \"strive to enhance\" or \"has made significant progress,\" which can be rephrased for greater variety and impact.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The term \"convenient\" in translations 2 and 6 is less precise than \"favorable\" or \"facilitative,\" which better capture the intended meaning of a more supportive regulatory environment.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"Mainland China\" in translation 5 is more precise than \"the mainland\" in others, though both are acceptable.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"the Authority\" while others use \"the HKMA.\" A consistent approach is preferable for clarity and professionalism.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the language should be fluent, varied, and precise. The tone should reflect the formal and professional nature of the HKMA's work. The use of terms like \"facilitative\" or \"favorable\" is more appropriate than \"convenient.\" Additionally, the structure should be clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) remains committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management center, the HKMA is working closely with the Government and the financial industry to create a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in the Hong Kong bond market and in consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA has strengthened its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Fintech Facilitation Office’s ongoing efforts to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy and promote the adoption of financial technology in Hong Kong. However, there are notable differences in terms of fluency, terminology consistency, and cultural appropriateness.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate rendering of key terms such as \"Fintech 2025,\" \"central bank digital currency (CBDC),\" and \"cross-border payments.\" Most translations also maintain the structure of the original text, listing the key initiatives in bullet points. However, weaknesses include inconsistent use of terms like \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" (some use \"Fintech Promotion Office\"), \"compliance technology\" (some use \"RegTech\"), and the names of specific initiatives like \"Commercial Data Gateway\" or \"Commercial Data Pass,\" which are not standardized in the original text.\nAdditionally, some translations use \"Fast Payment System 'Faster Payment System' (FPS)\" or \"Overseas PayNow,\" which are either redundant or incorrect. \"FPS\" is the correct acronym for the system, and \"Overseas PayNow\" is not an official name. The term \"Commercial Data Pass\" or \"Commercial Data Exchange\" also lacks clarity and may not be the official name of the initiative.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is essential to ensure consistency in terminology, use the official names of initiatives where available, and maintain a natural, fluent tone in English. The translation should also reflect the formal and professional tone of the original text, as it is likely intended for official or public policy communication.\nBased on this review, the improved translation should use \"Fintech Facilitation Office,\" \"RegTech\" where appropriate, and the correct name of the fast payment system as \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System). It should also use the most accurate and consistent terminology for the initiatives, such as \"Commercial Data Gateway\" or \"Commercial Data Connect\" if that is the official name, or use a more neutral term if the exact name is unclear.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with various banking departments to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a leading fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives launched this year include:\n- Promoting the application of RegTech and conducting fintech application assessments;\n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the wholesale level, aiming to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail-level CBDC in Hong Kong (i.e., \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD);\n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Gateway\";\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging policy support to foster the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting wider use of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and cultural context. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the importance of financial infrastructure to Hong Kong's status as a financial center.\n- Most accurately translate the key terms such as \"RTGS systems,\" \"CMU,\" and \"Bond Connect.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** Some translations use incorrect or inconsistent names for institutions. For example, \"Central Moneymarkets Unit\" (Translation 2) and \"Central Maturity Unit\" (Translation 6) are incorrect; the correct term is \"Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCSS)\" or \"Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU).\" Similarly, \"Hong Kong Trade Data Warehouse\" (Translation 4 and 5) is not the correct name for the institution; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Trade Repository.\"\n- **Numerical Formatting:** Several translations incorrectly format the figures (e.g., \"12,075億港元\" is \"HK$1,207.5 billion,\" not \"HKD 12,075 billion\"). This is a critical error that affects the accuracy of the data.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the settlement services for the Bond Connect 'Northbound Channel' and 'Southbound Channel' remained smooth\" (Translation 5), which is less natural than \"the settlement services for the Bond Connect Northbound and Southbound channels remained smooth.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"foreign exchange fund notes and bonds\" is used in some translations, but the more standard term in financial contexts is \"Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the correct institutional names: \"Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU)\" and \"Hong Kong Trade Repository.\"\n- Ensure numerical accuracy and proper formatting (e.g., \"HK$1,207.5 billion\" and \"HK$1,573.3 billion\").\n- Use natural, fluent English phrasing that aligns with standard financial reporting.\n- Maintain consistency in terminology and avoid unnecessary quotation marks around terms like \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is crucial to maintaining Hong Kong's position as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for the Bond Connect Northbound and Southbound channels remained smooth. By year-end, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds held in the CMU system reached HK$1,207.5 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HK$1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe original text discusses the continued growth of the \"轉數快\" (FPS) system in 2022, highlighting the increase in registered users, daily transaction volume, and the factors contributing to the growth. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the key data points: 11.48 million registered users, 40% increase in daily transaction volume, and the growth drivers.\n- Most translations use \"FPS\" or its English equivalents consistently, which is appropriate for a formal context.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original text's logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Faster Payment System\" or \"Faster Payments\" instead of \"FPS,\" which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. \"FPS\" is the standard abbreviation used in official contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat the name of the system multiple times unnecessarily, which can make the text feel verbose.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** The third and fifth translations have grammatical issues, such as subject-verb agreement errors (\"were the main drivers\" instead of \"was the main driver\").\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** Translating \"轉數快\" as \"Zhuanshu Kuai\" or \"Quick Pay\" is not ideal for an English-speaking audience. It is better to use the established term \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) or \"Fast Transfer\" if the audience is not familiar with FPS.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FPS\" consistently throughout the translation, as it is the standard term used in financial contexts.\n- Avoid repeating the system name unnecessarily; instead, use pronouns or rephrase for clarity.\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement and sentence structure is grammatically correct.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, as the original text is likely from an official or financial report.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe usage of FPS continued to grow in 2022. By the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with the daily average transaction volume increasing by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person and business payments, the increasing use of FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts for stored-value payment tools has been the main driver behind the significant growth in FPS transaction volumes.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to assist the government in the smooth implementation of the consumption voucher scheme by coordinating and facilitating communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the licensed stored value facility operators appointed under the scheme.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) summary of feedback on a discussion paper regarding crypto assets and stablecoins, including the HKMA's responses and its regulatory approach. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to English conventions.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Supervisory Administration (FSA)\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is incorrect. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"consolidating the opinions collected.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"the Authority\" instead of \"HKMA\" in the second sentence, which is slightly less precise. The rest is well-structured.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"compiling the feedback received.\" The sentence structure is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"summarized the feedback received on its discussion paper... issued in January 2023,\" which is slightly awkward in phrasing but still clear.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"crypto-assets\" with a hyphen, which is acceptable but less common in standard usage. The phrase \"outlining the feedback gathered and the HKMA’s responses\" is slightly redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the HKMA.\n- Use natural and fluent English.\n- Avoid redundancy.\n- Maintain clarity and precision in describing the regulatory approach.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn January 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a summary of the feedback received on its discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins, along with the HKMA’s responses. The summary confirms that the HKMA will regulate stablecoins using a risk-based and flexible approach, and outlines the expected scope of regulation, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking matters and plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has served three consecutive terms as Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP). In addition, the HKMA serves as Co-Chair of the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as Co-Chair of the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Furthermore, the HKMA leads the subgroup under the FSB responsible for monitoring progress and follow-up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 國際金融領袖投資峰會,\" which translates to \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" or similar variations. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect the final quality.\nThe first, second, and third translations are identical: \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" This is a direct and accurate translation, but it lacks the possessive form (\"Leaders'\") which is more natural in English when referring to a group of leaders. The fourth translation includes the hashtag \"#\", which is appropriate if the text is intended for social media or online use, but it may be unnecessary in a formal context. The fifth translation, \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit,\" is the most grammatically accurate, as it correctly uses the possessive form to indicate that the leaders are the ones investing. The sixth translation, \"International Finance Leaders Investment Summit,\" uses \"Finance\" instead of \"Financial,\" which is less idiomatic in this context.\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate. The possessive form \"Leaders'\" is more natural in English when referring to a group of individuals acting collectively. Additionally, the use of \"Financial\" is more idiomatic than \"Finance\" in this context. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit.\"\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was held from November 1 to 3.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) hosted the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" in November. The three-day summit received a warm response, bringing together 26 industry leaders to share their unique insights and perspectives on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instabilities, as well as seizing opportunities arising from these challenges. The summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their Group Chairmen or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The participating institutions included some of the world's largest banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe original Chinese text conveys a message about the resumption of normalcy in Hong Kong and the opportunities it presents to global financial leaders. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice, tone, and phrasing that affect the overall quality.\nTranslation 1 uses \"sends\" in the present tense, which is appropriate if the summit is ongoing or has ongoing relevance. However, \"fully recovered\" may be slightly less idiomatic than \"returned to normal.\"\nTranslation 2 uses \"sent\" in the past tense, which may be less appropriate if the summit is still relevant or ongoing. \"Dynamism\" is a strong and appropriate synonym for \"vitality.\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"demonstrating that Hong Kong has returned to normal,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and may be less direct than other versions.\nTranslation 4 uses \"sends\" in the present tense and \"gain insight into,\" which is a slightly more formal and academic phrasing. \"Expanding business\" is a good choice, but \"developing business\" is also acceptable.\nTranslation 5 uses \"returned to normalcy,\" which is a slightly more formal and less commonly used term than \"returned to normal.\" \"Developing Asian business\" is slightly more concise than other versions.\nTranslation 6 uses \"conveyed\" in the past tense, which may be less appropriate if the summit is still relevant. \"Developing Asian business\" is a good choice.\nOverall, the best translation would use the present tense to reflect the ongoing relevance of the summit's message, use \"returned to normal\" as a more natural and commonly used phrase, and use \"developing business in Asia\" as a clear and concise expression of the opportunities Hong Kong offers.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe summit sends a clear message to the global community that Hong Kong has returned to normal; global financial leaders can personally experience Hong Kong's unique resilience and vitality and understand the opportunities Hong Kong offers in developing business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong as the primary gateway to the mainland and a global hub for offshore RMB business.\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global offshore RMB business hub, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. RMB-related activities, including bank deposits, trade settlements, payments, and offshore bond issuances, continued to record steady growth this year. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding interconnected mechanisms. The results of the Bank for International Settlements' triennial survey on foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover, released in 2022, once again confirmed Hong Kong's leading position as an RMB foreign exchange center.\n\nBond Connect's \"Northbound Trading\" continues to serve as the primary channel for international investors to access China's bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily trading volume of Northbound Trading reached RMB 32.2 billion, representing a 25% increase compared to 2021, and accounted for 61% of the total trading volume by overseas investors in China's interbank bond market.\n\nBond Connect’s “Northbound Trading” introduced technical optimization measures in July, including the digitization of the process for investors to participate in the primary market issuance of domestic bonds and a reduction in service fees. These market-oriented improvements have enhanced the operational efficiency of Bond Connect’s “Northbound Trading” and lowered transaction costs for investors.\n\nTo improve the translation of the original Chinese text, it is essential to evaluate the six junior translations for accuracy, fluency, and adherence to English conventions. All translations capture the core message and structure of the original text, but there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms such as \"Bond Connect,\" \"Northbound Trading,\" and \"Swap Connect.\"\n- They all convey the purpose of the initiative: to improve risk management for international investors in the mainland bond market.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is consistent across translations, with only minor variations in abbreviation (e.g., \"HKMA\" vs. \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\").\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"infrastructure institutions\" while others use \"infrastructure institutions in Hong Kong and the mainland.\" The latter is more precise and should be preferred.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use phrases like \"launch of a cross-border connectivity initiative\" or \"commencement of mutual access cooperation,\" which are slightly awkward or redundant. A more natural phrasing would be \"launch of a cross-border connectivity initiative\" or \"initiation of a mutual access cooperation.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"risk management center\" is used in some translations, while others use \"risk management hub.\" \"Hub\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and may be more appropriate.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"launching Northbound trading as soon as possible\" or \"further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market.\" These can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the use of \"mainland China\" versus \"the mainland.\" While both are acceptable, \"the mainland\" is more commonly used in financial and policy contexts in English.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"the mainland\" consistently instead of \"mainland China\" for smoother flow and to align with common financial terminology.\n- Replace \"infrastructure institutions\" with \"infrastructure institutions in Hong Kong and the mainland\" for clarity.\n- Use \"risk management hub\" instead of \"risk management center\" for better alignment with financial jargon.\n- Simplify and streamline phrases such as \"further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market\" to \"further support international investors in the mainland bond market.\"\n- Ensure that the term \"Swap Connect\" is consistently enclosed in quotation marks and introduced with a brief explanation.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from each junior translation, refined for fluency, clarity, and consistency with financial terminology.\n---\nTo enhance the supporting mechanisms for the Bond Connect \"Northbound\" program and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in the mainland bond market, Hong Kong and the mainland announced in July the launch of a collaboration to interconnect their interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will open the Northbound trading channel, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through a connection between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management hub. Preparations for Swap Connect are progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible. The HKMA will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore a more diversified range of risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore China government bond futures, to further support international investors in the mainland bond market.\n\nSince the launch of the Bond Connect \"Southbound\" channel in 2021, the market has responded positively, with smooth operations and transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and denominated in various currencies. The Southbound channel has promoted the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly with a notable increase in the issuance of RMB-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is closely cooperating with relevant mainland authorities to study ways to optimize the Bond Connect Southbound channel, promoting the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the key points: the volatility of the 2022 investment environment, the simultaneous decline in multiple asset classes, the historical significance of the negative returns across stocks, bonds, and non-dollar currencies, and the relative performance of the Exchange Fund compared to other funds.\n- The use of terms like \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" and \"market turmoil\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- Most translations effectively use phrases such as \"diversified long-term asset allocation\" and \"defensive measures and strategic adjustments.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"investment environment\" and \"investment return\" multiple times.\n- **Inconsistent terminology:** Some translations use \"foreign exchange fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is inconsistent with the official name used in the original text.\n- **Awkward phrasing:** Phrases like \"the only year in nearly half a century\" are slightly awkward compared to \"the first time in nearly half a century.\"\n- **Tense and clarity:** Some translations use \"achieved a negative return of -4.5%\" which is redundant (negative return implies a negative number).\n- **Cultural and institutional clarity:** Some translations refer to \"the regulator\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Avoid redundancy by varying sentence structure and using synonyms where appropriate.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency by using natural English phrasing and avoiding literal translations that may sound awkward.\n- Maintain precision in terms of financial terminology and historical context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while addressing the noted weaknesses for clarity, fluency, and precision.\n---\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only challenged the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, but also marked the first time in nearly half a century that stocks, bonds, and major non-dollar currencies all recorded negative returns in the same year. Under such adverse conditions, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses incurred by most multi-asset funds during the year, the Exchange Fund’s performance reflected the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as its defensive positioning and strategic adjustments in response to evolving external circumstances, effectively reducing the impact of the market turmoil.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of the delegated authority by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to formal, institutional language. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is grammatically correct and fluent. However, the use of \"shall determine\" may be too prescriptive for a statement of established objectives. Also, \"seeking investment returns to the extent possible\" is slightly awkward compared to more standard phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses formal language appropriate for an official document. The phrase \"subject to compliance with the above (i) to (iii)\" is slightly wordy, and \"maximize investment returns\" may be more aggressive than the original intent, which is to \"strive to achieve\" returns.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"Protecting capital\" as a gerund is less formal than the infinitive form used in other translations. The phrase \"striving to achieve investment returns as much as possible\" is somewhat redundant and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is one of the strongest translations. It uses the infinitive form consistently, which is appropriate for formal objectives. The phrase \"to seek the highest possible investment returns consistent with the above objectives\" is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation includes the full name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\"), which may be unnecessary unless the full name is required for clarity. The phrase \"preserve monetary and financial stability\" is slightly different from the original, which uses \"maintain.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and formal. However, the use of \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" twice may be redundant, and \"as far as possible\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"as much as possible\" or \"to the extent possible.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be formal, grammatically sound, and use consistent infinitive constructions for the objectives. It should avoid redundancy, use standard financial terminology, and maintain the original intent of the text. The phrase \"safeguard the long-term purchasing power\" is more precise than \"preserve\" or \"maintain.\" Also, the original text uses \"外匯基金\" consistently, so the translation should reflect that with \"Exchange Fund\" rather than \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" unless the full name is required.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) to seek the highest possible investment returns consistent with the above objectives (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a professional or governmental context. It emphasizes that the objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and that these are reflected in the fund's portfolio structure and asset allocation, with a reference to Figure 1.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Comprehensively address\" is a good choice, and the sentence structure is clear. However, \"the Fund’s portfolio framework\" may be slightly less common than \"portfolio structure.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"fully take into account\" is slightly more literal than \"comprehensively address,\" which may not capture the nuance as well. The repetition of \"Exchange Fund\" is unnecessary and could be streamlined.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the second, with the same issues regarding repetition and word choice. \"Comprehensively take into account\" is slightly awkward compared to \"comprehensively address.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of \"foreign exchange fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund\" is inconsistent with the original, which uses the capitalized term. This may be a minor issue, but it could affect consistency in a formal document.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second and third, with the same issues of repetition and word choice.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most concise and natural of the translations. \"Comprehensively consider\" is a good balance between accuracy and fluency. The use of \"its\" instead of repeating \"the Exchange Fund\" improves readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should avoid unnecessary repetition and use vocabulary that is idiomatic in English. \"Comprehensively consider\" is more natural than \"comprehensively take into account\" or \"comprehensively address.\" Also, using \"its\" instead of repeating \"the Exchange Fund\" improves flow. The term \"portfolio structure\" is more commonly used than \"portfolio framework\" in financial contexts. Finally, the original uses \"Exchange Fund\" with a capital \"E,\" which should be preserved for consistency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio\nThe original Chinese text, “圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別,” is a straightforward label for a figure, likely from a financial or economic report. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and consistency.\nThe first translation, “Figure 1: Investment Portfolio Categories of the Exchange Fund,” is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. The phrase “Investment Portfolio Categories” is not the most natural way to express this in English; “Categories of the Investment Portfolio” is more idiomatic.\nThe second through sixth translations all use “Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio,” which is more natural and consistent with standard financial terminology. The use of “Foreign Exchange Fund” is more precise than “Exchange Fund,” as it clearly refers to a fund dealing with foreign exchange. Additionally, the possessive form “Fund’s” is correctly used in all but the fifth translation, which omits the colon after “Figure 1,” making it less formal and less consistent with standard figure labeling conventions.\nThe sixth translation is the most accurate and natural, using the correct possessive form and maintaining proper punctuation. It also uses “Foreign Exchange Fund,” which is the more precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and precision of the sixth translation while ensuring grammatical correctness and natural phrasing. The final translation should be concise, professional, and consistent with standard financial terminology.\n\nThe original text discusses the structure and purpose of the Exchange Fund, emphasizing its division into two portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. Each translation captures the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, fluency, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the two main portfolios and their respective functions.\n- The use of \"OECD\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate.\n- The term \"highly liquid U.S. dollar assets\" is well used to convey the nature of the Support Portfolio's holdings.\n- The goal of the Investment Portfolio—to preserve asset value and purchasing power—is accurately reflected in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"foreign exchange fund\" while others use \"Exchange Fund.\" The latter is more concise and aligns with official terminology used in financial contexts.\n- **\"Monetary base\" vs. \"money supply\":** The original text uses \"貨幣基礎,\" which is best translated as \"monetary base,\" not \"money supply.\" Some translations use \"money supply,\" which is less precise in this context.\n- **\"Currency board system\" vs. \"currency issuance regime\/system\":** The original refers to \"貨幣發行局制度,\" which is best translated as \"currency board system.\" Some translations use \"currency issuance regime\" or \"currency issuance system,\" which are less standard and may confuse readers.\n- **\"Full support\" vs. \"ample backing\" or \"full backing\":** The original uses \"十足支持,\" which is best translated as \"full support\" or \"full backing.\" Some translations use \"ample backing,\" which is less precise.\n- **\"Bond and stock markets\" vs. \"debt and equity markets\":** While both are acceptable, \"bond and stock markets\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and is more reader-friendly.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" for consistency with official terminology.\n- Use \"monetary base\" instead of \"money supply.\"\n- Use \"currency board system\" for \"貨幣發行局制度.\"\n- Use \"full support\" or \"full backing\" for \"十足支持.\"\n- Use \"bond and stock markets\" for clarity and common usage.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member economies, aiming to preserve the value of assets and maintain long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, as well as the allocation for other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a strategy for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe original text discusses the establishment and purpose of the Strategic Asset Portfolio, emphasizing its unique nature and its exclusion from the Exchange Fund's investment performance evaluation. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but it uses \"under the Exchange Fund account\" which is slightly awkward. It also uses \"consistently held\" which is acceptable but not the most natural phrasing.\n**Translation 2** improves on the first by using \"continuously held\" and \"this portfolio is not included,\" which is more natural. However, it still uses \"under the Exchange Fund's account,\" which is not the most precise phrasing.\n**Translation 3** introduces a minor error by using \"Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited\" instead of the correct full name \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\" It also misattributes the purchase to the Exchange Fund rather than the government, which is a critical error in meaning.\n**Translation 4** is confusing due to the awkward phrasing \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes by the government,\" which muddles the relationship between the government and the Exchange Fund.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, using \"consistently held\" and \"its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\" It correctly attributes the purchase to the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.\n**Translation 6** is very close to the best version, with only minor issues such as the unnecessary \"The\" before \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" and the repetition of \"investment performance.\"\nThe best version would retain the clarity and accuracy of Translation 5 while improving the phrasing of the purchase attribution and ensuring the correct full name of the company is used. It should also avoid redundancy in the final sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and clarity. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, the phrase \"the Future Fund is a major individual example\" is awkward and unclear. It seems to imply that the Future Fund is an example of something, but the context is not fully explained.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is more fluent and natural. The use of \"notable exception\" is more appropriate than \"major individual example.\" The phrase \"allocation ratio between the two portfolios\" is slightly redundant, but it is still understandable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"primary individual example\" is slightly awkward, but it is not as problematic as the first version. The phrase \"weighting of the portfolios\" is concise and appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. The use of \"prime example\" is more natural than \"notable exception\" or \"major individual example.\" The phrase \"portfolio weighting\" is concise and appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. The use of \"notable exception\" is appropriate, and the sentence structure is clear. The phrase \"allocation between the two portfolios\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. The use of \"notable exception\" is appropriate, and the phrase \"portfolio's composition\" is slightly less precise than \"portfolio weighting\" or \"allocation ratio.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best translation should use natural, idiomatic English while preserving the meaning and nuance of the original text. The phrase \"Future Fund is a notable exception\" is more natural than \"major individual example\" or \"primary individual example.\" The term \"portfolio weighting\" is more concise and appropriate than \"allocation ratio\" or \"portfolio composition.\" The sentence structure should be clear and direct, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception. The interest rate on deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio weighting. In 2022, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the two types of asset allocation: strategic and tactical.\n- The concept of \"benchmark allocation\" and \"tactical deviation\" is consistently translated, with minor variations in phrasing.\n- The roles of the Financial Secretary and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are accurately reflected in most translations.\n- The overall structure of the text is preserved, and the key financial concepts are clearly communicated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation,\" which is a critical error. The original text clearly refers to \"戰略性偏離\" as \"tactical deviation\" in the context of asset allocation.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"capitalizing on short-term market movements\" versus \"profiting from short-term market fluctuations.\" While both are acceptable, the latter is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Clarity of Roles:** In one translation, the HKMA is said to determine \"strategic asset allocation,\" which is incorrect. The original text states that the HKMA is responsible for determining \"戰略性資產配置\" (tactical asset allocation), not strategic.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as 'tactical deviation'\" in multiple versions, which can be streamlined.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Ensure consistent and accurate terminology, particularly distinguishing between \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" in the context of asset allocation and deviation.\n- Use fluent, natural English that aligns with standard financial terminology.\n- Clarify the roles of the Financial Secretary and the HKMA to avoid misinterpretation.\n- Eliminate redundancy and ensure the text flows smoothly while preserving the original meaning.\n---\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is expressed as an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset mix the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by this strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund seeks to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark through tactical asset allocation. As a result, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and establish the allowable range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 直接投資\". The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, but there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization.\nThe first, second, fifth, and sixth translators used \"Direct Investment\" with a capital \"I\" in \"Investment,\" which is appropriate for a heading or title. The third and sixth translators used \"direct investment\" with lowercase letters, which may be more suitable for a body of text but less appropriate for a heading. The fourth translator included the \"#\" symbol in the translation, which is unnecessary since the symbol is part of the original formatting and not a translation of the word \"直接投資.\"\nThe best translation should maintain the heading format, use proper capitalization, and avoid unnecessary symbols. Therefore, \"Direct Investment\" is the most appropriate translation for the given heading.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and structure. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its Exchange Fund Investment Office as the subject.\n- Most translations accurately convey that the office manages approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio.\n- The use of terms like \"fixed-income market investments\" and \"derivatives\" is consistent with financial terminology.\n- The mention of \"macro risk management strategies\" is well-received and aligns with the original intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error in institutional accuracy.\n- Some translations use \"supporting portfolio\" or \"support portfolio\" without clarifying whether it refers to a specific type of portfolio, which may cause ambiguity.\n- The phrase \"executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies\" is slightly awkward in some translations; \"implements\" or \"carries out\" may be more natural.\n- The use of \"portions of other investment portfolios\" in Translation 3 is unnecessarily wordy and less precise than \"part of the investment portfolio.\"\n- Some translations use \"derivative instruments\" instead of \"derivatives,\" which is technically correct but less concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Ensure the correct institutional name is used: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use consistent and precise terminology, such as \"Exchange Fund Investment Office\" and \"derivatives.\"\n- Clarify terms like \"supporting portfolio\" if necessary, though in this context, it is likely a standard term and does not require further explanation.\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"implements\" or \"carries out\" for \"executes\" in the context of risk management strategies.\n- Maintain a clear and concise structure, avoiding redundancy or overly wordy expressions.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This internally managed portion includes various global fixed-income market investments and implements the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivatives.\n\n# Outsourced Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset categories. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to allow the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and adherence to institutional naming conventions that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: the increasing complexity of the investment environment and the importance of risk management, particularly as implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key terms such as \"risk management,\" \"three-line defense,\" and \"Exchange Fund\" are appropriately used.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Institutional naming:** Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the correct \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" This is a critical issue, as the HKMA is a specific and well-known institution.\n- **Terminology:** The term \"three-line defense\" is more commonly used in risk management contexts than \"three-line defense system\" or \"three-line-of-defense model.\" Consistency in terminology is important for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Redundancy and phrasing:** Some translations use slightly redundant phrasing, such as \"has established strict control measures and investment guidelines... and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring...\" which can be streamlined for better flow.\n- **Nuance in phrasing:** The original uses \"風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架,\" which emphasizes the framework provided by the procedures. Some translations use \"provides a robust framework\" or \"provides a solid basis,\" which are acceptable but could be more precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the correct institutional name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" throughout.\n- Use the standard term \"three-line defense\" without unnecessary modifiers.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and avoid redundancy.\n- Maintain the nuance of the original, particularly in the final sentence, which emphasizes the framework provided by the risk management procedures.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, along with rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA has implemented a three-line defense for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors key investment risk categories, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, and the risk management framework provides a robust foundation for the strategic planning and diversified investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and consistency that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately translate key terms such as \"ESG,\" \"responsible investment,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main ideas are clearly communicated.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and regulatory terminology, which is essential for conveying the message accurately.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" while others use \"Exchange Fund.\" The official term is \"Exchange Fund,\" so consistency is important.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly more verbose or awkward in phrasing. For example, \"the HKMA's Investment Fund\" in Translation 4 is incorrect, as the correct term is \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness:** The use of \"the Authority\" in Translation 6 is acceptable, but \"HKMA\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** Some translations use inconsistent quotation marks (e.g., “Responsible Investment” vs. \"Responsible Investment\") and formatting for the report title.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the official name \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Ensure that \"HKMA\" is used as the primary reference, unless the full name is required for clarity.\n- Maintain consistent punctuation and quotation marks for titles.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, with careful attention to terminology, fluency, and consistency.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to those of other investment options, the HKMA generally prioritizes ESG investments in accordance with its established guiding principles and has integrated ESG factors into the investment management processes of both the Exchange Fund’s public and private markets. Details regarding the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and its implementation can be found in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The original text is a heading: **# 2022 年的金融市場**, which translates to \"2022 Financial Markets\" or \"The Financial Markets in 2022.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, most of which are close to the correct translation but differ in formatting and phrasing.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **\"The Financial Markets in 2022\"** – This is grammatically correct and natural in English. However, it is more verbose than necessary for a heading. It may be better suited for a full article title rather than a section heading.\n2. **\"# Financial Markets in 2022\"** – This is the most accurate and concise translation. It preserves the original formatting with the hashtag and uses a natural, concise phrasing. It is appropriate for a heading or subheading.\n3. **\"## 2022 Financial Markets\"** – The use of \"##\" is not standard in English for headings unless it's for markdown formatting. The phrasing \"2022 Financial Markets\" is correct but slightly less natural than \"Financial Markets in 2022.\"\n4. **\"The Financial Markets in 2022\"** – Same as the first translation. It is correct but verbose for a heading.\n5. **\"# 2022 Financial Market\"** – This is incorrect due to the singular \"Market\" instead of \"Markets.\" Also, the use of the hashtag is appropriate, but the singular form is a grammatical error.\n6. **\"# Financial Markets in 2022\"** – This is the same as the second translation and is the most accurate and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and preserve the original formatting (the hashtag). The phrase \"Financial Markets in 2022\" is more natural and commonly used in English for headings than \"The Financial Markets in 2022.\" Additionally, the use of the hashtag (#) is appropriate if the original text is intended as a section heading or title in a document or online platform.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Financial Markets in 2022\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced abnormal volatility, with bond markets and stock markets respectively declining by 16.2% and 19.8%, representing significant drops.\n\nHit by a surge in global inflation, tight monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock indices plummeted sharply this year. Despite a slight rebound in global stock markets at year-end driven by expectations of inflation peaking and interest rates hitting their peak, the U.S. S&P 500 index still fell by 19.4% for the year, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index dropped 15.5%.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation, leading to rising bond yields, a yield curve inversion, and increased recession concerns.\n- The numerical data (1.63%, 4%, 2008) are consistently and accurately translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice and Tense:** Some translations use \"have been continuously rising\" or \"have continued to surge,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly repetitive. A more varied and natural phrasing would enhance readability.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Surge\" and \"climbed\" are both used, but \"surge\" may be more appropriate for describing a sharp increase in yields, while \"climb\" is more neutral.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use \"with the inversion widening, deepening concerns...\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would improve the flow.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"government bond yields\" is used consistently, but \"Treasury yield curve\" is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use more varied and natural verbs to avoid repetition.\n- Ensure consistency in financial terminology (e.g., \"Treasury yield curve\").\n- Improve sentence flow by using smoother transitions and more natural phrasing.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the language for greater fluency and precision.\n\nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened in 2022, driven by the Federal Reserve's consecutive interest rate hikes. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, experienced substantial depreciation against the dollar, with the British pound and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe original text is a financial report detailing the investment losses of the Exchange Fund in 2022, with specific breakdowns of losses across different asset classes and entities. The translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate in terms of content and numerical data, but they vary in fluency, terminology, and consistency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the main figures and structure of the original text.\n- The use of \"HKD\" or \"HK$\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for denoting Hong Kong dollars.\n- The breakdown of losses into bond, stock, and other investment categories is accurately reflected in all translations.\n- The mention of \"strategic asset portfolio\" and its valuation loss is consistently translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" while others use \"Exchange Fund.\" The original text uses \"外匯基金,\" which is best translated as \"Exchange Fund\" or \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\" However, \"Exchange Fund\" is more commonly used in official contexts in Hong Kong.\n- **\"Equity Investment\" vs. \"Stock Investment\":** Some translations use \"equity investment\" while others use \"stock investment.\" \"Stock investment\" is more precise in this context, as it refers to investments in listed shares.\n- **\"Valuation Adjustment\" vs. \"Valuation Loss\":** The term \"valuation adjustment\" is used in some translations, but the original text refers to a \"估值下調\" (valuation decrease), which is more accurately translated as \"valuation loss\" or \"decrease in valuation.\"\n- **\"Investment Holding Subsidiary\" vs. \"Investment Holding Company\":** The original text refers to \"投資控股附屬公司,\" which is best translated as \"investment holding subsidiaries\" rather than \"investment holding company.\"\n- **Fluency and Readability:** Some translations are more fluent than others. For example, the use of \"which included\" and \"comprising\" can affect the flow of the sentence.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, as it is the standard term in Hong Kong financial contexts.\n- Use \"stock investment\" rather than \"equity investment\" for consistency with the original text.\n- Use \"valuation loss\" or \"decrease in valuation\" for \"估值下調.\"\n- Use \"investment holding subsidiaries\" to accurately reflect the original term.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and avoids redundancy, such as repeating \"loss\" unnecessarily.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment losses of HK$205.4 billion in 2022, including HK$53.2 billion in bond investment losses, HK$80.5 billion in stock investment losses (comprising HK$61 billion in losses from overseas stock investments and HK$19.5 billion in losses from Hong Kong stock investments), a HK$40 billion decrease in the valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HK$31.7 billion in losses from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total value of the Exchange Fund’s assets reached HK$400.8 billion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$484.7 billion, of which private equity accounted for HK$370 billion and real estate for HK$114.7 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$270.8 billion.\n\nThe original text provides financial data on the performance of different investment portfolios managed by the Exchange Fund. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and phrasing.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the key figures: -4.5%, -8.6%, -0.4%, and 12.6%.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original order.\n- The term \"annualized internal rate of return\" is consistently used, which is appropriate in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"strategic asset allocation\" instead of \"strategic asset portfolio,\" which may not be the exact term used in the original. \"Portfolio\" is more consistent with the original Chinese term.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward, such as \"since its investment commencement in 2009\" or \"returning at -8.6%.\" These phrases are grammatically correct but not as natural as alternatives.\n- **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"with the investment portfolio returning -8.6%\" are repeated in multiple translations, which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"strategic asset portfolio\" consistently to match the original.\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"achieved a return of -8.6%\" instead of \"returning -8.6%.\"\n- Simplify expressions like \"since its inception in 2009\" or \"since the start of investments in 2009\" to \"since 2009\" for brevity and fluency.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022, with the investment portfolio achieving a return of -8.6% and the support portfolio achieving a return of -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the investment return rates of the Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment return rates over different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rates were 1.5% from 2020 to 2022, 2.3% from 2018 to 2022, 2.4% from 2013 to 2022, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward reference to the location of audited financial statements in a document. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, formality, and clarity that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, using \"presented on pages 173 to 281.\" However, it uses \"for the year 2022\" which is slightly more formal than necessary for a document reference.\n**Translation 2** uses \"See pages 173 to 281 for...\" which is a direct and concise way to refer to the location of the documents. However, it uses \"foreign exchange fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which may be less consistent with the official name used in the original text.\n**Translation 3** begins with \"Regarding the audited 2022 Annual Financial Statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund, see pages 173 to 281.\" This is grammatically correct and maintains the formal tone of the original. However, the structure is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Translation 4** uses \"can be found on pages 173 to 281,\" which is a common and natural phrasing in English. It is also consistent with the original's use of \"Exchange Fund.\"\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"for the year 2022\" instead of \"2022.\" This is a minor variation in phrasing but does not significantly affect the meaning.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 1 and 5, with the only difference being the use of \"annual\" before \"financial statements.\" This is a more precise term and may be preferable in a formal document.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also use the exact terminology used in the original text, such as \"Exchange Fund\" rather than \"foreign exchange fund.\" Additionally, the phrase \"can be found on pages 173 to 281\" is more natural and commonly used in English than \"are presented on pages 173 to 281.\"\nThe most improved translation would combine the clarity of Translation 4 with the precision of Translation 6, using \"audited 2022 annual financial statements\" and \"can be found on pages 173 to 281.\"\nThe audited 2022 annual financial statements of the Exchange Fund can be found on pages 173 to 281.\n\nFigure 1: Rate of Return on Investment for the Foreign Exchange Fund (1994–2022)\n"}

It also highlights the HKMA's efforts to communicate with the public and markets through various channels.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. However, \"maintaining high transparency and accountability\" could be more natural as \"maintaining high levels of transparency and accountability.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"a high degree of transparency and accountability\" is slightly more formal but still appropriate. The phrase \"wider community and the market\" is slightly awkward compared to \"broader society and markets.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and natural. The use of \"enhance public understanding\" is slightly more active than \"promote,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"financial markets\" is more specific than \"markets,\" which may be more precise depending on context.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very strong. It uses \"while demonstrating\" to link the two clauses, which improves flow. The phrase \"general public and markets\" is natural and concise. However, \"operations\" is repeated, which could be slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is a very accurate and natural translation. It uses \"outstanding efficiency\" and \"broader society and markets,\" which are both appropriate. The repetition of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation contains a critical error: it refers to the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a factual mistake that changes the meaning of the text. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and natural, with appropriate vocabulary and structure. It should avoid redundancy and maintain the correct institutional reference. Based on the above review, the fourth and fifth translations are the strongest, with the fourth being slightly more concise and natural in its phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe functional departments of the institution support the operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), maintaining high transparency and accountability while demonstrating exceptional efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations, the HKMA maintains effective communication with the general public and markets through traditional and social media, websites, information centers, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has meticulously built a team that emphasizes adaptability and sustainable development, while upholding strict fiscal discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional result.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its efforts to maintain media relations.\n- The numerical data (e.g., 112 events, 492 press releases) are consistently and accurately translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the original's informative tone.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"close contact\" or \"close communication,\" while others use \"close ties.\" \"Maintains close communication\" is more formal and appropriate for an official body like the HKMA.\n- **Terminology Consistency:** \"On-site interviews\" and \"site visits\" are used interchangeably, but \"on-site interviews\" is more accurate in the context of media engagement.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"handled daily\" or \"processed a daily basis,\" which are grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"handled daily\" or \"processed daily.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"the HKMA\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the language should be formal yet fluent, with consistent terminology and a natural flow. The use of \"maintains close communication\" is more appropriate than \"close contact\" or \"close ties\" in an official context. \"On-site interviews\" is more precise than \"site visits\" in the context of media engagement. The phrase \"handled daily\" is more idiomatic than \"processed a large number of media inquiries on a daily basis.\" Also, the repetition of \"the HKMA\" can be minimized for smoother reading.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and foster public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the HKMA organized or participated in a total of 112 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 93 other public activities. Additionally, the HKMA arranged 46 media interviews. Throughout the year, 492 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main functions, the HKMA organizes press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as the operations of the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office, green and sustainable finance, and central bank digital currency.\n\nVarious media actively participated in events organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2022, including the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit attracted significant media attention, with over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending for coverage. Approximately 1,000 news articles were published in local, regional, and international media. In addition, the event arranged live streaming for 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively engage with the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) operates six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube), which have attracted over 100,000 followers. In 2022, the HKMA launched a WeChat page to reach a broader audience. The HKMA uses social media to promote major events and initiatives, such as the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and the government's green bond program, and to raise public awareness of various topics, including the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, and fraud prevention.\n\nMr. Stephen Yü, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, was interviewed live by the media at the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\".\nStrengths: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the title and name of the individual, uses appropriate terminology (\"Chief Executive\"), and conveys the event and action clearly. The use of \"live\" effectively captures the immediacy of the interview.\nWeaknesses: The name \"Stephen Yü\" may not be the most commonly used form of the individual's name in official contexts. Additionally, \"live\" is slightly redundant since \"interviewed by the media\" already implies a live event.\nMr. Stephen Lewis, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, was interviewed by the media on the spot at the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\"\nStrengths: The structure is clear and the title is correctly used. \"On the spot\" is a natural expression for an impromptu or on-site interview.\nWeaknesses: The name \"Stephen Lewis\" is incorrect. The individual's name is not \"Stephen Lewis.\" This is a significant error that affects the accuracy of the translation.\nMr. Yu Weimeng, CEO of the Financial Services and Markets Authority, was interviewed by the media at the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\"\nStrengths: The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the event clearly.\nWeaknesses: The name \"Yu Weimeng\" is incorrect. The correct name is \"Yu Wai-man\" or \"Eddie Yue Wai-man.\" Additionally, the title \"CEO of the Financial Services and Markets Authority\" is incorrect. The correct title is \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\nMr. Yu Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, answered media questions on-site at the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\"\nStrengths: The name and title are accurate. The use of \"answered media questions on-site\" is natural and conveys the event clearly.\nWeaknesses: The title \"Governor\" is not the most commonly used title for the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. \"Chief Executive\" is more appropriate.\nMr. Yu Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, was interviewed by the media on-site at the 'International Financial Leaders Investment Summit'.\nStrengths: The name and event are correctly translated. The use of \"on-site\" is appropriate.\nWeaknesses: Similar to the previous translation, \"Governor\" is not the most accurate title for the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. \"Chief Executive\" is more commonly used.\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue Wai-man accepted an impromptu media interview at the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\nStrengths: The name and title are accurate. The use of \"accepted an impromptu media interview\" is natural and conveys the event clearly.\nWeaknesses: The name \"Eddie Yue Wai-man\" is a bit more formal than necessary. \"Eddie\" is not typically used in official contexts. Additionally, the use of \"impromptu\" may be slightly more formal than necessary for the context.\nReasoning: Based on the above review, the best possible translation should use the correct name and title, convey the event clearly, and use natural and appropriate language. The name should be \"Yu Wai-man\" or \"Stephen Yü\" depending on the preferred form. The title should be \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The event should be described clearly and naturally, using terms like \"interviewed by the media\" or \"answered media questions.\"\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Mr. Yu Wai-man was interviewed by the media at the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\n\nMr. Yu Weiwen, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered the opening keynote speech at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022.\"\n\nMr. Kwan Kuk-hung, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, spoke at the \"FinTech Elite Forum 2022,\" a joint event hosted by Cyberport and Accenture.\n\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**金管局副總裁李達志先生主持新聞發布會闡述金管局對於「數碼港元」的政策立場**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurately captures the main elements: the person (Li Da Zhi), the action (chaired a press conference), and the subject (policy stance on \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\").  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Li Da Zhi\" is a transliteration that may not be the most commonly used in English media. Also, \"HKMA\" is used, which is acceptable but not always necessary for clarity.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" is correct, but the use of quotation marks may be better replaced with italics or standard capitalization.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Li Tak-ji\" which is a more common transliteration in English media. The verb \"presided over\" is slightly more formal than \"chaired.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Elaborate on\" is slightly more verbose than necessary. The use of \"regarding\" is acceptable but not the most concise.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" is correct.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Mr. Li Dazhi\" which is a common format.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly refers to the \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, mistakenly translates \"數碼港元\" as \"digital yuan\" (which refers to China's digital currency, not Hong Kong's).  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"digital yuan\" is a critical error in context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Mr. Lee Tak-chee\" which is a common transliteration. Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"chaired\" or \"presided over.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" is correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Mr. Li Dakai\" which is a common transliteration. Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Presided over\" is slightly more formal than necessary. The repetition of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is redundant.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" is correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Mr. Lee Tak-chee\" which is a common transliteration. Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"chaired\" or \"presided over.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" is correct.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use a widely accepted transliteration of the name (e.g., \"Li Tak-ji\" or \"Lee Tak-chee\").\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention, with \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation.\n- Use a neutral and formal verb such as \"chaired\" or \"presided over.\"\n- Correctly use the term \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" without confusion with \"digital yuan.\"\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure clarity and fluency.\n### Improved Translation:\nMr. Li Tak-ji, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired a press conference to explain the HKMA’s policy stance on the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a video address at the 2022 Financial Street Forum Annual Conference.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Public Inquiry Service as an effective channel for public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and accurately report the number of inquiries (9,952) in 2022.\n- The key topics—banking consumer matters, banking policies, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development—are consistently mentioned across all translations.\n- The specific programs mentioned (e.g., Coin Collection Scheme, Retail Bond Issuance Programme) are also consistently translated, though with slight variations in terminology (e.g., \"program\" vs. \"scheme\").\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"handling a total of 9,952 inquiries in 2022\" (repetition of \"a total of\") or \"banking industry policies and regulations\" (which is slightly more verbose than necessary).\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the use of terms like \"program\" vs. \"scheme\" and \"guidelines and notices\" vs. \"guidance and announcements.\" A consistent term should be used throughout the translation for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"HKMA\" is used in some translations, while others use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" For consistency and formality, it is better to use the full name on first mention and the acronym thereafter.\n- **Nuance and Precision:** Some translations use \"a significant number of inquiries\" or \"a larger number of inquiries,\" which are less precise than \"a significant portion\" or \"a majority.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention, followed by the acronym \"HKMA.\"\n- Maintain consistent terminology (e.g., use \"scheme\" or \"program\" consistently, and use \"guidelines and notices\" or \"guidance and announcements\" consistently).\n- Improve fluency by avoiding repetitive phrasing and ensuring that the sentence structure is natural and professional.\n- Ensure that the translation accurately reflects the nuance of the original, particularly in terms of the proportion of inquiries and the specific programs involved.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Public Inquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main functions and operations. In 2022, a total of 9,952 inquiries were handled. Approximately half of these concerned banking consumer matters, banking policies and regulations, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and developments in the bond market. Among these, a significant portion related to the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, guidelines and notices related to the banking industry, and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2019, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe original Chinese text, \"圖1 公眾查詢總數,\" translates to \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, with the primary differences lying in the use of \"Inquiries\" versus \"Queries\" and whether \"Number of\" is included.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate use of \"Figure 1\" as the label and the correct translation of \"公眾\" as \"Public.\" The use of \"Inquiries\" and \"Queries\" both convey the idea of questions or requests made by the public, though \"Inquiries\" is more commonly used in formal or official contexts, which aligns well with the likely context of this figure.\nWeaknesses include the omission of \"Number of\" in some translations, which slightly reduces clarity. While \"Total Public Inquiries\" is grammatically correct and commonly used, including \"Number of\" adds precision and clarity, especially in formal or statistical contexts.\nThe best translation should maintain clarity, formality, and precision. Therefore, \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" is the most accurate and natural translation, as it includes all necessary components for clarity and maintains the formal tone appropriate for such a label.\n\nFigure 2: Breakdown of Inquiries Received in 2022 by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations accurately convey the core information: the HKMA publishes various reports and articles to provide data and analysis on Hong Kong's financial and economic affairs. However, differences in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness are evident.\nThe first translation is clear and concise, but it uses \"Hui Si\" without explanation, which may be unclear to English readers unfamiliar with the term. The second translation is similar but uses \"Hui Si\" without clarification and omits the quotation marks, which may be important for branding. The third translation introduces \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority Insights\" as a translation of \"Hui Si,\" which is a creative but potentially misleading interpretation. The fourth and fifth translations use \"Insight\" as a title for the articles, which is more natural in English and aligns with common journalistic terminology. The sixth translation is the most detailed, providing full titles for the reports and using \"Hong Kong Monetary Policy Insights\" as a translation of \"Hui Si,\" but this may be overly literal and not widely recognized.\nThe best approach would be to maintain clarity and fluency while ensuring that the titles of reports and articles are accurately and appropriately translated. \"Hui Si\" should be translated in a way that reflects its intended meaning—likely \"Insights\" or \"Perspectives\"—and should be presented with quotation marks or italics to denote it as a publication title. The term \"Financial Data Monthly Report\" should be consistently used, and the structure should be clear and professional.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA publishes two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report, and regularly updates the Monthly Financial Data Report, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA has published 17 \"Insight\" articles introducing the HKMA’s key measures and policies and discussing matters of public concern.\n\nThe original text is a concise statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) receiving awards for its 2021 Annual Report. The junior translators have all captured the core information accurately, but there are variations in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA, the year of the report (2021), the awards received (Silver and Excellence\/Merit), and the categories (Non-profit and Charitable Organizations, Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting).\n- The names of the awarding body are consistently translated as either \"Hong Kong Management Association\" or \"Hong Kong Institute of Management,\" which are both acceptable, though \"Hong Kong Institute of Management\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical sequence.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term for the second award varies between \"Excellence Award,\" \"Merit Award,\" and \"Outstanding Award.\" While all are acceptable, \"Merit Award\" is more commonly used in award contexts and is more precise.\n- **Awarding Body Name:** Some translations use \"Hong Kong Management Association,\" while others use \"Hong Kong Institute of Management.\" The latter is more accurate, as the Hong Kong Institute of Management (HKIM) is the official name of the organization.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"received the Silver Award\" while others use \"won the Silver Award.\" Both are correct, but \"won\" is more dynamic and commonly used in award announcements.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations include the word \"category\" twice, which is unnecessary and slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the official name of the awarding body: \"Hong Kong Institute of Management.\"\n- Use \"Merit Award\" for the second award, as it is the most standard term in such contexts.\n- Use \"won\" instead of \"received\" for a more dynamic tone.\n- Avoid redundancy by omitting the second use of \"category\" when it is implied.\n- Ensure consistency in punctuation and quotation marks.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2021 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category and the Merit Award for \"Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting\" in the Hong Kong Institute of Management's 2022 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Organization Website\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) website, detailing the amount and types of information available, as well as the legal basis for certain registers. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and adherence to formal tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the website URL and the number of pages.\n- Most translations accurately convey the availability of English and Chinese (traditional and simplified) content.\n- The legal references (e.g., Banking Ordinance, Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance) are generally well translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"institution\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less precise. Others use \"Authorized Institutions\" or \"Recognized Institutions,\" which may not be the exact legal term used in the original.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward or overly wordy (e.g., \"facilitating public access to the latest updates from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\").\n- **Register of Titles:** Some translations use \"Licensees\" or \"Operators\" instead of \"Operators\" or \"Holders,\" which may not match the exact legal terminology used in the original.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"institution\" instead of \"HKMA\" may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the organization.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure legal terms are accurately translated (e.g., \"Recognized Institutions\" instead of \"Authorized Institutions\").\n- Use precise terms such as \"Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators\" or \"Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Licence Holders\" as appropriate.\n- Improve sentence flow and avoid redundancy (e.g., \"facilitating public access to the latest information\" can be more concise).\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the HKMA. The website also includes the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, precision, and consistency.\nFirstly, the term \"金管局\" is consistently translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in most translations, which is correct. However, the fifth translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is not the official name of the organization and should be corrected.\nSecondly, the phrase \"分階段發放\" is translated in various ways, such as \"progressively,\" \"gradually,\" and \"in phases.\" While all are acceptable, \"in phases\" is the most precise and directly reflects the original Chinese term, which implies a structured, step-by-step release.\nThirdly, the term \"開放API\" is translated as \"open application programming interfaces (open APIs)\" in all translations. This is accurate, but the repetition of \"open\" is redundant. It would be more natural to use \"open application programming interfaces (APIs)\" or simply \"open APIs\" without the redundant explanation.\nFourthly, the phrase \"依照原定計劃\" is translated as \"according to the original plan,\" \"as per the original plan,\" and \"in accordance with the original plan.\" All are correct, but \"as originally planned\" is more concise and natural in English.\nLastly, the use of \"sets of open APIs\" in the third translation is slightly awkward. It would be more natural to say \"a total of 148 open APIs\" without the word \"sets.\"\nTaking these observations into account, the best possible translation would be one that is precise, fluent, and natural in English, while accurately reflecting the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been releasing financial data and important information on its website in phases through open application programming interfaces (APIs) since 2018. By the end of 2022, the HKMA had launched a total of 148 open APIs on its website as originally planned.\n\n# Information Center\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core information of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre on the 55th floor of the International Finance Centre (with slight variations in naming, such as \"Phase 2\" vs. \"Tower 2\" vs. \"Two International Finance Centre\").\n- The structure of the Information Centre as comprising an exhibition hall and a library is consistently maintained.\n- The function of the exhibition hall and library is accurately described, including the interactive methods used and the types of materials available.\n- The legal requirement under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance is mentioned in all translations, though the exact titles of the registers vary slightly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the use of terms such as \"Monetary Authority\" (vs. \"HKMA\"), \"Recognized Institutions\" (vs. \"Authorized Institutions\" vs. \"Licensed Institutions\"), and \"Securities Business Employees\" (vs. \"Securities and Futures Professionals\").\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use more formal or less natural phrasing, such as \"serves as an important facility\" (repetitive) or \"maintains the 'Register of...' for public reference\" (less natural than \"available for public reference\").\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"Two International Finance Centre\" is more common in Hong Kong English, but \"International Finance Centre Phase 2\" is also acceptable and more precise.\n- **Accuracy of Legal References:** Some translations misrepresent the exact titles of the registers, such as \"Register of Securities and Futures Professionals\" instead of \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent and official terminology, such as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Recognized Institutions.\"\n- Ensure natural and fluent English, avoiding repetitive phrasing and using more idiomatic expressions.\n- Accurately reflect the legal terminology as per the Banking Ordinance.\n- Use the most commonly accepted name for the building: \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It serves as an important facility for introducing the HKMA's work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector through interactive methods, and also provides reference materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is the library, which houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" as required by Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, for public reference.\n\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively resumed its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively resumed its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\n\nAfter reviewing the translations, it is evident that all six versions are grammatically correct and convey the core meaning of the original sentence. However, there are subtle differences in vocabulary and phrasing that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nThe first and second translations are nearly identical, using \"brand-new\" and \"reopened to the public in March 2023.\" While this is accurate, \"brand-new\" is slightly informal and may not be the most natural choice in a formal context.\nThe third and fifth translations use \"newly refurbished,\" which is a more formal and commonly used term in English when describing renovated buildings. This choice enhances the sentence's professionalism and clarity.\nThe fourth translation uses \"newly renovated,\" which is also appropriate but slightly less common than \"refurbished\" in the context of public buildings like libraries.\nThe sixth translation omits the hyphen in \"brand new,\" which is grammatically acceptable but less preferred in formal writing compared to \"brand-new.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"newly refurbished\" for its formality and clarity, and \"reopened to the public\" for its natural phrasing. Additionally, using \"Following renovations\" instead of \"After renovation\" adds a slightly more formal tone, which is suitable for describing a public institution like a library.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nFollowing renovations, the newly refurbished library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 社區聯繫及公眾教育,\" which translates to a heading or title. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, with slight variations in wording. The most common translation is \"Community Engagement and Public Education,\" which is both accurate and natural in English. \n\"Community Engagement\" is a widely used term in English that conveys active participation and interaction within a community, which aligns well with \"社區聯繫\" (community contact\/links). \"Public Education\" is a direct and appropriate translation of \"公眾教育\" (public education). \nOne alternative translation, \"Community Contact and Public Education,\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"Community Engagement\" in this context. \"Community Contact\" is more literal and less commonly used in formal or professional settings compared to \"Community Engagement.\"\nGiven the context and the need for a natural, professional-sounding heading, \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" is the most suitable translation. It is concise, accurate, and widely understood in English-speaking contexts.\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held online seminars that attracted over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The seminars covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's functions, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, safeguarding personal digital keys, the deposit protection scheme, and opportunities in the banking industry. To date, the public education seminars have attracted more than 65,000 participants.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and cultural appropriateness that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey its role in educating the public about financial services.\n- The term \"phishing scams\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and widely understood in English.\n- The translations all include the key elements: cross-media campaigns, warnings about fake links, and tips on financial products like credit cards and \"buy now, pay later\" options.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is a critical error in institutional naming.\n- Some translations use \"savvy\" or \"smart\" interchangeably, but \"prudent\" and \"responsible\" are more formal and appropriate for an official body like the HKMA.\n- The phrase \"remind them how to be...\" is slightly awkward in some translations; \"remind them to be...\" is more natural.\n- The use of \"citizens\" in some translations may be less neutral than \"the public\" or \"people.\"\n- The structure of the sentence regarding the cross-media campaign varies slightly, with some translations using \"to further alert the public to be vigilant against...\" which is slightly more fluent than \"to further remind the public to be cautious of...\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"prudent and responsible\" consistently for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure the correct name of the authority is used throughout.\n- Use \"the public\" or \"people\" instead of \"citizens\" for neutrality.\n- Use \"remind them to be\" instead of \"remind them how to be\" for better fluency.\n- Ensure parallel structure in describing the campaigns and their purposes.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates and engages the public, reminding them to be prudent and responsible users of financial services. In light of the increasing number of phishing scams, the HKMA has launched a cross-media publicity campaign to further alert the public to be vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks contained in SMS messages and emails purportedly sent by banks, and to be cautious of other types of scams involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA has also organized radio and social media campaigns to provide tips on the prudent use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods, including \"buy now, pay later\" products.\n\nA new short video titled \"Keep an eye on your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!\"  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, “以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為題的全新短片,” is a concise and catchy phrase that conveys a warning about digital security. The key elements to capture are:  \n- The use of “數碼KEY” (digital key), which is likely a play on words or a brand name.  \n- “睇緊啲” (watch out \/ keep an eye on), which is colloquial and informal.  \n- “撳LINK前要三思” (think twice\/thrice before clicking the link), which is a call to caution.  \n- The overall tone is urgent and advisory, likely aimed at a general audience, possibly in a cybersecurity or digital safety context.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"A new short video titled 'Keep an eye on your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and natural phrasing. The use of “keep an eye on” captures the colloquial tone of “睇緊啲.”  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Think twice” is slightly less direct than “三思” (think thrice), but it is commonly used in English for similar warnings.  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"A new short film titled 'Digital KEY: Look Carefully, Think Thrice Before Pressing the Link!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “Think Thrice” to match the original’s “三思.”  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Look Carefully” is less idiomatic than “keep an eye on.” Also, “short film” may be misleading if the content is more of a video or advertisement.  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"A new short video titled 'Be careful with digital keys, think twice before clicking links!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Natural and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Be careful with digital keys” is slightly more general than the original, which uses “睇緊啲” (watch out).  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"New video with the title 'Digital KEY is watching you closely! Think twice before pressing LINK!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Creative and engaging.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Digital KEY is watching you closely” is a personification that may not align with the original’s more direct tone. Also, “LINK” in all caps is unnecessary.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"New short video titled 'Digital KEY is watching closely! Think thrice before clicking the LINK!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “Think thrice” to match the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Digital KEY is watching closely” is personified and may not be the best fit for the original’s tone.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"A new short film titled 'Digital KEY: Watch Out, Think Twice Before Pressing the LINK!'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “Watch Out” to match the original’s “睇緊啲.”  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Short film” may be misleading, and “LINK” in all caps is unnecessary.  \n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**  \nThe best translation should:  \n- Use “Keep an eye on your digital key” to capture the informal and watchful tone of “睇緊啲.”  \n- Use “think twice” as it is a common and natural expression in English, though “think thrice” is also acceptable.  \n- Avoid unnecessary capitalization of “LINK.”  \n- Use “short video” rather than “short film” to better reflect the likely format.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nA new short video titled \"Keep an eye on your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!\"\n\nTo assist citizens in keeping up with the times and staying informed about the development of financial technology services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been promoting the use of electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year through social media and radio. The HKMA has produced an animated short film explaining open APIs and introducing important considerations when using mobile applications from third-party service providers (such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies) to access banking services. The animated short film also introduces the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment features and benefits of the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS).\n\nAnimated short films help enhance the public's understanding of digital finance.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**動畫短片有助增進公眾的數碼金融知識**  \nwhich translates to:  \n\"Animated short films help enhance the public's digital financial knowledge.\"\nThe six junior translations all capture the core meaning of the sentence, but they vary in terms of fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision.\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"digital financial knowledge\" – this is accurate but slightly less natural than \"digital finance\" in English, which is a more commonly used term in financial contexts.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"digital financial literacy\" – while \"literacy\" is a strong term, it implies a broader set of skills (e.g., the ability to use financial tools, understand financial products, etc.), which may be more than what the original text intends. The original uses \"知識\" (knowledge), which is more about awareness or information rather than comprehensive literacy.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"public understanding\" – this is a good choice, as it conveys the idea of making the public more aware or informed. However, \"animated shorts\" is slightly informal compared to \"animated short films.\"\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"public's understanding of digital finance\" – this is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"understanding\" instead of \"knowledge,\" which is more natural in this context, and \"digital finance\" is a standard term.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"knowledge of digital finance\" – this is accurate but slightly less natural than \"understanding\" in this context.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"public knowledge of digital finance\" – the phrasing \"public knowledge\" is slightly awkward and less idiomatic than \"the public's understanding.\"\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy with natural English phrasing. \"Understanding\" is more idiomatic than \"knowledge\" in this context, and \"digital finance\" is a standard term. \"Animated short films\" is more formal and precise than \"animated shorts.\" Therefore, the best translation would be:\n**\"Animated short films help enhance the public's understanding of digital finance.\"**\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to increase public awareness of the financial industry and encourage young people to pursue careers in the sector. It highlights the use of a new interview video featuring graduates of the HKMA's Trainee Manager Programme, who share their experiences to attract potential applicants and enhance their understanding of the HKMA's work.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"fostering interest\" and \"increasing their understanding,\" which are natural expressions. The term \"Trainee Manager Programme\" is correctly used, and the structure is clear.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"fostering interest among young people\" and \"enhancing their understanding of working at the HKMA.\" However, \"Management Trainee Programme\" may not be the exact name used in the original, which could be a minor issue.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in meaning and tone. It uses \"fostering interest among young people in joining the HKMA and the sector as a whole,\" which is slightly more elaborate but still natural. The use of \"video interviews\" is slightly different from the original's \"訪問短片\" (interview short film), but it's not a major issue.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"HKMA Internship Programme\" instead of \"Trainee Manager Programme,\" which may not be accurate. It also uses \"increasing the interest of the younger generation,\" which is slightly less natural than \"fostering interest.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"encouraging the younger generation to join HKMA or the financial sector\" and \"firsthand experiences,\" which are appropriate. The structure is clear and the language is fluent.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate but slightly more formal. It uses \"strives to deepen the public's understanding\" and \"boost the interest of the younger generation,\" which are natural. However, \"Internship Program\" may not be the correct name for the programme mentioned in the original.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, natural, and maintain the tone and intent of the original. It should use the correct name of the programme (\"Trainee Manager Programme\"), avoid overly formal or awkward phrasing, and ensure clarity and fluency. Based on the above review, the first and fifth translations are the most accurate and natural. However, the fifth translation uses \"Trainee Manager Program\" (without the \"e\" in \"Programme\") and \"HKMA's work\" instead of \"the HKMA's work,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to enhancing public understanding of the financial industry and fostering interest among the younger generation in joining the HKMA or the financial sector. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA's Trainee Manager Programme share their firsthand experiences, not only introducing the program to prospective applicants but also deepening their understanding of the HKMA's work.\n\nTrainee Manager Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews\nThe original Chinese text is \"見習經理計劃畢業生分享如何準備面試,\" which translates to \"Trainee Manager Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with some minor differences in phrasing and structure.\nThe first translation, \"Trainee Manager Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews,\" is accurate and concise. It directly translates the original text and maintains the intended meaning.\nThe second translation, \"Graduates of the Trainee Manager Program Share How to Prepare for an Interview,\" is also accurate but slightly more wordy. The use of \"an Interview\" with a capital \"I\" may be unnecessary unless it refers to a specific interview.\nThe third translation, \"Internship Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews,\" is less accurate because \"見習經理計劃\" refers specifically to a \"Trainee Manager Program,\" not a general \"Internship Program.\"\nThe fourth translation, \"Management trainee programs: Graduates share tips on how to prepare for interviews,\" is more of a headline-style translation. It uses a colon and the word \"tips\" which is not present in the original text. This may be appropriate for a headline but may not be suitable for a more formal or informative context.\nThe fifth translation, \"Graduates of the Trainee Manager Program Share How to Prepare for Interviews,\" is identical to the first translation and is also accurate and concise.\nThe sixth translation, \"Management Trainee Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews,\" is also accurate and concise. It uses \"Management Trainee Program\" instead of \"Trainee Manager Program,\" which is a slight variation in phrasing but still conveys the same meaning.\nOverall, the most accurate and concise translation is \"Trainee Manager Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews.\" This translation directly reflects the original Chinese text and maintains the intended meaning without unnecessary additions or alterations.\n\nTo enhance secondary school students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with multiple relevant organizations, is co-organizing the 8th consecutive edition of the \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Challenge.\" This year's theme focuses on green and sustainable finance, through which students gain new knowledge via an online quiz competition (which saw the highest number of participants in its history), webinars, and design thinking competitions.\n\nStudents present creative solutions incorporating green and sustainable elements in a design thinking competition to address the need for managing personal finances.\n\nThe original text describes a financial education initiative by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aimed at kindergarten and primary school students. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the organization behind the initiative.\n- The core activities (animated videos, storytelling, toy-making, expert sessions) are consistently translated.\n- The target audience (kindergarten and primary students) is accurately conveyed.\n- The key concepts (paper money, coins, banking, payment services, financial knowledge) are all present in the translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" or \"Little Financial Planner\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"Little Financial Managers,\" which may be inaccurate or less commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the program aimed to teach\" or \"the activities aim to help,\" which can be improved for smoother readability.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"special holiday\" is used in some translations, but \"school break\" or \"public holiday\" may be more natural in English-speaking contexts.\n- **Nuance and Precision:** The original mentions \"幼稚園及初小學生\" (kindergarten and primary school students), which should be translated precisely to reflect the educational level.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct official name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"Little Financial Managers\" as the official program name, as it is more consistent with the original.\n- Use \"school break\" or \"public holiday\" instead of \"special holiday\" for clarity.\n- Ensure the structure is fluent and natural, avoiding overly formal or awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain the precise educational level of the target audience.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the \"Little Financial Managers\" online parent-child financial education program during the March school break and August summer vacation in the 2021-22 academic year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, making simple toys, and sharing sessions with financial and early childhood education experts, the program helped kindergarten and primary school students learn about paper money and coins, basic concepts of banking and payment services, and financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills through online learning.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards). The Finance Department prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with HKFRS, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. In addition, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of each expenditure item and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Oversight\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Traditional Chinese text is \"# 問責性及監控,\" which translates to \"Accountability and Oversight\" or \"Accountability and Monitoring.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, with \"Accountability and Oversight\" and \"Accountability and Monitoring\" being the two primary options.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Accountability and Oversight\"** is a more formal and commonly used term in governance and institutional contexts. \"Oversight\" implies a broader, more supervisory role, often associated with regulatory bodies or higher-level monitoring. It is a natural fit for official or policy-related documents.\n- **\"Accountability and Monitoring\"** is also correct but slightly more technical and narrower in scope. \"Monitoring\" suggests a more routine, ongoing process of observation or data collection, which may be appropriate in contexts like performance evaluation or compliance tracking.\n- All translations are grammatically correct and fluent in English. However, the use of the hashtag (#) in the original text is retained in some translations, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context. If this is part of a document title or heading, it may be acceptable; however, in formal writing, the hashtag is often omitted unless it serves a specific stylistic or structural purpose.\n- The repetition of similar translations suggests that the junior translators may not have fully considered the nuances of the terms \"oversight\" and \"monitoring\" in the context of governance or institutional frameworks.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nGiven the context of governance, policy, or institutional frameworks, \"Accountability and Oversight\" is the more appropriate and natural translation. It conveys a broader, more authoritative sense of supervision and responsibility, which aligns well with the original Chinese terms. The hashtag can be omitted unless it is stylistically required. Thus, the best translation is:\n# Accountability and Oversight\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's most important responsibilities. Risk management is not only reflected in strategic planning but also applied at the operational level. The HKMA's risk management framework includes two high-level committees: the Macro-prudential Oversight Committee and the Risk Committee, both of which are chaired by the Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of a committee related to the supervision of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately capture the core meaning of the original text.\n- The use of terms like “macroprudential oversight” and “macroeconomic surveillance” is consistent with financial terminology.\n- The structure of the list is preserved in all translations, maintaining clarity and readability.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the name of the committee. Some translations use “Macroprudential Oversight Committee,” while others use “Macroeconomic Surveillance Committee.” The original Chinese uses “宏觀監察委員會,” which more closely aligns with “Macroprudential Oversight Committee” in financial contexts.\n- **Verb Tense and Style:** Some translations use “To identify” and “To review” in the infinitive form, while others use the base verb form. The infinitive form is more formal and appropriate for official documents.\n- **Redundancy and Fluency:** Some translations repeat phrases like “macroprudential oversight” or “macroeconomic surveillance” unnecessarily, which can reduce fluency.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term “Hong Kong Monetary Authority” is correctly used in all translations, which is appropriate for the context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The name of the committee should be standardized as “Macroprudential Oversight Committee” to align with the original Chinese and financial terminology.\n- The use of the infinitive form (“To identify,” “To review,” “To encourage”) is more formal and suitable for official documents.\n- The phrase “potential gaps” in one translation is less precise than “potential vulnerabilities” or “potential weaknesses.”\n- The phrase “thereby enhancing” is more natural than “to enhance” in the context of a result clause.\n- The term “cross-departmental sharing” is more concise and natural than “sharing of macroprudential oversight information across departments.”\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the most accurate and consistent terminology, maintain a formal tone, and ensure clarity and fluency.\nThe Macroprudential Oversight Committee's responsibilities are as follows:\n- To identify potential risks and threats facing Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, and to discuss feasible countermeasures;\n- To review the current risk management measures of the monetary and financial system, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- To encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential oversight information, thereby enhancing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's macroprudential oversight capabilities.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and consistency that affect the quality of the translations. Below is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Risk Committee's responsibilities and use appropriate terms such as \"risk management,\" \"strategies to mitigate impact,\" and \"resource allocation.\"\n- The structure of the bullet points is consistent across translations, maintaining the original format.\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" or \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" to refer to the organization, which is acceptable, though \"HKMA\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Different translations use different names for the organization (e.g., \"HKMA,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Financial Supervisory Authority\"). This inconsistency can confuse readers, especially if the organization is referenced elsewhere in the document.\n- **Verb Tense and Voice:** Some translations use active voice (\"developing strategies,\" \"reviewing systems\"), while others use passive or infinitive forms (\"to identify,\" \"to review\"). The use of active voice is more natural in English for such formal documents.\n- **Word Choice:** Some translations use \"gaps\" or \"vulnerabilities\" interchangeably, but \"gaps\" may not be the most precise term in the context of risk management systems.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly more verbose or less fluent than others. For example, \"determine the priority order for resource management\" is less natural than \"prioritize resource allocation.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Use \"HKMA\" consistently throughout the translation, as it is the official name of the organization.\n- **Active Voice and Natural Phrasing:** Use active voice for clarity and fluency, such as \"identifying potential risks\" rather than \"to identify potential risks.\"\n- **Precise Vocabulary:** Use \"vulnerabilities\" or \"weaknesses\" for risk management systems and \"gaps\" for areas lacking in procedures or controls.\n- **Conciseness and Flow:** Avoid overly wordy phrases like \"determine the priority order for resource management\" in favor of more concise expressions like \"prioritize resource allocation.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Risk Committee's responsibilities include the following:\n- Identifying potential risks and threats facing the HKMA and developing strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Reviewing the existing risk management systems in each department, identifying potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to address them;\n- Establishing uniform risk assessment criteria and methods, and prioritizing resource allocation based on identified risks; and\n- Encouraging and strengthening the risk management culture within the HKMA, promoting appropriate delegation of authority and monitoring.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately describe the operational risk management framework.\n- The concept of institutional and departmental risk levels is consistently translated, with most using \"institutional-level risks\" or \"institutional risks.\"\n- The process of quarterly reviews, reporting, and top-down risk management is well captured in all versions.\n- The mention of the Risk Committee and its role in reviewing assessments and determining follow-up actions is present in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the entire institution\" and \"cross-departmental collaboration,\" which are accurate but slightly less formal than \"the entire organization\" or \"cross-departmental responses.\"\n- **Translation 2** correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"medium-term risks,\" and includes \"on a quarterly basis,\" which is more precise than \"quarterly\" alone.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"The Monetary Authority\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a minor but important inaccuracy.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"coordinated response across departments\" and \"periodically reviewed,\" which are natural and precise.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to \"The Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a significant error.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"organizational structure risks\" instead of \"organizational risks,\" which may imply a focus on structure rather than risk itself, and \"deliberated by the Risk Committee\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the full and correct name of the institution: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- \"Medium-term risks\" is more natural than \"mid-term risks.\"\n- \"On a quarterly basis\" is more precise than \"quarterly.\"\n- \"Cross-departmental responses\" or \"cross-departmental collaboration\" are both acceptable, but \"cross-departmental collaboration\" is more commonly used in risk management contexts.\n- \"Organizational risks\" is more accurate than \"organizational structure risks.\"\n- The phrase \"supported by a top-down institutional risk management approach\" is clear and natural.\n- The final sentence should be concise and precise, using \"reviewed and determined\" rather than \"reviewed and deliberated.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers organizational risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks faced by the entire organization or risks requiring cross-departmental collaboration. During implementation, each department is required to review and report on its potential and emerging risks, as well as the monitoring measures and mitigation strategies proposed, on a quarterly basis. This is supported by a top-down institutional risk management approach, enabling senior management in each department to identify major risks with broader impacts and recommend mitigation measures. These assessments are regularly reviewed and appropriate follow-up actions are determined by the Risk Committee.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Internal Audit Department\/Division and its role in assessing the HKMA's governance, risk management, and monitoring processes.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key functions of the department are accurately conveyed.\n- The use of \"risk-based approach\" and \"major risk areas\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for the context.\n- The mention of 28 audits in 2022 and the areas covered (reserve management, banking supervision, etc.) is accurately reflected in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Department\" while others use \"Division.\" The original Chinese uses \"處\" (chù), which is more commonly translated as \"Division\" in official contexts.\n- **\"Monitoring processes\" vs. \"monitoring procedures\" vs. \"monitoring and control processes\":** The original uses \"監控程序\" (jiānkòng chéngxù), which is best translated as \"monitoring processes\" or \"monitoring procedures.\" Some translations use \"monitoring and control processes,\" which may be slightly broader than intended.\n- **\"Functionally\" vs. \"operationally\":** The original specifies that the Internal Audit Division reports \"職能上\" (zhínéng shàng) to the Audit Committee, which is more accurately translated as \"functionally\" rather than \"operationally.\"\n- **\"Reserves management\" vs. \"reserve management\":** The original uses \"儲備管理\" (chǔbèi guǎnlǐ), which is best translated as \"reserve management\" without the plural \"reserves.\"\n- **\"Monetary and financial development\" vs. \"currency and financial development\":** The original uses \"貨幣與金融發展\" (huòbì yǔ jīnróng fāzhǎn), which is more accurately translated as \"monetary and financial development\" rather than \"currency and financial development.\"\n- **\"Audit results showed\" vs. \"audit results indicated\":** The original uses \"審核結果顯示\" (shěnhé jiéguǒ xiǎnshì), which is more naturally translated as \"audit results indicated\" or \"audit results showed,\" but \"indicated\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for official reports.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"Division\" consistently, as it aligns with the formal structure of the original.\n- Use \"monitoring processes\" to match the original's \"監控程序.\"\n- Use \"functionally\" to accurately reflect \"職能上.\"\n- Use \"reserve management\" without the plural \"reserves.\"\n- Use \"monetary and financial development\" to match the original's \"貨幣與金融發展.\"\n- Use \"indicated\" for \"顯示\" to maintain a formal tone appropriate for an official report.\n---\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. Functionally, it reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in conducting its operations and information systems audits, covering all major risk areas. In 2022, the Division carried out 28 audits covering the HKMA's reserve management, banking supervision, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other institutional functions. The audit results indicated that the HKMA has sufficient and effective monitoring measures in place to manage the risks arising from its operations.\n"}

These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2022, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements fairly and accurately present the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in compliance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Basis of Opinion\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"意見的基礎,\" translates literally to \"The Basis of Opinion.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, most of which are close to the correct translation. However, there are a few points to consider for improvement:\n1. **Capitalization and Punctuation:** The use of the hash symbol (#) at the beginning of some translations is unnecessary unless the original text is formatted as a heading in a document or list. Since the original does not include a hash, it should be omitted in the translation.\n2. **Singular vs. Plural:** The original uses \"意見\" (opinion), which is singular. However, in some translations, such as \"The Foundation of Opinions,\" the plural form is used. This may be acceptable in certain contexts, but unless the original text clearly implies multiple opinions, the singular form is more accurate.\n3. **Fluency and Naturalness:** \"Basis of opinion\" is grammatically correct but slightly more informal and less natural than \"The Basis of Opinion,\" which is a standard title format in academic or formal writing.\n4. **Consistency:** The translations vary in punctuation and capitalization, which can affect the perceived professionalism of the title.\nConsidering these points, the most natural and professional translation would be \"The Basis of Opinion,\" which maintains the singular form, avoids unnecessary punctuation, and uses proper capitalization. This version is concise, clear, and appropriate for formal or academic contexts.\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters in the audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, but I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 12,074.98 billion.\n\nThe original sentence discusses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities, specifying that 87% of the assets and all liabilities are measured using either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to financial terminology.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, using \"quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets\" and \"inputs that are based on observable market data.\" It is concise and natural.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate but slightly wordy, using \"the fair values of such financial assets and all the fair values of such financial liabilities,\" which is redundant. It could be more concise.\n**Translation 3** is well-structured and uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is a common financial term. However, it adds \"which is based on...\" which slightly changes the structure of the original sentence, making it less direct.\n**Translation 4** uses \"same assets or liabilities\" instead of \"identical,\" which is less precise in financial terminology. Also, \"parameters\" is used instead of \"inputs,\" which is not standard in fair value measurement contexts.\n**Translation 5** is concise and accurate, using \"valued at fair value\" and \"inputs based on observable market data.\" It is very close to the original in structure and meaning.\n**Translation 6** is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"the fair value of all these financial liabilities,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"all of these financial liabilities are based on...\" as in Translation 1.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"identical\" instead of \"same\" for financial assets\/liabilities.\n- Use \"inputs\" instead of \"parameters\" for Level 1 and Level 2.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"the fair values of.\"\n- Maintain a clear and direct structure that reflects the original sentence's emphasis on the percentage of assets and liabilities measured using specific inputs.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe fair value of 87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe original text discusses the fair value estimation of 13% of financial assets using Level 3 parameters, which are not based on observable market data, and specifies the total amount and composition of these assets.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"HKD 487.69 billion\" is incorrect; the original states \"4,876.94億港元,\" which is 4,876.94 billion HKD, not 487.69 billion. Also, \"unlisted\" is less formal than \"non-listed\" in financial contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very close to the correct meaning. It uses \"Level 3 inputs\" (a common term in accounting standards), and the number is correctly translated as \"HKD 487.694 billion.\" However, \"non-listed\" is slightly less standard than \"unlisted\" in financial terminology.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"Level 3 parameters\" and \"non-listed investment funds,\" which are appropriate. The number is correctly translated as \"HKD 487.694 billion.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"comprising\" instead of \"consisting of,\" which is slightly less common in financial reporting.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"determined\" instead of \"estimated,\" which is slightly different in tone but still acceptable. The use of \"HK$487.694 billion\" is correct, though \"HKD\" is more standard in formal financial contexts. \"Unlisted\" is acceptable but \"non-listed\" is more common in financial reporting.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is problematic due to the incorrect conversion of \"4,876.94億港元\" to \"4,876.94 billion HKD.\" The correct value is 487.694 billion HKD, not 4,876.94 billion. This is a critical error that changes the meaning significantly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"valuation methods that rely on parameters not based on observable market data,\" which is slightly wordy but accurate. The number is correctly translated as \"HKD 487.694 billion,\" and \"non-listed investment funds\" is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, use standard financial terminology, and ensure numerical accuracy. Based on the above review, the third and sixth translations are the strongest, with the third being slightly more concise and natural in tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of such financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total amount of these financial assets is HKD 487.694 billion, mainly comprising non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the original Chinese sentence, the goal is to convey that the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value is a key audit matter due to the large amounts involved and the reliance on estimates. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"significant amounts\" and \"the need for estimates.\" While accurate, \"the need for estimates\" is slightly vague and less precise than alternatives like \"the use of estimates\" or \"reliance on estimates.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"the use of estimates,\" which is more precise than \"the need for estimates.\" Also uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is more standard in financial reporting than \"accounted for at fair value.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"large amounts\" instead of \"significant amounts,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal. Also uses \"involvement of estimates,\" which is somewhat awkward compared to \"use of estimates\" or \"reliance on estimates.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"significant amount\" (singular) instead of \"amounts\" (plural), which is grammatically incorrect given the context of multiple financial assets and liabilities. Also uses \"estimates\" without a preposition, which is less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"reliance on estimates,\" which is a strong and precise choice. Also uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is standard in financial terminology. This translation is very close to the ideal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"substantial amount\" (singular) instead of \"amounts\" (plural), which is grammatically incorrect. Also uses \"involvement of estimates,\" which is less precise than \"reliance on estimates.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"significant amounts\" (plural) to match the original Chinese, which refers to multiple financial assets and liabilities. It should also use \"reliance on estimates\" to convey the dependence on estimation techniques, which is a key point in audit contexts. The phrase \"measured at fair value\" is more standard in financial reporting than \"accounted for at fair value\" or \"valued at fair value.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are variations in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that can be refined for greater clarity and professional tone. Below is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the audit procedures related to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n- The structure of the list is preserved in all translations, which is essential for clarity in audit documentation.\n- The use of terms like \"valuation procedures,\" \"monitoring measures,\" and \"independent sources\" is consistent and appropriate in the context of auditing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"monitoring measures\" while others use \"controls\" or \"application controls.\" In auditing, \"controls\" is more standard terminology, especially when referring to internal control systems.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use \"based on\" or \"against\" inconsistently. For example, \"verifying prices based on independent sources\" is less natural than \"verifying prices against independent sources.\"\n- **Word Choice:** \"Obtaining confirmations\" is slightly less precise than \"obtaining audit evidence\" or \"obtaining confirmations from third parties,\" depending on the context.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases such as \"evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate\" in both the \"observable market data\" and \"non-observable market data\" sections, which can be streamlined for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use of standard auditing terminology such as \"controls\" and \"audit evidence\" will enhance the professionalism of the translation.\n- Ensuring consistent prepositions (e.g., \"against\" rather than \"based on\") will improve fluency.\n- Streamlining repetitive phrases will make the translation more concise and reader-friendly.\n- Maintaining parallel structure in the list items will improve readability and ensure that each audit procedure is clearly presented.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related controls;\n- Evaluating and testing the effectiveness of controls, including application controls related to computer systems;\n- Obtaining audit evidence regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations are used;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of related assumptions, and verifying the parameters against independent sources, when the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters, when the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese text, \"# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值,\" is a title or heading likely used in a financial or accounting context. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, with slight differences in capitalization, word choice, and punctuation.\nTranslation 1: \"Valuation of investment property measured at fair value.\" This is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, it uses lowercase for \"investment property,\" which may not be appropriate for a title.\nTranslation 2: \"# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\" uses \"Carried at Fair Value,\" which is a common accounting term. However, the use of \"Carried\" may be less precise than \"Measured\" in this context, and the hashtag is retained, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context.\nTranslation 3: \"Valuation of investment property measured at fair value\" is identical in meaning to Translation 1, but with the same issue of lowercase usage.\nTranslation 4: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\" uses \"Properties\" instead of \"Property,\" which is more accurate if the text refers to multiple investment properties. It also capitalizes appropriately for a title.\nTranslation 5: \"# Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\" uses \"Accounted for at Fair Value,\" which is a slightly different phrasing. While still correct, \"Accounted for\" may be less commonly used in this specific context compared to \"Measured at Fair Value.\"\nTranslation 6: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\" is very similar to Translation 4, with the same strengths in word choice and capitalization.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use \"Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value.\" This version is grammatically correct, uses the appropriate terminology, and capitalizes the title appropriately. It also uses \"Properties\" to indicate that the text may be referring to multiple investment properties, which is more precise than \"Property.\" The hashtag is omitted unless it is specifically required for formatting purposes, as it is not part of the original Chinese text.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 of the financial statements.\n\nThe original text provides a financial overview of a group's investment properties, including their valuation, the group's interests in various entities, and the methodology used for valuation. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and numerical formatting.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but has a critical error in the numerical values (HKD 23.394 billion instead of 233.94 billion and similarly for the second value). This is a significant issue in a financial context. The structure is clear and the language is fluent.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of numbers and terminology. It uses \"accounted for at fair value\" which is more precise than \"carried at fair value.\" The structure is clear and the language is natural.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation uses HK$ instead of HKD, which is acceptable but less formal in a financial report. The numbers are also incorrect (23.394 billion instead of 233.94 billion). The language is fluent but slightly less formal.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of numbers and terminology. It uses \"accounted for at fair value\" and has a clear structure. The language is natural and appropriate for a financial context.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation has a minor issue in the order of \"4 joint ventures and 22 associate companies,\" which may be confusing. The numbers are correct, and the language is fluent.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of numbers and terminology. It uses \"accounted for at fair value\" and has a clear structure. The language is natural and appropriate for a financial context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be accurate in numbers, use precise financial terminology, and maintain a formal and professional tone. \"Accounted for at fair value\" is more precise than \"carried at fair value\" in financial reporting. The use of \"HKD\" is more standard in financial contexts than \"HK$.\" The structure should clearly distinguish between the group's direct holdings and those through associates or joint ventures. The phrase \"independent professional valuers\" is more commonly used than \"appraisers\" in financial reporting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in four associate companies and 22 joint ventures, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at a total of HKD 396.31 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, is primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the audit procedures for investment properties measured or accounted for at fair value.\n- The structure of the bullet points is consistent across translations, maintaining clarity and readability.\n- The use of terms like \"valuation reports,\" \"independence and qualifications of the valuers,\" and \"appropriateness of the valuation methods\" is accurate and standard in audit and financial reporting contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Variance:** Some translations use \"accounted for at fair value,\" while others use \"measured at fair value.\" In financial reporting, \"measured at fair value\" is more precise and commonly used in IFRS and GAAP contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"valuation reports\" unnecessarily, such as \"the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports,\" which can be simplified to \"the valuations stated in the relevant reports.\"\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Phrases like \"verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant reports\" are grammatically correct but can be made more concise and natural, such as \"verifying that fair value is based on the valuations in the relevant reports.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term \"jointly controlled entities\" appears in one translation, which is technically correct but less commonly used than \"joint ventures\" or \"associates\" in audit contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"measured at fair value\" as it is the more standard term in financial reporting.\n- Simplify and streamline phrasing to enhance fluency and readability.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, using \"associates\" and \"joint ventures\" as per common usage.\n- Avoid redundancy by eliminating unnecessary repetition of \"valuation reports.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that fair value is based on the valuations in the relevant reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe original text specifies that the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" is responsible for \"other data,\" which includes all information in the \"Financial Management Bureau's 2022 Annual Report,\" excluding the financial statements and the auditor's report. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** is accurate in terms of content but uses \"data\" instead of \"information,\" which is slightly less natural in this context. It also uses \"Financial Management Bureau,\" which may not be the official English name of the institution.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Management Officer\" instead of \"Commissioner,\" which is a key title and should be preserved. It also refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the correct entity referenced in the original text.\n**Translation 3** is the most accurate in terms of title and content, using \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Financial Management Authority.\" However, it uses \"data\" instead of \"information,\" which is slightly less natural in this context.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Financial Services Authority,\" which is not the correct entity. It also uses \"Financial Management Officer\" instead of \"Commissioner.\"\n**Translation 5** uses \"Financial management officers\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the formal title. It also uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the correct entity.\n**Translation 6** incorrectly uses \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Commissioner\" and refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the correct entity. It also uses \"auditors' report\" with an apostrophe, which is grammatically incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should preserve the exact title \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" use the correct entity name (likely \"Financial Management Bureau\"), and use \"information\" rather than \"data\" for a more natural tone. It should also ensure grammatical correctness and consistency in title capitalization.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for other information. This information includes all the information in the Financial Management Bureau's 2022 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to review other information in order to assess whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original Chinese text is:  \n**# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Secretary and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Audit Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Financial Secretary\" is not the correct title for \"金融管理專員\" (Financial Management Officer). Also, the structure is awkward and unclear about the relationship between the entities.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   *\"Responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"regarding\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Again, \"Financial Secretary\" is incorrect. Also, the structure implies the Financial Secretary is part of the Audit Committee, which is not accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   *\"Responsibilities of the Financial Controller and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with Respect to Financial Statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"with Respect to\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Financial Controller\" is not the correct title for \"金融管理專員.\" Also, the structure is still unclear.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Officer and Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"under the Financial Management Officer and Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is awkward and unclear in terms of hierarchy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" which is closer to the intended meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The structure is still unclear and the phrase \"under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   *\"Responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer and the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Financial Management Officer\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Review Committee\" is not the correct term for \"審核委員會\" (Audit Committee). Also, the structure is unclear.\n### Reasoning for Improved Translation:\nThe original text refers to the **Audit Committee** under the **Financial Management Officer** and the **Exchange Fund Advisory Committee**, and its **responsibilities regarding financial statements**. The key is to clearly establish the hierarchical relationship and use the correct titles.\n- \"金融管理專員\" should be translated as **Commissioner of Financial Management** or **Financial Management Officer**, depending on the official title used in the jurisdiction.\n- \"審核委員會\" is best translated as **Audit Committee**.\n- \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" is **Exchange Fund Advisory Committee**.\n- The phrase \"就財務報表而須承擔的責任\" should be translated as **responsibilities regarding financial statements** or **responsibilities in relation to financial statements**.\n### Improved Translation:\n**The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.**\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer in preparing accurate financial statements in accordance with specific accounting standards and legal directives, while also ensuring internal controls to prevent material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of legal terminology. However, the phrase \"the officer considers necessary\" may be slightly ambiguous, as it could imply the officer is the one making the determination, which may not be the intended nuance.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very similar to the first, but it splits the sentence into two for clarity. It uses \"they\" instead of \"the officer,\" which is more inclusive and appropriate in a general statement. This is a minor but notable improvement in clarity and formality.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer.\" Additionally, it uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants\" instead of \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants,\" which is a misnomer. The term \"he\" is also outdated and less inclusive.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"financial management officers\" in plural, which may not align with the original text that refers to a singular role. It also uses \"promulgated\" and \"directions,\" which are slightly less standard in legal English than \"issued\" or \"instructions.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. It uses \"they\" and \"resulting from,\" which are appropriate. However, \"accurate and fair\" is slightly different from \"true and fair,\" which is a standard phrase in financial reporting.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Financial management professionals,\" which is too vague and does not match the specific title in the original. It also incorrectly refers to the \"Exchange Fund Bill\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is a critical legal error.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise legal terminology, and ensure clarity and inclusivity. It should also correctly identify the role as \"Financial Management Officer\" and reference the correct legal document, \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\" The use of \"they\" is preferable to \"he\" or \"the officer\" for inclusivity, and \"true and fair\" is the standard phrase in financial reporting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing financial statements that are true and fair in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management officer must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of the Translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"overseeing.\" It is grammatically correct and maintains the formal tone of the original.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" instead of \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" While \"Exchange Fund\" may be acceptable in some contexts, the full term \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is more precise and commonly used in official documents.\n3. **Translation 3** is identical to Translation 1 and is therefore equally accurate.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Group’s\" with an uppercase \"G,\" which is appropriate if \"Group\" is a proper noun. However, it omits \"Foreign\" in \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which may be a minor oversight.\n5. **Translation 5** is identical to Translation 1 and is accurate.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"audit committee\" with a lowercase \"a\" and \"supervising\" instead of \"overseeing.\" While \"supervising\" is a synonym, \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts. The lowercase \"audit\" may be acceptable in some contexts, but in official documents, it is often capitalized.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe most accurate and natural translation should:\n- Use the full and official name: **Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee**.\n- Use **\"overseeing\"** as it is more standard in formal financial reporting contexts.\n- Capitalize **\"Group\"** if it refers to a specific entity.\n- Ensure proper grammar and capitalization.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The original title, \"# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任,\" translates to \"The Responsibility of Auditors in Relation to the Audit of Financial Statements.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"# Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\" is concise and clear, but the use of the hashtag \"#\" may be unnecessary unless the context requires it (e.g., for social media or headings in a document). It is otherwise grammatically correct and fluent.\nTranslation 2: \"Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\" is slightly more natural than Translation 1, as \"for\" is often used in formal titles to denote the subject of responsibility. However, it lacks the article \"the\" before \"Responsibility,\" which may make it sound less formal.\nTranslation 3: \"The Responsibilities of Auditors in Relation to the Audit of Financial Statements\" is the most comprehensive and grammatically correct. It uses \"Responsibilities\" (plural) which may be more appropriate if the context implies multiple responsibilities. However, the original Chinese uses \"責任\" (responsibility), which is singular, so \"Responsibility\" might be more accurate.\nTranslation 4: \"Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\" is identical to Translation 2 and suffers from the same issue of missing the article \"the.\"\nTranslation 5: \"The responsibilities of an auditor in relation to the audit of financial statements.\" uses \"an auditor\" instead of \"auditors,\" which is less general and may not be appropriate for a formal title. It also uses \"responsibilities\" (plural) and \"an auditor\" (singular), which is inconsistent with the original.\nTranslation 6: \"The Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\" is grammatically correct and uses the possessive form \"Auditor’s,\" which is appropriate for a formal title. However, it refers to \"an auditor\" rather than \"auditors\" in general, which may be too specific for a general title.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be one that is grammatically correct, uses the appropriate article, and maintains the general reference to \"auditors\" rather than a specific \"auditor.\" It should also use \"Responsibility\" (singular) to match the original Chinese, and avoid unnecessary hashtags or overly specific references.\nThe improved translation would be: \"The Responsibility of Auditors in Relation to the Audit of Financial Statements.\" This version is grammatically correct, uses the appropriate article, maintains the general reference to \"auditors,\" and accurately reflects the original Chinese title.\nThe Responsibility of Auditors in Relation to the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nThroughout the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events;\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have met all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them any relationships or matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, along with any relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several common issues emerge that affect the quality and fluency of the English renditions. First, there is inconsistency in the translation of the name of the committee. Some translations use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" while others use \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" or \"External Funds Advisory Committee.\" The correct and most commonly accepted term in financial and regulatory contexts is \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which should be used consistently.\nSecond, the phrase \"from the matters communicated with the Audit Committee\" is used in some translations, but the more natural and grammatically correct phrasing is \"based on the matters communicated to me by the Audit Committee\" or \"based on my communication with the Audit Committee.\" This choice affects the clarity and formality of the sentence.\nThird, the phrase \"unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter\" is more precise and natural than \"unless disclosure of a particular matter is prohibited by law or regulation.\" The former aligns better with the formal tone of audit reports and legal documents.\nFourth, the phrase \"in extremely rare circumstances, where I determine that the negative consequences...\" is more fluid and grammatically sound than \"in extremely rare circumstances, because there is a reasonable expectation...\" The latter introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity.\nFinally, the phrase \"the public interest derived from such communication\" is slightly awkward and can be improved to \"the public interest in such communication\" or \"the public benefit derived from such communication.\"\nTaking these observations into account, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise terminology, and ensure grammatical correctness and fluency.\n---\nBased on my communication with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public benefit derived from such communication.\n\nAuditor General  \nProfessor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nAudit Commission\" is the most accurate translation for \"審計署\" in the context of a government body responsible for auditing public finances. \"Audit Office\" is less precise and may be confused with a general office rather than a formal commission. \"Office of the Auditor General\" is more specific and is used in some jurisdictions, but it may not be the official name in Hong Kong.\nThe address \"66 Des Voeux Road Central\" is the correct translation for \"金鐘道66號.\" \"Des Voeux Road\" is the official English name of the road, and \"Central\" is the district. Other translations, such as \"Gloucester Road, Wan Chai\" or \"Queen's Road Central,\" are incorrect as they refer to different locations in Hong Kong.\nTherefore, the best translation would be:\nAudit Commission\nHong Kong\n66 Des Voeux Road Central\nAudit Commission\nHong Kong\n66 Des Voeux Road Central\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
