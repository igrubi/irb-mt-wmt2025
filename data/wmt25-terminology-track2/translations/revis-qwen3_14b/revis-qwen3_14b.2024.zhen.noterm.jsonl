{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","en":"# Stay alert and weather the storm.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority faced challenges head-on amidst a complex and volatile external environment. Throughout the year, ongoing regional military conflicts, significant elections in multiple countries, and an uncertain global economic outlook continued to cause global turbulence. However, policymakers worldwide sought a balanced approach to curbing soaring inflation while supporting economic growth, driving major economies toward steady growth. Additionally, with the U.S. initiating its first rate cut in four years and a series of pro-economic policies introduced by the mainland, market sentiment turned more optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains fraught with uncertainties.\n\nFaced with complex circumstances, our response strategy is to continue fully leveraging Hong Kong's role as a hub for offshore RMB business, financial technology, and green and sustainable finance, as well as its unique advantages, to continuously consolidate Hong Kong's leading position as an international financial center. In 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority achieved significant progress in these key areas. Events and initiatives such as the annual \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" received enthusiastic responses, fully demonstrating the international community's firm confidence in Hong Kong's development prospects as an international financial center.\n\nIn response to the cyclical adjustments and structural transformation of Hong Kong's economy, we have closely collaborated with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviating their repayment burdens in a high-interest rate environment while helping them achieve sustainable development. Combined with various policy measures introduced by the central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Hong Kong's economy has steadily recovered. In 2024, the local economy recorded a moderate growth of 2.5%.\n\nAs we step into 2025, the global economy continues to face numerous uncertainties amid an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Rising trade protectionism and escalating tariff barriers are likely to disrupt global supply chains and intensify geopolitical economic fragmentation, adding further variables to the outlook for the global economy. Should geopolitical tensions escalate further, they could deliver a double blow to the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFaced with a complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will remain vigilant and diligently fulfill its responsibilities, striving to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, and continuously consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. We will strengthen our engagement with various sectors of the market, actively promote the development of emerging areas, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains its leading edge in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: A Stable Foundation\n\nThe original text discusses the Linked Exchange Rate System (聯匯制度) and its role in maintaining Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past 40 years. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology, phrasing, and nuance that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths of the translations:**\n- All translations correctly identify the system as the \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" and convey its role as a \"cornerstone\" of stability.\n- The phrase \"successfully withstanding\" or \"weathering\" multiple economic and interest rate cycles is well used and conveys the intended meaning of resilience.\n- The use of \"resilience\" or \"remarkable resilience\" effectively captures the system's ability to endure challenges.\n**Weaknesses and areas for improvement:**\n- **Redundancy and repetition:** Some translations repeat the full name of the system in parentheses unnecessarily, such as \"Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked Exchange Rate System)\" in Translation 1 and 5. This is redundant and can be simplified.\n- **Terminology:** \"Currency board system\" (used in Translation 2) is not the most accurate term for the \"linked exchange rate system\" in the context of Hong Kong. The term \"linked exchange rate system\" is more commonly used in official and academic discussions about Hong Kong's monetary framework.\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** While all translations are grammatically correct, some use \"withstanding the challenges of\" (Translation 1 and 5), which is slightly less natural than \"weathering\" or \"withstanding\" without the preposition \"of.\"\n- **Nuance:** Translation 4 uses \"remarkable resilience,\" which adds a slight emphasis on the system's exceptional performance, which may be more appropriate given the context of 40 years of stability.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct and commonly accepted term: \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- Avoid redundancy in parentheses.\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"weathering\" or \"withstanding\" without unnecessary prepositions.\n- Convey the nuance of the system's long-term success and resilience with appropriate adjectives.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for over 40 years, successfully weathering numerous economic and interest rate cycles and demonstrating remarkable resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rate policy in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar money market continued to operate smoothly under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar. In the first four months of the year, the exchange rate weakened slightly due to reduced liquidity, but it gradually strengthened afterward and approached the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level by year-end. The stable exchange rate fully reflects the market's confidence in the LERS. At the same time, the LERS has continued to receive high recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the linked exchange rate system is built on our ongoing proactive efforts to communicate the system's mechanisms and advantages to the public, as well as our rigorous market surveillance. By collecting detailed data and combining it with advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies, we are able to monitor the market more promptly and comprehensively, and assess financial stability more effectively.\n\n# Banking System: Maintaining Stability Amid Multiple Challenges\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's banking system demonstrated strong resilience amid multiple macroeconomic challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining ample. By the end of 2024, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also abundant, with the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, surpassing the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. The specific classification loan ratio rose to 1.96% by year-end, influenced by factors such as persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt issues in some mainland Chinese real estate companies, and a weak local commercial real estate market. However, due to banks' adherence to prudent credit risk management and maintenance of adequate provisions, the related risks remained overall manageable.\n\nWhile all six translations capture the core meaning of the original text, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to formal English conventions. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. However, \"has implemented\" is slightly inconsistent with the past tense used in the rest of the sentence. Also, \"recovered to the levels in place before\" is slightly awkward compared to \"restored to the levels prior to.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in structure and meaning. The use of \"reverted to the levels before\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"restored to the levels in place before.\" However, \"reverted\" may be less commonly used in regulatory contexts than \"restored.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"reverted to the levels prevailing before,\" which is both precise and natural. The inclusion of \"(HKMA)\" adds clarity. However, \"reverted\" may still be less common in this context than \"restored.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. The use of \"reverted to the levels prior to\" is appropriate. The phrase \"regulatory measures\" adds a slight nuance that may be more precise than \"measures\" alone. However, \"reverted\" is still less common in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is clear and accurate. However, \"has implemented\" is inconsistent with the past tense used in the rest of the sentence. Also, \"restored to the levels prevailing before\" is slightly awkward compared to \"restored to the levels prior to.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very strong. It uses \"were restored to their levels prior to the introduction of,\" which is both natural and precise. The use of \"debt-service-to-income ratio cap\" is more specific than \"debt-to-income ratio,\" which may be more accurate in a regulatory context.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"restored\" rather than \"reverted\" for clarity and common usage in regulatory contexts. It should also maintain consistent tense and use precise terminology such as \"debt-service-to-income ratio cap\" where appropriate. Including \"(HKMA)\" adds clarity, and \"prior to the implementation of\" is more natural than \"before the introduction of.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nWhile continuing to closely monitor bank credit risks, including those related to property mortgage loans, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) implemented two rounds of adjustments to the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgages in 2024 in response to changes in property market conditions and related risks within the banking system. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratios and the debt-service-to-income ratio caps for all residential properties have been restored to the levels prior to the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile all six translations are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to natural English expression. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: the need to enhance operational and technological resilience in banks due to reliance on third-party services, using the CrowdStrike incident as an example.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key terms such as \"operational resilience,\" \"third-party service providers,\" and \"scenario testing\" are well translated.\n- The use of \"CrowdStrike global incident\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for clarity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Pairing work\"** in translations 1, 3, and 6 is unclear and likely a mistranslation of the original Chinese term, which probably refers to \"mapping\" or \"alignment\" in the context of risk management.\n- **\"Currently in the crucial phase of pairing work and scenario testing\"** (translation 1) is awkward and lacks clarity.\n- **\"Have currently established\"** (translation 5) is redundant and unnatural.\n- **\"The functioning of critical businesses\"** (translation 5) is less precise than \"the continuity of critical business operations.\"\n- **\"Entering a crucial phase of mapping and scenario testing\"** (translation 4) is more natural than \"pairing work\" but could be improved for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Replace \"pairing work\" with \"mapping\" or \"alignment\" based on context.\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"are now in the crucial phase of mapping and scenario testing.\"\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"have currently established.\"\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, particularly around the process of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.\n- Use precise language such as \"continuity of critical business operations\" rather than \"functioning of critical businesses.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nWhile continuously strengthening bank credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological resilience of banks to address the new challenges arising from increasing reliance on third-party service providers. Taking the CrowdStrike global incident in July last year as an example, this event highlighted how operational failures can lead to severe cascading consequences in today’s highly interconnected global environment. Although the incident had limited impact on Hong Kong’s banking sector, it underscores the need to ensure banks have robust frameworks in place to maintain critical operations even in severe situations. Encouragingly, all Hong Kong banks have now established operational resilience frameworks and are entering a crucial phase of mapping and scenario testing, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities to ensure the continuity of critical business operations.\n\nAt the same time, to address evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) focused last year on strengthening the banking sector's cybersecurity defenses, including issuing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulators to advance the cross-industry \"Cyber Map\" project, which assesses and mitigates systemic cyber risks that may arise from interconnections among financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and technology service providers. Following a trial period completed in 2024, the project will be fully implemented this year.\n\nAnother major challenge brought about by technological development is the escalating threat of financial fraud, which is becoming increasingly sophisticated and requires joint efforts from banks, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, and the public. We have already asked banks to further strengthen their online banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group) also expanded its coverage to include all major retail banks and six licensed stored-value payment tool operators, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of intelligence sharing, and leading to an increase in the amount of criminal proceeds seized. At the same time, the legislative amendment consultation on promoting information sharing among banks has received widespread support. This legislation will help further enhance banks' ability to detect and prevent financial crimes.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures, raising public awareness of suspicious transactions and enhancing self-protection consciousness is equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and launched the \"Consumer Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0,\" incorporating more participating institutions to broaden the protective network and further safeguard the public. At the same time, we introduced the \"Smart Secure Savings Service,\" allowing bank customers to choose to segregate part of their deposits for additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures to help customers prevent fraud, we also addressed the issue of individual customers potentially overborrowing due to impulse. Last year, we required retail banks to provide a cooling-off period of at least seven days for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully reconsider and assess their financial responsibilities and repayment capabilities after entering into a loan agreement. At the same time, the \"Credit Information Infrastructure\" personal data initiative was successfully launched last year, achieving significant progress in enhancing personal credit data services.\n\nIn addition to regulatory work, another key focus for 2024 was ensuring credit availability to support the real economy, particularly crucial for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are vital pillars of Hong Kong's economy. Last year, we jointly introduced the \"9+5\" support measures with the banking sector to help SMEs access bank financing to meet working capital needs and support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have committed not to require mortgage customers making timely repayments to prepay their loans, nor to reduce credit limits solely due to a decline in collateral value. To date, over 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loan approvals, totaling HKD 95 billion in credit facilities. Banks have also set aside approximately HKD 390 billion in dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support SMEs in sustaining their development amid changing market conditions. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association jointly established the SME Financing Task Force to provide support to SMEs at both the individual case and industry-wide levels. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic outlook, we introduced three additional targeted support measures for specific industries in April 2025, further strengthening support for SMEs across multiple sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message of promoting technology in banking, the integration of fintech in retail banks, the role of GenAI, and the initiatives by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to foster innovation. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the main points, including the use of fintech in retail banking, the launch of the GenAI Sandbox, and the HKMA’s internal use of GenAI.\n- The use of \"generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for clarity.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Digital Hong Kong\" instead of \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP)\" or \"Cyberport,\" which may be less precise. It also uses \"FiNETech\" with a capital \"T\" inconsistently.\n- **Translation 2** correctly identifies \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP)\" but uses \"HKSTP\" instead of \"Cyberport,\" which is a different entity.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation\" but omits the acronym, which may be less efficient for readers familiar with the organization.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Cyberport\" but does not clarify it with the full name or acronym, which may be less precise for international readers.\n- **Translation 5** correctly uses \"HKMA collaborated with Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation\" and includes the full name and acronym, which is ideal for clarity.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Cyberport\" without clarification, similar to Translation 4, and uses \"FinTech\" with a capital \"T\" inconsistently.\n**Fluency and Grammar:**\n- Most translations are grammatically sound, though some use \"FiNETech\" or \"FinTech\" inconsistently, which may confuse readers.\n- Some translations use \"foster collaboration and innovation\" or \"fostering collaboration and innovation,\" which are both acceptable but could be more consistent.\n**Cultural Appropriateness:**\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate, but the partner organization (HKSTP or Cyberport) should be clearly identified with both the full name and acronym for clarity, especially for international audiences.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"FiNETech\" or \"FinTech\" with a capital \"T\" or not, depending on the intended branding.\n- Clarify the partner organization with both the full name and acronym (e.g., \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP)\" or \"Cyberport\").\n- Use \"foster\" consistently in the context of promoting collaboration and innovation.\n- Ensure that \"GenAI\" is used consistently with the full term \"generative artificial intelligence\" on first mention.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of all translations while addressing the inconsistencies and ambiguities in partner organizations and terminology.\n---\nWe continue to promote the application of technology in the banking sector to maintain the stability of the banking system and enhance its operational efficiency, and we are actively accelerating the adoption of financial technology (FinTech) in the banking industry. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have already applied FinTech to their daily operations. Furthermore, recognizing the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening risk management in the banking sector, preventing fraud, and enhancing customer experience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) last year to launch the \"GenAI Sandbox,\" encouraging banks to apply GenAI responsibly. At the same time, we have issued guidelines to banks, clearly stipulating that if banks use GenAI in customer-facing services, they must ensure adequate protection for customers. In addition, the HKMA is actively utilizing GenAI technology internally to improve analytical and regulatory efficiency. Beyond GenAI, we are also promoting connections between the financial services sector and the technology community by launching the new FiNETech series of events, establishing a matching platform called \"FintechConnect,\" and organizing a series of cross-industry exchange activities, thereby fostering collaboration and innovation within the FinTech ecosystem.\n\n# Strengthen Hong Kong's Position as an International Financial Center\n\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties of 2024, Hong Kong has maintained its leading position as an international financial center and continues to expand and enhance its influence in multiple areas on the global stage.\n\nHong Kong plays an irreplaceable and unique role as a bridge connecting mainland China with international markets. By introducing various initiatives and enhancing cooperation with all parties, Hong Kong continues to consolidate and elevate its position as a regional hub for fintech and sustainable finance. For details on our work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# The original Chinese text is a concise headline: # 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作. It conveys two main ideas: the rapid growth of RMB business and the deepening of financial cooperation with the mainland.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"RMB business is growing rapidly, and cooperation with mainland financial institutions is deepening.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and clear. Uses \"mainland financial institutions\" which is precise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy and less impactful as a headline. The use of \"cooperation\" is generic and could be more dynamic.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Rapid growth in RMB business and deepening cooperation with mainland financial institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and maintains the parallel structure of the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks a clear subject and verb, making it more of a phrase than a complete sentence. Not ideal for a headline.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"# Rapid Growth in RMB Business, Deepening Financial Cooperation with the Mainland\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the hashtag as in the original, and the phrasing is concise and impactful.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Deepening\" is a gerund, which may not be as strong as a verb in a headline. Also, \"the Mainland\" is slightly more formal than \"mainland.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"RMB business is growing rapidly, deepening financial cooperation with the mainland.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and maintains the original structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The second clause is a dangling modifier. It implies that the growth is deepening the cooperation, which is not grammatically accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The Renminbi business is growing rapidly, deepening financial cooperation with the mainland.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Renminbi\" instead of \"RMB,\" which is more formal and appropriate for a headline.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue as the fourth translation: the second clause is a dangling modifier.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Rapid Growth in RMB Business Deepens Financial Cooperation with the Mainland\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Very concise and impactful. Uses a strong verb \"deepens\" and maintains parallel structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The Mainland\" is slightly more formal than \"mainland,\" and the headline lacks a subject, which may be less clear to some readers.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, impactful, and grammatically sound. It should maintain the parallel structure of the original and use appropriate terminology. \"RMB\" is more commonly used in headlines than \"Renminbi,\" and \"mainland\" is more natural than \"the Mainland.\" The verb \"deepening\" is more dynamic than \"deepens\" in a headline context.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Rapid Growth in RMB Business Deepens Financial Cooperation with the Mainland\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's RMB business continued to maintain strong momentum, with significant growth recorded in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly in offshore bank lending. The RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System set a new historical high for average daily transaction volume, reaching 3.1 trillion RMB, reflecting Hong Kong's increasingly prominent role as the global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen the financial interconnectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland. The \"Three Links and Three Facilitations\" policy introduced in 2024, together with six new measures announced at the beginning of this year, have achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a 100 billion RMB trade financing liquidity facility, providing banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funding to expand RMB trade financing services and thereby support the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through the Bond Connect \"Northbound\" channel—particularly those issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks—as eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB liquidity facility, the Hong Kong Offshore Clearing Company, and offshore RMB bond repurchase operations. This innovative move enhances the appeal of onshore bonds to offshore investors and helps promote greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. We also launched the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect 2.0\" last year, achieving multiple upgrades and optimizations, including offering a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and promotion arrangements, and an expanded individual investment quota. These measures not only reinforce Hong Kong's position as the global offshore RMB business hub but also further strengthen our role as an important gateway connecting the mainland with international markets.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","en":"# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports fueled by improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle. The labor market remained robust, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. Hong Kong's stock market experienced a significant rebound, while the property market remained largely weak due to subdued market sentiment under the prolonged high-interest rate environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the proactive implementation of economic stimulus measures by Mainland China, coupled with multifaceted support for local businesses, should help bolster business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international engagement and cooperation, as well as deepen regional collaboration.\n\nThe original sentence in Traditional Chinese is concise and formal, reflecting a financial or regulatory context. It emphasizes the stability of Hong Kong's banking system, the adequacy of capital and liquidity, and the controlled nature of asset quality.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Sound\" is a standard term in financial contexts, and \"remains under control\" effectively conveys the idea of manageability. However, \"remains under control\" is slightly less formal than alternatives like \"well-controlled\" or \"manageable.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"stable\" is slightly less precise than \"sound\" or \"robust\" in financial terminology. \"Sufficiently ample\" is redundant and slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Robust\" is a strong and appropriate term for the banking system. \"Well-controlled\" is a natural and formal expression. However, the structure \"the overall asset quality is well-controlled\" is slightly less parallel than the original sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Robust\" is appropriate, and \"well-maintained\" is a good choice for \"可控.\" However, the structure \"overall asset quality is well-maintained\" is slightly less parallel to the original sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Robust\" is appropriate, and \"manageable\" is a good synonym for \"可控.\" However, \"the overall quality of assets remains manageable\" is slightly less formal than \"well-controlled\" or \"under control.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Sound\" is appropriate, and \"manageable\" is a good choice. The phrase \"both capital and liquidity positions being ample\" is slightly more complex than necessary and less parallel to the original sentence.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise financial terminology, and ensure parallel structure and fluency. \"Sound\" or \"robust\" are both suitable for describing the banking system, but \"sound\" is more commonly used in official financial reports. \"Ample\" is concise and accurate for describing capital and liquidity. \"Well-controlled\" is a natural and formal expression for \"可控.\" The structure should mirror the original sentence for clarity and parallelism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system remains sound, with ample capital and liquidity, and overall asset quality remains well-controlled.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical developments, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, but then strengthened for the remainder of the year. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Banking System Stability\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to a heading or title about the stability of the banking system. The junior translators have provided several variations, but none fully capture the nuance and formality of the original.\nTranslation 1: \"#BankingSystemStable\" is overly condensed and lacks proper spacing and punctuation, making it unsuitable for formal or professional contexts.\nTranslation 2: \"# Banking System Stability\" is more readable but uses a hashtag unnecessarily, which may not be appropriate unless the context is social media or a specific platform.\nTranslation 3: \"Banking system stability\" is concise and grammatically correct, but it lacks the emphasis and formality that the original title implies.\nTranslation 4: Identical to Translation 3, so it suffers from the same issues.\nTranslation 5: \"Banking system stable\" is grammatically incorrect in this context. \"Stable\" is an adjective and cannot function as a noun in this structure.\nTranslation 6: \"Banking System Stability\" is the most accurate and formal translation, with proper capitalization and structure. However, it lacks the hashtag, which may be important depending on the context.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should maintain the formality and clarity of the original while adhering to English grammar and punctuation rules. It should also consider the appropriate use of punctuation and formatting based on the intended context.\nBanking System Stability\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey its actions in supporting SMEs, ensuring banking stability, and promoting fintech.\n- The use of terms like \"risk-based supervision,\" \"contingency planning,\" \"regulatory guidance,\" and \"operational resilience\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The term \"Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox\" is correctly translated in most versions, though some use \"Generative AI Sandbox\" for brevity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is incorrect and may confuse readers.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"safeguarded\" instead of \"ensured\" or \"supported,\" which may slightly alter the nuance. Also, \"network defense resilience\" is less commonly used than \"cyber resilience\" or \"cybersecurity resilience.\"\n- **Verb Tense and Nuance:** The use of \"has launched\" in one translation introduces a present perfect tense that is not reflected in the original text, which uses past tense.\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** \"Operational soundness\" is less idiomatic than \"operational resilience\" in this context. Similarly, \"cybersecurity robustness\" is less standard than \"cyber resilience\" or \"cybersecurity resilience.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct full name of the institution is used consistently: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use standard and commonly accepted terms such as \"cyber resilience\" or \"cybersecurity resilience\" instead of \"network defense resilience\" or \"cybersecurity robustness.\"\n- Maintain consistent verb tenses and avoid unnecessary variations such as \"has launched\" unless the original text implies an ongoing action.\n- Use \"fintech\" as a standard abbreviation for \"financial technology\" where appropriate, but ensure clarity in the first mention.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and ensured the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided regulatory guidance and supported the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the adoption of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including the \"Generative AI Sandbox.\"\n\nThe original text outlines several initiatives by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aimed at enhancing consumer protection in the banking sector. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"Smart Secure Savings\" and \"Credit Reporting Information Exchange,\" which may not be the official English names of the initiatives. The translation is grammatically sound but lacks precision in terminology.\n**Translation 2** correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0\" and \"SmartSafe Deposit.\" However, \"CreditLink\" may not be the official name of the service. The translation is fluent and accurate in most areas.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2, with the addition of \"offered by banks\" and \"Credit Information Link.\" It is accurate and fluent, though \"Credit Information Link\" may not be the official name.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Code of Practice\" instead of \"Charter\" and \"Smart Secure Storage,\" which may not be the correct name. It also uses \"Credit Information Express,\" which may not be the official name. The translation is grammatically correct but lacks precision in terminology.\n**Translation 5** is similar to Translation 4, with \"SmartSafe\" and \"Credit Information Express.\" It is fluent but again may not use the correct official names for the initiatives.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Consumer Protection Charter 2.0\" and \"Smart Banking,\" which may not be the correct names. It also uses \"virtual asset activities\" and \"virtual banks,\" which may not be the exact terms used in the original text. The translation is fluent but lacks precision in terminology.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is essential to use the correct official names for the initiatives, ensure grammatical accuracy, and maintain fluency. The correct names for the initiatives are \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0,\" \"SmartSafe,\" and \"Credit Information Link.\" The term \"virtual asset\" should be used with caution, as the original text refers to \"digital asset-related activities.\" The term \"digital banks\" is more appropriate than \"virtual banks.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced the \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0,\" \"SmartSafe,\" and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks, to enhance consumer protection in the banking sector. In addition, the HKMA has provided guidelines for banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services, and has introduced an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions, working closely with the industry. The HKMA has also issued guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimized the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program, relaxed several restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit data services to \"Credit Information Link.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and structure that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the key player in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.\n- The concept of enhancing public-private partnership platforms for information exchange is consistently captured.\n- The increase in suspicious transaction reports and its impact on the confiscation of criminal proceeds is well conveyed.\n- The legislative consultation and its support are accurately reflected in all translations.\n- The use of AI for monitoring suspicious activities and the optimization of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism are all present in the translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"vital role\" while others use \"important role.\" While both are acceptable, \"vital\" may be more appropriate in the context of a regulatory authority's role.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use \"thereby enabling more effective seizure of criminal proceeds\" while others use \"leading to more effective confiscation of proceeds of crime.\" Both are correct, but \"confiscation\" is more commonly used in legal and regulatory contexts.\n- **Consistency:** The term \"authorized payment fraud\" appears in some translations, while others use \"payment fraud.\" The original Chinese does not specify \"authorized,\" so it may be better to omit it unless it is a critical term.\n- **Structure:** Some translations use \"the consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate information sharing among banks\" while others use \"the consultation on legal amendments to promote information sharing among banks.\" \"Legislative amendments\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"the Monetary Authority\" in one translation is inconsistent with the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" used in others. Consistency in naming is important for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"vital role\" to emphasize the importance of the HKMA's function.\n- Use \"confiscation\" instead of \"seizure\" for consistency with legal terminology.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"HKMA\" and avoid variations like \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- Remove \"authorized\" from \"authorized payment fraud\" unless it is explicitly stated in the original text.\n- Use \"legislative amendments\" for precision.\n- Ensure parallel structure in the final sentence for clarity and flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a vital role in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Through enhanced information exchange and collaboration on the public-private partnership platform, the number of suspicious transaction reports has significantly increased, thereby enabling more effective confiscation of proceeds of crime. The consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate information sharing among banks has received widespread support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes. In addition, the HKMA has issued guidelines to banks on the application of artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious activities and to prevent and stop payment fraud, while also optimizing the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) progress in implementing international regulatory standards and improvements to the Deposit Protection Scheme. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice, phrasing, and emphasis that affect the overall quality.\nTranslation 1 is clear and accurate, using \"enhanced\" and \"protection for depositors\" which are natural in English. It avoids redundancy by not repeating \"Hong Kong\" unnecessarily.\nTranslation 2 and 3 are nearly identical, with \"optimized\" used instead of \"enhanced.\" While \"optimized\" is not incorrect, \"enhanced\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts and may be more natural for this type of text.\nTranslation 4 uses \"significant\" instead of \"good\" and \"various\" instead of \"several.\" While these are acceptable, \"good progress\" is more in line with the original Chinese, which uses \"良好進展.\" \"Significant\" may imply a greater degree of progress than intended.\nTranslation 5 uses \"optimized multiple areas\" and \"depositor protection.\" The phrasing is slightly more concise, but \"multiple areas\" is less precise than \"several aspects.\"\nTranslation 6 uses \"in Hong Kong\" after \"implementing international regulatory standards,\" which is redundant since the HKMA is based in Hong Kong. It also uses \"Deposit Insurance Scheme\" instead of \"Deposit Protection Scheme,\" which may be a minor terminology discrepancy.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would retain the clarity and natural phrasing of Translation 1, while incorporating the precision of \"several aspects\" and avoiding redundancy. It should also use \"enhanced\" rather than \"optimized\" for consistency with regulatory language.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including those relating to capital adequacy and disclosure. In addition, several aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to ensure the credibility of its resolution framework, including implementing resolution standards, requiring banks to update financial contracts with counterparties, and making progress in developing resolution strategies and enhancing execution capabilities.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly conveys the meaning of the original text. The structure is clear and the terminology is appropriate.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This translation uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. The term \"early closure\" is not used in the original and may be misleading. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"HKMA\" correctly and conveys the meaning clearly. However, the phrase \"by implementing resolution standards, requiring banks to update...\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"thereby reducing\" effectively to show the result of the action. The only minor issue is the use of \"preferred resolution strategies for banks\" which is slightly less direct than \"banks' preferred resolution strategies.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"thereby reducing\" effectively and \"formulating\" is a good choice for \"制定.\" The structure is clear and the terminology is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate but uses \"resolution mechanisms\" instead of \"resolution mechanism,\" which is plural and not consistent with the original. It also uses \"enhancing resolution implementation capabilities\" instead of \"enhancing resolution execution capabilities,\" which is slightly different in meaning.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently, accurately reflect the original meaning, and use natural English structure. It should avoid unnecessary changes in terminology and maintain the original's formal tone. The use of \"thereby\" effectively shows the causal relationship between actions and outcomes. The phrase \"developing banks' preferred resolution strategies\" is more direct and natural than \"formulating\" or \"for banks.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work to ensure the credibility of the resolution mechanism, implementing resolution standards that require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties, thereby reducing the risk of disorderly early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing obstacles to resolution feasibility, and enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe original title, \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位,\" is a heading that introduces a topic about Hong Kong's role in global finance. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in formatting and terminology that can be refined for clarity and consistency.\nThe first junior translator included a hashtag (#) in the translation, which matches the original format. However, in English, hashtags are typically used in social media or informal contexts, and may not be appropriate for a formal title. The second through fourth junior translators omitted the hashtag, which is more suitable for a formal or academic context. The fifth junior translator used \"Centre\" with a 'C,' which is a British English spelling, while the sixth used \"center\" with an's,' which is American English. Both are acceptable, but for consistency with global financial terminology, \"center\" is more commonly used in international contexts.\nThe use of \"status\" is appropriate, but \"position\" or \"role\" could also be considered as alternatives. However, \"status\" is widely understood and commonly used in this context. The capitalization of \"Hong Kong\" is correct, and the use of \"International Financial Center\" is standard in financial literature.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the hashtag should be omitted for a formal tone, and \"center\" should be used with an's' to align with American English conventions, which are more widely used in international financial discourse. The title should also be capitalized consistently, as it is a heading.\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately mention the collaboration with mainland and Hong Kong authorities.\n- The key initiatives—such as optimizing the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" expanding eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements, and optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Connect\"—are consistently mentioned across translations.\n- The final sentences about reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a gateway and offshore RMB hub are well-conveyed in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 4** contains significant errors, including misnaming the \"Wealth Management Connect\" as \"Wealth Management Connect scheme\" and incorrectly referring to the \"Southbound Trading Link\" instead of \"Northbound Swap Connect.\" These are factual inaccuracies that compromise the translation.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"reinforce\" and \"consolidate\" in the final sentence, which is slightly repetitive and less idiomatic than \"strengthen\" and \"consolidate.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"initiatives\" in the final sentence, which is slightly less direct than \"measures\" or \"efforts.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"interconnectivity\" instead of \"connectivity,\" which is a minor but unnecessary variation.\n- **Translation 6** is the most fluent and grammatically precise, with a natural flow and consistent terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" on first mention.\n- Maintain consistent terminology, such as \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\n- Use precise and idiomatic language, such as \"deepen and expand\" rather than \"further deepen and expand\" or \"jointly deepen and expand.\"\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and natural sentence structure, avoiding redundancy or awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with relevant mainland and Hong Kong authorities to introduce a series of measures aimed at deepening and expanding the connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland China's financial markets. These measures include optimizing the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements and the \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" as well as optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" itself. These initiatives will help strengthen Hong Kong's role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) progress in strengthening Hong Kong's financial platform, promoting its services, hosting major events, and participating in global financial governance.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate translation of key terms such as \"bond issuance,\" \"asset and wealth management,\" \"green and sustainable finance,\" and \"corporate treasury centers.\"\n- Proper use of the HKMA acronym and consistent reference to the organization.\n- Effective rendering of the phrase \"positive ripple effect,\" which is a common metaphor in financial and economic contexts.\n- Clear and logical sentence structure that mirrors the original Chinese text.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"financial platform\" while others use \"financial hub\" or \"financial center.\" \"Financial hub\" is more commonly used in English to describe Hong Kong's role in the global financial system.\n- The phrase \"intensified its marketing efforts\" appears in several translations, but \"market outreach\" or \"market promotion\" may be more appropriate in the context of promoting financial services.\n- The use of \"ensuring a full understanding\" or \"enabling them to fully understand\" is slightly passive; \"helping them fully understand\" or \"ensuring they fully understand\" may be more direct.\n- Some translations use \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" while others use \"central banks and regulatory bodies.\" \"Bodies\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- The phrase \"created a positive ripple effect\" is well used, but \"generated a positive ripple effect\" or \"produced a positive ripple effect\" may be slightly more natural in formal writing.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and formality of the original while using the most natural and commonly accepted phrasing in English financial discourse.\nThe improved translation would use \"financial hub\" to describe Hong Kong's role, \"market outreach\" to describe the HKMA's efforts, and \"regulatory bodies\" to refer to the organizations it participates in. It would also ensure consistency in verb usage and maintain a formal yet fluent tone.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made good progress in consolidating the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial hub, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centers. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market outreach efforts toward overseas and mainland stakeholders, helping them fully understand the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system and the opportunities it offers. The successful hosting of the third \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and other major events not only enhanced Hong Kong's image as a leading international financial center but also generated a positive ripple effect. In addition, the HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory bodies, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market development.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) progress in the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, particularly in central bank digital currency and data infrastructure, and its collaboration with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to interconnect Hong Kong's \"Faster Payments System\" with mainland China's interbank online payment clearing system for cross-border payments.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Faster Payments System\" correctly and \"interconnection\" is appropriate. However, \"Concurrently\" is slightly less natural than \"On the other hand\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The term \"Overseas Remittance Express\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Faster Payments System\" or \"FPS.\" The phrase \"cross-border clearing system for online payments in mainland China\" is awkward and less precise than \"interbank online payment clearing system.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very strong. It uses \"interoperability\" and \"Fast Payment System\" appropriately. The structure is clear and the language is natural. However, \"aiming to achieve cross-border payment capabilities\" is slightly wordy compared to \"facilitating cross-border payments.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Similar to the second, it incorrectly uses \"Overseas Remittance Express\" and \"cross-bank online payment system\" is less precise than \"interbank online payment clearing system.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"interoperability\" and \"Fast Payment System (FPS)\" correctly. The phrase \"aiming to realize cross-border payments\" is slightly less direct than \"facilitating cross-border payments.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version. It uses \"Faster Payment System\" and \"interconnection\" correctly. However, \"online payment interbank clearing system\" is slightly awkward compared to \"interbank online payment clearing system.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct terminology (\"Faster Payments System\" or \"FPS\"), use natural English phrasing, and accurately reflect the original meaning. It should also avoid awkward or overly wordy expressions. Based on the above, the third and fifth translations are the strongest, with the third being slightly more concise and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress across various areas of its \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the HKMA is closely collaborating with the People's Bank of China to advance the interoperability between Hong Kong's \"Fast Payment System\" and mainland China's interbank online payment clearing system, aiming to facilitate cross-border payments.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nThe original text provides a concise summary of the 2024 global financial market performance, highlighting stable economic growth, central bank rate adjustments, and the performance of the Exchange Fund. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, vocabulary choice, and attention to detail.\n**Translation Review:**\n- **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"generally well\" and \"major central banks gradually lowering policy interest rates\" effectively. It correctly uses \"HKD 218.8 billion\" and \"investment return rate of 5.2%.\" However, \"Exchange Fund\" is used without clarification, which may be ambiguous to some readers.\n- **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, but uses \"steady\" instead of \"stable\" and \"return on investment\" instead of \"investment return rate.\" Both are acceptable, but \"return on investment\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 3** is nearly identical to Translation 1, but uses \"HK$218.8 billion\" with the dollar sign. This is acceptable but less formal than using \"HKD\" in full.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"fairly well\" instead of \"generally well\" and \"HK$21.88 billion\" with an incorrect decimal placement (21.88 instead of 218.8). This is a significant error that affects the accuracy of the figure.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is more precise but slightly wordier. It also uses \"policy rates\" instead of \"policy interest rates,\" which is acceptable but less specific.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"relatively well\" and \"successively lowering policy interest rates as inflation gradually eased.\" These are slightly more formal and precise, but \"relatively well\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"大致良好.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use standard financial terminology. It should also maintain the original's tone and clarity. \"Exchange Fund\" is the standard term used in Hong Kong, so it should be retained. \"Return on investment\" is more commonly used than \"investment return rate.\" The figure \"HKD 218.8 billion\" is more formal and precise than using the dollar sign. The phrase \"as inflation eased\" is more natural than \"as inflation gradually eased.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe global financial markets performed generally well in 2024, with major economies recording stable growth and major central banks gradually lowering policy interest rates as inflation eased. Against this backdrop, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HKD 218.8 billion, with a return on investment of 5.2%.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts in promoting asset diversification and responsible investment, and provides a performance metric for the Long-Term Growth Fund. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (though some use \"Monetary Authority\" without \"Hong Kong,\" which may be less precise).\n- The term \"annualized internal rate of return\" is consistently used, which is the correct financial terminology.\n- The phrase \"since the commencement of investments in 2009\" is well-conveyed in most translations, accurately reflecting the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"Long-Term Growth Fund\" with a capital \"F,\" which may be inconsistent with the original's \"長期增長組合\" (long-term growth portfolio), which is more likely a portfolio than a fund.\n- The second and third translations use \"long-term growth portfolio\" without capitalization, which is more consistent with the original.\n- The fifth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the entity mentioned in the original text.\n- The third and sixth translations use \"strive for\" and \"strive to promote,\" which are slightly less formal than \"continue to be committed to\" or \"continue to strive to promote.\"\n- The phrase \"since the commencement of investment in 2009\" in the fourth and sixth translations uses \"investment\" instead of \"investments,\" which is grammatically less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and accuracy.\n- Use \"long-term growth portfolio\" with lowercase unless it is a proper noun.\n- Use \"continue to be committed to\" for a more formal and natural tone.\n- Use \"investments\" (plural) for grammatical accuracy.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and capitalization.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be committed to promoting asset diversification and responsible investment. Meanwhile, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 11.2% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\n# Organizational Functions\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the official tone of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- The use of \"maintains close contact\/communication\" is appropriate and consistent with the original.\n- The phrase \"through various channels\" is well translated and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The goal of \"enhancing public understanding\" is accurately reflected in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the HKMA\" instead of the full name \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may be less formal and less appropriate in an official context.\n- The second and fifth translations use \"operations\" instead of \"work,\" which is slightly more technical and may not fully capture the broader scope of the HKMA's activities.\n- The third and fifth translations use \"community\" instead of \"society,\" which is a minor but notable difference in terminology. \"Society\" is more inclusive and aligns better with the original.\n- The sixth translation uses \"The Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could be ambiguous or misleading.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the full name \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" should be used for clarity and formality. \"Society\" is more appropriate than \"community\" in this context, as it reflects a broader engagement with the public. \"Work\" is more general and inclusive than \"operations,\" which may be too narrow. The phrase \"enhance public understanding\" is clear and natural, but adding \"of its policies and work\" ensures that the subject is clearly tied to the HKMA.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible, responsive, and professional team, while upholding strict fiscal discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to address changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first junior translator used \"# October 25th,\" which includes a hashtag. This may be appropriate in certain contexts, such as social media or headings, but it is unnecessary in a straightforward translation of a date. The second junior translator wrote \"# October 25,\" omitting the \"th\" and including the hashtag. This is less accurate and less natural in standard English date formatting. The third through sixth junior translators all used \"October 25th\" without the hashtag, which is the most natural and standard way to express the date in English.\nThe most notable issue across the translations is the use of the hashtag (#), which is not standard in formal or neutral English date expressions. Additionally, the second junior translator omitted the \"th\" in \"25th,\" which is incorrect in English date formatting. The rest of the translations are accurate and natural.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to follow standard English conventions for writing dates. In formal or neutral contexts, \"October 25th\" is the most appropriate and natural expression. The hashtag should be omitted unless the context specifically requires it, such as in social media or as a label in a list.\nTherefore, the best translation is simply \"October 25th.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) decision to expand the number of primary liquidity providers in the offshore RMB market and increase the total liquidity available under the arrangement. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and numerical precision.\n**Translation 1** uses \"RMB 18 billion\" and \"RMB 20 billion,\" which is incorrect since the original text specifies 180 billion and 200 billion yuan. It also uses \"provision arrangement\" instead of \"provider arrangement,\" which is slightly off in terminology.\n**Translation 2** correctly uses \"18 billion yuan\" and \"20 billion yuan,\" but the phrase \"primary liquidity provider arrangement\" is more accurate than \"provision arrangement.\" It also omits \"offshore\" before \"RMB market,\" which is important for clarity.\n**Translation 3** is very close to the original in terms of structure and terminology, using \"Renminbi liquidity that can be provided\" and \"primary liquidity provider arrangement.\" However, it uses \"Renminbi\" instead of \"RMB\" in some places, which is less common in financial contexts.\n**Translation 4** has a critical error: it translates \"180 billion yuan\" as \"180 billion yuan\" but mistakenly writes \"180 billion yuan\" as \"180 billion yuan\" and \"200 billion yuan\" as \"200 billion yuan.\" This is a numerical error that could mislead readers.\n**Translation 5** is accurate in terms of numbers and terminology, using \"RMB\" consistently and including \"offshore RMB market in Hong Kong.\" However, it repeats \"primary liquidity provider arrangement\" twice, which is slightly redundant.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 5 but uses \"that can be provided\" instead of \"available,\" which is more precise in the context of liquidity provision.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Ensure numerical accuracy: the original text specifies 180 billion and 200 billion yuan, not 18 or 20 billion.\n- Use consistent terminology: \"RMB\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"Renminbi.\"\n- Maintain clarity and conciseness: avoid redundancy and ensure that the structure is natural in English.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has increased the number of primary liquidity providers in the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong to 11 banks, and raised the total amount of RMB liquidity that can be provided under the primary liquidity provider arrangement from 180 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan.\n\n# Banking System\n\n# February 7th\nThe original text is simply a date written in Chinese format, \"# 2月7日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first and sixth translators used \"# February 7\", while the second, third, fourth, and fifth used \"# February 7th\" or \"February 7th\" without the hashtag.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" is consistent with the original format, so it should be retained in the translation. However, in English, dates are typically written with the day followed by the month, and the ordinal indicator \"th\" is commonly used for days 3 through 20, 23 through 30, and 31. Therefore, \"February 7th\" is more appropriate than \"February 7\" in formal or standard English writing.\nThe translations that include the hashtag are more faithful to the original format, but the use of \"February 7th\" is more natural in English. The best translation would be \"# February 7th\", which maintains the original format while using the correct English date format.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a report on the digitalization of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation, including its current status and future outlook. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"anti-money laundering regulations.\" However, the title is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is incorrect. The correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, \"Digitalization Progress of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Regulatory Measures\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" correctly but omits the full name in parentheses. The title is concise but lacks the full scope of the original. \"Supervision\" is used instead of \"regulation,\" which is slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses the full name with the acronym in parentheses, and the title is well-structured. \"Digitalisation\" is appropriate, and \"supervision\" is used consistently with the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Similar to the fourth, but \"outlook\" is used instead of \"future outlook,\" which is slightly less precise. The title is concise but lacks the full scope of the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Digitalization Process of Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,\" which is slightly less precise than \"Digitalization of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Regulation.\" Also, \"supervision\" is used instead of \"regulation.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full name of the authority with the acronym in parentheses, maintain the precise terminology used in the original, and ensure the title accurately reflects the content of the report. \"Digitalization of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Regulation: Current Status and Future Outlook\" is the most accurate and natural phrasing. The verb \"published\" is appropriate, and \"detailing how to strengthen and modernize anti-money laundering regulation\" is clear and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the report titled \"Digitalization of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Regulation: Current Status and Future Outlook,\" detailing how to strengthen and modernize anti-money laundering regulation.\n\n# February 20th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, often seen in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting that could be refined for consistency and natural English usage.\nThe first, third, and fourth translators used \"February 20th,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English. The second and sixth translators used \"February 20,\" which is also acceptable but lacks the ordinal suffix \"th.\" The fifth translator also used \"February 20th,\" aligning with the most natural English convention.\nIn English, it is common to use the ordinal suffix \"th\" when writing out full dates in formal or written contexts, especially when the date is used as a heading or title. Therefore, \"February 20th\" is the most appropriate and natural choice. Additionally, the use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text may be intended as a heading or label, which is often retained in English translations when used in similar contexts. However, in this case, since the original text is minimal and only contains the date, the \"#\" symbol may be redundant or unnecessary in the English version unless it serves a specific formatting purpose.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"February 20th,\" which is both grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate for the context.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued two notices to banks, one providing guidance on the sale and distribution of tokenized products and the other on the provision of digital asset custody services.\n\n# February 28\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate in conveying the core content of the original text. However, there are notable inconsistencies and errors that affect clarity, fluency, and precision. Below is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the issuer of the guidelines.\n- The main revisions are all listed and described with reasonable accuracy.\n- The use of \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio\" is consistent across most translations, which is the correct financial terminology.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, which is appropriate for listing revisions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical Errors:** Several translations incorrectly state the property values as HK$30 million or HK$35 million instead of the correct HK$3 million and HK$3.5 million. This is a critical error that could mislead readers.\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"self-occupied\" while others use \"owner-occupied\" or \"self-used.\" While these are all acceptable, \"self-occupied\" is more commonly used in financial regulatory contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"approved based on the 'asset level'\" or \"based on 'asset levels'.\" A more concise phrasing like \"based on asset levels\" is preferable.\n- **Tense and Voice:** Some translations use passive voice unnecessarily, which can make the text feel less direct. For example, \"the stress test requirement for property mortgage loans assuming a 200 basis point increase in interest rates\" is clearer than \"the stress test requirement for property mortgage loans assuming a 200 basis point increase in interest rates was suspended.\"\n- **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness:** The term \"countercyclical macroprudential measures\" is correctly used, but some translations omit the hyphen in \"macro-prudential,\" which is not standard in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Correct the numerical values to HK$3 million and HK$3.5 million.\n- Use consistent terminology such as \"self-occupied\" and \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\"\n- Simplify and streamline phrasing to avoid redundancy.\n- Use active voice where appropriate to enhance clarity and directness.\n- Ensure proper hyphenation and standard financial terminology.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued guidelines to banks to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures applicable to property mortgage loans and other related regulatory requirements. The main revisions include: (1) increasing the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for self-occupied residential properties valued at HK$3 million or below to 70%, for self-occupied residential properties valued at HK$3.5 million or above to 60%, and for non-self-occupied residential properties to 60%; (2) increasing the LTV ratio cap for non-residential properties to 70%; (3) increasing the LTV ratio cap for property mortgage loans based on asset levels to 60%; and (4) suspending the stress test requirement for property mortgage loans assuming a 200 basis point increase in interest rates.\n\n# February 28\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding the extension of the application period for two specific credit guarantee products under a government scheme. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the core message: the extension of the application period to the end of March 2026.\n- The use of quotation marks around the product names is consistent across translations.\n- The term \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" is used appropriately in most translations, which is the standard term in official contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Credit Guarantee Product\" while others use \"Loan Guarantee Product.\" The original uses the term \"信貸擔保產品,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Credit Guarantee Product\" rather than \"Loan Guarantee Product.\" \"Loan\" implies a specific type of financial product, whereas \"Credit\" is broader and more appropriate in this context.\n- **Stylistic Choice:** The use of \"Eighty Percent\" and \"Ninety Percent\" in some translations is overly literal and less natural in formal English. Numerical expressions like \"80%\" are more commonly used in official documents.\n- **Scheme vs. Program:** The original refers to the scheme as \"中小企融資擔保計劃,\" which is best translated as \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.\" The term \"Program\" is less common in this context and may be considered less formal or less precise.\n- **Punctuation and Spacing:** Some translations use inconsistent spacing around the word \"under\" and quotation marks, which can affect readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Credit Guarantee Product\" consistently to align with the original terminology.\n- Use numerical percentages (e.g., \"80%\") rather than written-out numbers for clarity and formality.\n- Maintain the term \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" for consistency and accuracy.\n- Ensure consistent punctuation and spacing for a polished appearance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe application period for the \"80% Credit Guarantee Product\" and \"90% Credit Guarantee Product\" under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has been extended to the end of March 2026.\n\n# March 28\n\nThe original text outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborating with a specific mechanism to support SMEs through nine measures. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. However, it uses \"not requiring mortgage customers who are behind on payments to repay early,\" which may mislead readers into thinking the policy applies only to delinquent customers, whereas the original likely refers to those who are making timely payments.\n**Translation 2** uses \"making timely repayments\" correctly, which aligns with the original. However, it introduces \"sustainable development,\" which is slightly more formal than the original's \"持續發展.\" It also adds \"in the banking sector\" to the mechanism's name, which is not in the original.\n**Translation 3** is very close to the original, using \"sustaining their development\" and \"interest and fee reductions.\" However, \"repay their loans in advance on schedule\" is awkward and unclear.\n**Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the HKMA, which is a critical error. It also uses \"grace period\" instead of \"transition period,\" which may not be the best term in this context.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, using \"timely repayments\" and \"continued development.\" It also correctly names the mechanism as \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism.\"\n**Translation 6** uses \"pay penalties for early repayment,\" which is not the same as the original's \"不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款.\" It also uses \"credit facilities\" instead of \"credit limits,\" which is slightly different in meaning.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"timely repayments\" to accurately reflect the original.\n- Use \"transition period\" rather than \"grace period.\"\n- Avoid adding unnecessary terms like \"sustainable\" or \"in the banking sector\" unless explicitly stated.\n- Ensure clarity in phrasing, such as \"not requiring mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to prepay their loans.\"\n**Best Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" has introduced nine measures to support SMEs in obtaining bank financing and assist their continued development. These include not requiring mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to prepay their loans; adjusting credit limits to provide customers with a minimum six-month transition period; and actively considering offering interest and fee reductions to SMEs in need.\n\n# April 1\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 4月1日,\" where the \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or label. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English, with the primary difference being the use of \"April 1\" versus \"April 1st\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify the date as April 1.\n- The use of \"April 1st\" is grammatically correct in British English, though \"April 1\" is more commonly used in American English.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in the first and fifth translations is consistent with the original format.\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of \"April 1st\" may be unnecessarily formal or pedantic in contexts where \"April 1\" is more standard.\n- The inconsistency in the use of the \"#\" symbol may be confusing, as it is not typically used in English date formats.\nImprovements:\n- To maintain consistency with the original format, the \"#\" symbol should be retained.\n- To ensure natural English usage, \"April 1\" is preferable to \"April 1st\" in most contexts.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use \"April 1\" for the date.\n\nIntroduce a 1% positive neutral countercyclical capital buffer.\n\n# April 10\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality and professionalism of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association or HKAB).\n- The term \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0\" is consistently translated, though with slight variations in phrasing.\n- The translations all capture the main idea: the expansion of the Charter's scope to help the public prevent credit card fraud and other digital scams.\n- The number of participating institutions (over 230) and the support from government and regulatory bodies are accurately conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The name of the organization \"香港銀行公會\" is translated as \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" in some translations and \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" in others. The former is more commonly used and recognized in official contexts.\n- **Title of the Charter:** Some translations use \"Charter\" while others use \"Pledge\" or \"Protection Against Fraud Charter.\" The original text uses \"約章,\" which is best translated as \"Charter.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use semicolons and commas in a way that disrupts the flow of the sentence. For example, the use of a semicolon in \"Charter 2.0 has received full support...; over 230 financial institutions...\" is less natural in English than using a comma or restructuring the sentence.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"Charter\" unnecessarily, such as \"The 'Charter 2.0' has received full support...\" which can be simplified to \"Charter 2.0 has received full support...\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the most recognized and official name for the organization: \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\"\n- Maintain consistency in the title of the Charter: \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0.\"\n- Improve sentence flow by using more natural punctuation and sentence structure.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"Charter 2.0\" without quotation marks unless necessary for emphasis.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association have launched the \"Consumer Protection Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0,\" expanding the scope of the Charter to further assist the public in preventing credit card fraud and other digital scams. Charter 2.0 has received full support from multiple government departments, financial regulators, and relevant organizations, with over 230 financial institutions and merchants from different industries participating.\n\n# April 26\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese for marking dates, often seen in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are technically correct but differ slightly in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators used \"April 26th,\" which is the standard way to write the date in English when including the ordinal suffix. The second, fifth, and fourth translators used \"April 26\" or \"# April 26,\" which are also acceptable, though the use of the hashtag (#) is not standard in formal English writing unless it's part of a specific context like social media or a list.\nThe most neutral and universally acceptable format is \"April 26,\" which avoids the ordinal suffix and the hashtag, making it suitable for both formal and informal contexts. It is concise and aligns with common date formatting in English without unnecessary embellishments.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative, FiNETech, aimed at promoting financial technology applications through collaboration among various financial and tech entities. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Translation Review:**\n- **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"financial technology\" and \"collaboration arrangements.\" However, it uses \"the first FiNETech event\" which is slightly less formal than \"the inaugural FiNETech event.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"fintech\" instead of \"financial technology,\" which is acceptable but less formal. It also uses \"insurtech\" and \"collaboratively explore,\" which are good choices.\n- **Translation 3** is well-structured, using \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"the inaugural FiNETech gathering.\" It uses \"wealthtech\" and \"insurtech,\" which are concise but may be less familiar to some readers.\n- **Translation 4** is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"the first FiNETech event\" and \"jointly explore,\" which are both appropriate.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"collaborative opportunities\" instead of \"collaborative arrangements,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 6** is accurate and well-structured, using \"the inaugural FiNETech event\" and \"collaborative initiatives.\" It also uses \"insurtech\" and \"green technology,\" which are appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full name of the HKMA with the acronym in parentheses, as it is a formal institution. It should also use \"the inaugural FiNETech event\" for formality and clarity. The terms \"wealth technology\" and \"insurance technology\" can be abbreviated to \"wealthtech\" and \"insurtech\" for conciseness, but should be used consistently. \"Distributed ledger technology\" is the standard term and should be used as is. The phrase \"advanced collaborative arrangements\" is appropriate, but \"initiatives\" may be more dynamic.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the FiNETech series to promote the application of financial technology. The inaugural FiNETech event brought together approximately 100 banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and technology enterprises to jointly explore advanced collaborative initiatives in wealthtech, insurtech, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology.\n\n# May 3rd\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag. All translations provided by the junior translators are essentially correct in terms of date formatting. However, there are minor differences in formatting that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first three translations omit the hashtag, which is present in the original text. The fourth, fifth, and sixth translations retain the hashtag, which is more faithful to the original. However, in English, the use of a hashtag before a date is not standard unless it's being used for a specific purpose, such as a social media post or a section heading. In this context, it's unclear whether the hashtag is meant to denote a section, a title, or simply a stylistic choice.\nGiven that the original text is brief and the context is not provided, the most neutral and accurate translation would be to retain the hashtag as it appears in the original, while ensuring the date is correctly formatted in English. Therefore, the best possible translation would be \"# May 3rd,\" which preserves the original structure while adhering to standard English date formatting.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) release of a classification system aimed at guiding the development of green and sustainable finance and facilitating the flow of green capital. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with slight variations in terminology and phrasing.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate identification of the HKMA as the issuing body and the general intent of the document. All versions correctly convey the purpose of the classification system: to assist the industry in making informed decisions and to promote the flow of green capital. The use of terms like \"green and sustainable finance\" and \"green capital\" is consistent and appropriate.\nHowever, there are notable differences in terminology. The original Chinese text uses the term “分類目錄,” which is best translated as \"Classification Directory\" or \"Classification Catalogue.\" Some translations use \"Taxonomy,\" which is more commonly associated with scientific classification systems and may not be the most appropriate term in this context. \"Directory\" or \"Catalogue\" better reflects the nature of a classification system used in financial contexts.\nAdditionally, the verb used to describe the HKMA's action varies: \"released,\" \"published,\" and \"issued.\" While all are acceptable, \"published\" is the most neutral and commonly used term in official contexts, making it the most appropriate choice.\nThe phrase \"make informed decisions when developing green and sustainable finance\" is slightly repetitive and could be more concise. A more natural phrasing would be \"make informed decisions in developing green and sustainable finance.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"published\" as the verb, \"Classification Directory\" as the title, and a more concise phrasing for the purpose of the document.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the \"Hong Kong Sustainable Finance Classification Directory\" to enable the industry to make informed decisions in developing green and sustainable finance and to promote the flow of green capital.\n\n# June 21\n\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**金管局向銀行發出指引，加強保護消費者防範偽冒來電。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Supervisory Agency has issued guidelines to banks to strengthen protection for consumers against fraudulent phone calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate in meaning, correct grammar, and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" is not the official English name of the institution in Hong Kong. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to banks to enhance consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the institution, uses \"enhance\" which is a natural synonym for \"strengthen,\" and uses \"fraudulent calls\" which is concise and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The verb \"has issued\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but not incorrect.  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct name, natural phrasing, and accurate meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"issued\" without a time marker (e.g., \"has issued\") is slightly less precise, though still acceptable.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidance to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct name, natural phrasing, and use of \"guidance\" is appropriate in regulatory contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Guidance\" is slightly less formal than \"guidelines,\" but the difference is minimal.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to enhance consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Natural phrasing and accurate meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omission of \"Hong Kong\" in the name of the authority is a critical error, as it is not the official name.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct name, accurate meaning, and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the third translation, the use of \"issued\" without a time marker is slightly less precise.  \n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the **correct official name** of the institution: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use **\"guidelines\"** as the original text uses \"指引,\" which is more commonly translated as \"guidelines\" in regulatory contexts.\n- Use **\"strengthen\"** or **\"enhance\"** as both are acceptable, but \"strengthen\" is more direct in this context.\n- Use **\"fraudulent calls\"** as it is concise and natural in English.\n- Use **\"has issued\"** to indicate a recent or ongoing action, which is more precise than \"issued\" alone.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\n\nOn the same day, the Banking Association released a newly revised \"Voluntary Operational Guidelines for Direct Person-to-Person Telemarketing,\" optimizing guidance for the industry regarding telemarketing activities.\n\n# June 24th\n\nThe original Chinese text describes a collaborative event organized by three institutions, attended by 200 participants from various sectors, with the purpose of exchanging views on banking support for SMEs. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the three organizing bodies: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Banking Association (or its equivalents), and the Hong Kong Chinese Banking Association.\n- The event title is translated consistently as \"Banking Support for SMEs Seminar\" or similar variations.\n- The core message of the event—gathering 200 participants to exchange views on support measures and services—is preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The names of the associations vary slightly (e.g., \"Banking Association\" vs. \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" vs. \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\"). While these are all acceptable translations, using a consistent and widely recognized name (e.g., \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\") would enhance clarity and professionalism.\n- **Verb Choice:** Some translations use \"organized\" or \"hosted,\" while others use \"co-organized\" or \"jointly organized.\" \"Jointly organized\" is more precise in this context, as it emphasizes the collaborative nature of the event.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly wordy or repetitive (e.g., \"support measures and diversified services provided by banks to SMEs\"). A more concise and natural phrasing would improve readability.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"SMEs\" is standard in English business contexts, but it is worth ensuring that the full form \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" is used at least once for clarity, especially in formal or official contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a consistent and recognized name for the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n- Use \"jointly organized\" to emphasize collaboration.\n- Simplify and streamline the sentence structure for better fluency.\n- Ensure that the term \"SMEs\" is introduced with its full form for clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, and the Association of Chinese Banks in Hong Kong jointly organized the \"Banking Sector Support for SMEs Seminar,\" bringing together 200 representatives from the banking industry and chambers of commerce, as well as operators of small and medium-sized enterprises, to exchange views on the support measures and diversified services provided by the banking sector to SMEs.\n\n# June 25\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 6月25日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English, with the primary difference being the use of \"June 25\" versus \"June 25th\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in converting the date from Traditional Chinese to English. All translations correctly identify the month and day. However, there are notable weaknesses in terms of consistency and stylistic appropriateness.\nThe first junior translator used \"June 25\" without the \"th\" ordinal suffix. This is acceptable in some contexts, such as in headlines or when the date is used in a list, but it may appear less formal compared to \"June 25th.\"\nThe second through sixth junior translators used \"June 25th,\" which is the more standard and formal way to write out a date in English. However, the fourth junior translator included the \"#\" symbol, which was present in the original text. This is a point of inconsistency, as the other translations omitted it.\nIn terms of cultural appropriateness, the use of \"June 25th\" is standard in English-speaking countries. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol may be context-dependent. If the original text is part of a list or a heading, retaining the \"#\" symbol may be appropriate. However, in many English contexts, headings are often written without such symbols unless they are part of a specific formatting style.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be to use \"June 25th\" as it is the most standard and formal way to write the date in English. If the \"#\" symbol is intended to denote a heading or section, it should be retained. However, in most cases, the \"#\" symbol is not used in English date formats unless it is part of a specific style guide or formatting requirement.\nTherefore, the improved translation would be:\nJune 25th\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在「慶回歸 • 中企金融服務進社區專題講座」啟動禮上分享打擊詐騙的工作重點。**\n### Review of the Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the event name and the main action (sharing key focus areas).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Celebrating the Handover\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"Celebrating the Return\" in this context. Also, \"key focus areas\" is slightly wordy compared to \"key priorities.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key priorities\" effectively and translates \"中企\" as \"China's\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"China's Financial Services Enter the Community\" is awkward phrasing. \"Enter the community\" is not idiomatic in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Attempts to clarify \"中企\" as \"Mainland Enterprises,\" which is more precise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The event title is overly long and convoluted. \"Reaching Out to the Community\" is more natural than \"Enter the Community,\" but the overall phrasing is still too wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Special Lecture on Bringing Chinese Enterprise Financial Services into the Community,\" which is more natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Key work focus on combating fraud\" is awkwardly phrased. \"Key work focus\" is not idiomatic in English.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The event title is too vague (\"Bringing Financial Services to the Community\") and omits the specific reference to \"Chinese enterprises.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"key points of its anti-fraud efforts,\" which is concise and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"China's Financial Services Entering Communities\" is slightly awkward. \"Communities\" is plural, but the original uses \"社區\" (community), which is singular in context.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the official name of the organization: **Hong Kong Monetary Authority**.\n- Use idiomatic English for the event title, preserving the original structure but making it natural in English.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing for \"sharing the key focus areas of its efforts to combat fraud.\"\nThe phrase \"key focus areas\" is slightly wordy; \"key priorities\" or \"key points\" are better. \"Anti-fraud efforts\" is more natural than \"work on combating fraud.\"\nThe event title should be translated as:  \n**\"Celebrating the Return • Special Lecture on Chinese Enterprises' Financial Services Entering the Community\"**\nThis preserves the original structure, uses natural English phrasing, and accurately reflects the content of the event.\n---\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared the key points of its anti-fraud efforts at the launch ceremony of the \"Celebrating the Return • Special Lecture on Chinese Enterprises' Financial Services Entering the Community\" event.\n\n# June 28\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, conveying a regulatory message from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to authorized institutions regarding the cross-border transmission of credit information data. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, fluency, and accuracy.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"regulatory notices\" and \"complied with\" appropriately. However, \"should be complied with\" is slightly less natural than \"must be complied with\" or \"should comply with.\"\n**Translation 2** is concise but omits \"authorized institutions\" and uses \"regulatory provisions\" instead of \"regulatory requirements,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"regarding the pilot program\" instead of \"when conducting pilot programs,\" which is less direct.\n**Translation 3** uses \"supervisory circulars\" instead of \"regulatory notices,\" which is a minor but notable difference in terminology. \"Comply with all applicable laws and regulations\" is accurate, and the structure is clear.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and wording, using \"regulatory notices\" and \"comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\" It is fluent and accurate, with only minor stylistic differences.\n**Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"licensed institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which may not be interchangeable in this context.\n**Translation 6** uses \"regulatory circulars\" and \"cross-border transmission trials,\" which are slightly less standard than \"regulatory notices\" and \"pilot programs.\" However, the meaning is clear.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct official name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"), the appropriate term for the official communication (\"regulatory notices\"), and the correct terminology for the institutions (\"authorized institutions\"). It should also use natural phrasing such as \"must comply with\" or \"should comply with\" rather than \"should be complied with.\" The phrase \"conducting pilot programs for cross-border transmission of credit information data\" is the most accurate and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued two regulatory notices to authorized institutions, reminding the industry to comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements when conducting pilot programs for the cross-border transmission of credit information data.\n\n# July 3rd\nThe original text is simply the date \"7月3日\" (July 3rd) preceded by a hashtag symbol \"#\". The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are some minor inconsistencies in formatting.\n1. The first junior translator wrote \"July 3rd\" without the hashtag. This omits a key element of the original text.\n2. The second junior translator included the hashtag but wrote \"July 3rd\" with a space between \"July\" and \"3rd\", which is correct.\n3. The third junior translator wrote \"July3\" without a space or \"rd\" suffix, which is less standard in English date formatting.\n4. The fourth, fifth, and sixth junior translators all wrote \"July 3rd\" correctly but omitted the hashtag.\nThe hashtag is an important stylistic element in the original text, likely used for categorization or emphasis. Therefore, the best translation should include both the hashtag and the properly formatted date.\nThe most accurate and stylistically appropriate translation would be \"# July 3rd\", with a space between the hashtag and the date, as is common in English usage.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the legislative body (\"Legislative Council\") and the name of the bill (\"Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Ordinance 2024\").\n- They all mention the two-phase implementation and the effective date (October 1) and the increase in deposit protection to HK$800,000.\n- The use of \"deposit protection scheme\" or \"deposit insurance scheme\" is consistent with the intended meaning of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Deposit Insurance Scheme\" while others use \"Deposit Protection Scheme.\" The original uses \"存款保障計劃,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Deposit Protection Scheme\" or \"Deposit Insurance Scheme.\" However, \"Deposit Insurance Scheme\" is more commonly used in official contexts in Hong Kong.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"which includes raising the deposit protection amount...\" which is grammatically correct but less fluent than \"including raising the deposit protection limit...\"\n- **Date Format:** Some translations use \"October 1st\" while others use \"October 1.\" Both are acceptable, but \"October 1\" is more formal and commonly used in official documents.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"Deposit Protection Scheme\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"Deposit Insurance Scheme\" for \"存款保障計劃.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and fluency by avoiding overly wordy or awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain a formal tone appropriate for legislative documents.\n- Use standard date formatting (\"October 1\") and currency notation (\"HK$800,000\").\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Legislative Council passed the Draft Deposit Insurance Scheme (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, implementing various measures to optimize the Deposit Insurance Scheme in two phases. The first phase of the optimization measures took effect on October 1, including raising the deposit insurance coverage per depositor per bank to HK$800,000.\n\n# August 1st\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 8月1日\". The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly as \"August 1st\" or \"August 1\". However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Use of the Hash Symbol (#):** The original includes a hash symbol before the date. While this is common in digital or social media contexts to denote a heading or tag, it is not typically used in formal English writing. However, if the context is informal or digital, retaining the hash symbol may be appropriate.\n2. **Date Format:** In English, \"August 1st\" is the correct ordinal form, while \"August 1\" is also acceptable, especially in more formal or written contexts where the ordinal is omitted. However, \"August 1st\" is more commonly used in headings or informal contexts.\n3. **Consistency:** All translations except the third one used \"August 1st,\" which is the most natural and commonly used form in English for such a heading.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would retain the hash symbol if it is stylistically appropriate and use \"August 1st\" for clarity and naturalness.\n\nThe original text announces the expansion of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism to cover online banking, counter transfers, and ATM transactions, including deposit machines. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, consistency, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Hong Kong Police Force, and the banking association (variously named as \"Banking Association,\" \"Hong Kong Association of Banks,\" or \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\").\n- The core message about the expansion of the alert mechanism is accurately conveyed in all translations.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"Suspicious Account Alert\" and \"ATM transactions.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in naming:** The banking association is referred to by different names across translations, which may confuse readers. The most accurate and commonly used term is \"Hong Kong Association of Banks.\"\n- **Tense and clarity issues:** Some translations use \"has announced\" or \"will be expanded,\" which may imply different timelines than the original. The original uses past tense for the announcement and past tense for the December expansion, suggesting both actions have already occurred.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat \"the scope of the alert mechanism\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n- **Clarity of \"counter transfers\":** The term \"counter transfers\" is less common in English financial contexts. \"In-person transfers\" or \"branch transfers\" might be more natural.\n- **Ambiguity in \"deposit machines\":** While \"deposit machines\" is understandable, \"cash deposit machines\" or \"deposit-taking ATMs\" is more precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a consistent name for the banking association: \"Hong Kong Association of Banks.\"\n- Use past tense consistently for both the announcement and the December expansion.\n- Simplify and streamline the sentence structure to avoid redundancy.\n- Use more natural financial terminology, such as \"in-person transfers\" instead of \"counter transfers.\"\n- Clarify \"deposit machines\" as \"cash deposit machines\" or \"deposit-taking ATMs.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, announced the expansion of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism to cover online banking and in-person transfers. The scope of the alert mechanism was further expanded in December to include transactions at automated teller machines (ATMs), including cash deposit machines.\n\nA series of measures to strengthen the fight against fraud have also been introduced, including a mechanism jointly established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the police, and the banking sector to provide the \"Anti-Scam Alert App\" with more timely and updated alerts regarding fake bank websites and suspicious phone calls.\n\n# August 2nd\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of an official statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and accuracy.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"Anti-Money Laundering Forum for the Financial Industry 2024\" as the event name. However, \"Forum\" may not be the most precise term for a \"研討會\" (seminar or workshop), which is more commonly translated as \"Seminar\" or \"Symposium.\"\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. The HKMA is the correct name of the institution. Additionally, \"Anti-Money Laundering in the Financial Industry Seminar 2024\" is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity.\n**Translation 3** correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Symposium\" for \"研討會,\" which is appropriate. However, the placement of the year \"2024\" at the end is less common in English event titles, where the year is typically placed at the beginning or immediately after the event name.\n**Translation 4** and **Translation 5** are nearly identical, both using \"Financial Sector\" instead of \"Financial Industry.\" While both terms are acceptable, \"Financial Industry\" is more commonly used in the context of regulatory and compliance events.\n**Translation 6** is very close to the best version, using \"Financial Industry\" and \"Seminar\" for \"研討會.\" However, it omits the possessive \"its\" before \"insights,\" which is slightly less precise than including it.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name of the institution: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"Seminar\" or \"Symposium\" for \"研討會,\" with \"Seminar\" being more common in this context.\n- Place the year \"2024\" immediately after the event name.\n- Include the possessive \"its\" for grammatical accuracy and clarity.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared its insights on measures to prevent and detect financial crimes at the \"2024 Financial Industry Anti-Money Laundering Seminar.\"\n\n# August 5th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 8月5日\". The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly as \"August 5th,\" which is the standard English format for dates. However, there are a few minor issues worth noting:\n1. **Use of the hashtag (#):** The original text includes a hashtag before the date. Only the first junior translator included the hashtag in their translation, while the others omitted it. Since the hashtag is part of the original formatting, it should be retained in the translation to maintain consistency.\n2. **Date format:** The date \"8月5日\" is written in the format \"month + day,\" which is common in Chinese. In English, the standard format is \"month + day + ordinal suffix\" (e.g., \"August 5th\"). All junior translators used this format correctly, with the exception of the fifth translator, who wrote \"August 5\" without the ordinal suffix. This is less precise and should be corrected to \"August 5th.\"\n3. **Fluency and cultural appropriateness:** The translations are all fluent and culturally appropriate. The use of \"August 5th\" is standard in English-speaking countries, and the hashtag is commonly used in digital contexts to denote a specific date or event.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the hashtag and use the correct date format with the ordinal suffix. Therefore, the improved translation is:\n# August 5th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) releasing a summary of public consultation on reviewing the three-tier banking system, with respondents broadly supporting the proposal to implement a new two-tier system. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator** uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is incorrect. The correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not the Financial Services and Markets Commission. This is a critical error in terminology.\n2. **Second junior translator** correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"published\" instead of \"has released,\" which is more natural in this context. However, \"reviewing\" is used as a gerund, which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"review\" as a noun.\n3. **Third junior translator** uses \"issued\" instead of \"published,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context. \"Widely\" is a slight variation of \"broadly,\" and both are correct, though \"broadly\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n4. **Fourth junior translator** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is ambiguous. Also, \"and\" is used instead of \"with,\" which slightly disrupts the flow and makes the sentence less formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator** is accurate and natural, using \"published\" and \"broadly,\" and correctly identifies the HKMA. The structure is clear and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator** uses \"public consultations\" (plural) instead of \"public consultation\" (singular), which is a minor but notable difference. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use \"published\" as the most natural verb in this context.\n- Use \"broadly\" to reflect the nuance of the original.\n- Maintain a formal yet fluent tone appropriate for official reports.\n- Avoid unnecessary variations in terminology or structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a summary of the public consultation on the review of the three-tier banking system, with respondents broadly supporting the proposal to implement a new two-tier banking system.\n\n# August 6\nThe original text is a simple date format, \"8月6日,\" which translates to \"August 6\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, including the use of \"6th\" and the inclusion of a \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in converting the month and day. However, there are some inconsistencies in formatting. The use of \"6th\" is not standard in English date formats, which typically use \"August 6\" without the ordinal suffix. Additionally, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and does not appear in standard English date formatting.\nThe best possible translation would be \"August 6,\" which is concise, clear, and follows standard English conventions for date formatting.\n\nThe original text is concise and formal, reflecting a policy-related announcement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, formality, and clarity that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the issuer of the report.\n- The term \"review report\" is consistently used, which is appropriate for this context.\n- The phrase \"three policy objectives\" is accurately translated, preserving the formal tone of the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the development of virtual banks has achieved the three policy objectives for introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\" The repetition of \"virtual banks\" is slightly redundant and could be streamlined.\n- The second translation uses \"introducing them in Hong Kong,\" which is grammatically correct but less precise than specifying \"virtual banks\" again, as it may cause ambiguity.\n- The third translation uses \"met the three policy objectives for introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\" While \"met\" is a valid synonym for \"achieved,\" it is slightly less formal and less commonly used in policy contexts.\n- The fourth translation uses \"introducing them to Hong Kong,\" which is slightly less natural than \"introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\"\n- The fifth and sixth translations are the most consistent and formal, using \"the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong,\" which is the most natural and precise phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the language should be formal, precise, and avoid redundancy. The phrase \"the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong\" is the most natural and grammatically sound, as it avoids repetition and maintains clarity. Using \"has achieved\" is more formal and commonly used in policy contexts than \"has met.\" Also, including the full name of the HKMA in parentheses on first mention is appropriate for clarity and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a review report on virtual banks. According to the findings of the review, the development of virtual banks has achieved the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) public consultation on renaming \"virtual banks\" to \"digital banks\" and the subsequent implementation of the new name and relaxed regulations. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, precision, and terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the authority involved.\n- The core message—public support for the renaming and the effective date—is accurately conveyed in all versions.\n- The use of \"respondents generally supported the proposal\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The first junior translator uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Fluency and Precision:** The phrase \"relaxation of requirements for their business and operations\" (first translator) is slightly awkward. \"Relaxed regulations regarding their business and operations\" (second and fifth translators) is more natural.\n- **Redundancy:** The third and sixth translators use \"their business and operations\" and \"their business operations,\" respectively. The latter is more concise and avoids redundancy.\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** The fourth and sixth translators use \"relaxed requirements for their operations\" and \"relaxation of regulations regarding their business operations,\" respectively. These are both clear but slightly less precise than \"relaxed regulations regarding their business and operations.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The correct name of the authority should be used consistently: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- The phrase \"relaxed regulations regarding their business and operations\" is the most natural and precise.\n- The phrase \"subsequently published a summary of public consultation on its proposal\" is more concise and accurate than \"subsequently published a summary of public consultation responses regarding the proposed renaming.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) subsequently published a summary of public consultation on its proposal to rename \"virtual banks\" to \"digital banks\" in October. Respondents generally supported the proposal. The new name and the relaxation of regulations regarding their business and operations took effect on October 25.\n\n# August 8\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company) has introduced new arrangements under its mortgage insurance scheme, considering on a case-by-case basis the approval of eligible homeowners to rent out their self-occupied properties.\n\n# August 9th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headlines or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor inconsistencies in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators used \"August 9th,\" which is grammatically correct in English and commonly used in formal and informal contexts. The second and fourth translators used \"August 9,\" which is also acceptable, though it omits the ordinal suffix \"th.\" The fifth translator used \"# August 9th,\" which includes an unnecessary hashtag, likely a formatting error or misunderstanding of the original text's purpose.\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and consistent with standard English date formatting. Since the original text is a simple date without additional context, the most appropriate translation is \"August 9th.\" This format is widely recognized and avoids any unnecessary symbols or formatting.\n\nThe original text is a straightforward news headline announcing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan). The goal is to convey the event clearly and professionally.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"has signed\" and includes the full name and acronym of the Indonesian authority. However, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is slightly redundant since \"HKMA\" is already the acronym for the full name.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"signed\" without the present perfect, which is acceptable in news headlines. The structure is clear and concise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate but omits the parenthetical \"(HKMA)\" after \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym. It also uses \"strengthen\" instead of \"enhance,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very similar to the second translation, with the same strengths. It uses \"enhance\" and \"signed\" without the present perfect, which is appropriate for a news headline.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes the full name and acronym of the Indonesian authority in parentheses. It uses \"enhance\" and \"signed\" without the present perfect, which is appropriate for a headline.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a critical error: it refers to \"the Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" This is a significant misrepresentation of the original text and should be corrected.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and professional, using appropriate terminology and structure for a news headline. It should include the full name and acronym of both organizations, use the correct verb tense, and avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan) to enhance the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\n\n# August 13th\n\nThe original text mentions the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (金管局), the Hong Kong Digital Harbour Management Limited (香港數碼港管理有限公司), and the Hong Kong Fintech Association (香港金融科技協會) as the co-organizers of the second FiNETech event. It also notes that over 300 professionals from the banking, securities, insurance, and technology sectors attended.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately translates the names of the organizations and the event. Uses \"co-hosted\" and includes \"to attend\" for completeness.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Digital Hub\" may not be the official English name of 香港數碼港管理有限公司. Also, \"FiNETech\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly hosted\" and correctly identifies the Hong Kong Fintech Association.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates 香港數碼港管理有限公司 as \"Science and Technology Parks Corporation (Science Park)\"—this is a different entity.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"FinTech\" with a hyphen.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Digital Harbour\" may not be the official English name. Also, \"organized\" is less precise than \"hosted\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Digital Hub\" and \"Fintech\" without a hyphen. Includes \"to attend\" for clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Digital Hub\" may not be the official name of the organization.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly hosted\" and correctly identifies the Hong Kong Fintech Association.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, incorrectly translates 香港數碼港管理有限公司 as \"Science and Technology Parks Corporation.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"FinTech\" with a hyphen.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Digital Harbour\" may not be the official name, and \"FinTech\" is less standard than \"Fintech\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The correct English name for 香港數碼港管理有限公司 is \"Hong Kong Digital Harbour Management Limited (Digital Harbour).\"\n- \"Fintech\" is the more commonly used term in the financial technology sector, without a hyphen.\n- \"Hosted\" is more appropriate than \"organized\" in the context of events.\n- Including \"to attend\" adds clarity to the sentence structure.\n- Consistency in capitalization of \"FiNETech\" is important for branding.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong Digital Harbour Management Limited (Digital Harbour), and the Hong Kong Fintech Association jointly hosted the second FiNETech, attracting over 300 professionals from the banking, securities, insurance, and technology sectors to attend.\n\nDuring the event period, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Digital Harbour announced the launch of a new generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) sandbox, aimed at promoting responsible innovation in the banking sector's development of GenAI. The list of the first batch of GenAI sandbox participants was announced in December, including 15 use cases from 10 banks and four technology partners.\n\n# August 15th\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement regarding measures to protect university students from fraud. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the police, the banking associations, and the target group (university students).\n- The use of terms like \"fraud,\" \"scams,\" and \"measures to protect\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear and follows a logical sequence.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The names of the associations vary across translations. For example, \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" \"Banking Association,\" \"Hong Kong Association of Banks,\" and \"Hong Kong China Banking Association\" are all used. The most accurate and commonly used term is \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\"\n- **Tense and Verb Agreement:** Some translations use the present perfect tense (\"has announced\"), which is less common in formal announcements unless the action has ongoing relevance. The simple past tense (\"announced\") is more standard in such contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Clarity:** The phrase \"China-funded Banks Association\" and \"Association of Banks with Mainland China Origin\" are awkward and less commonly used. The term \"Hong Kong China Banking Association\" is more standard and widely recognized.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"prevent them from becoming victims of fraud\" versus \"protect university students from becoming victims of scams.\" The latter is more concise and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the most standard and widely recognized names for the associations.\n- Use the simple past tense for the verb \"announced\" to align with formal announcements.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, avoiding redundancy and awkward constructions.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the police, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, and the Hong Kong China Banking Association, announced a series of measures to protect university students from becoming victims of scams.\n\n# August 18\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Maldives Monetary Authority to strengthen the exchange of regulatory information and cooperation.\n\n# August 19\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing guidelines to banks regarding the use of Generative AI (GenAI) to protect consumers, as well as encouraging banks to explore AI for enhanced consumer protection. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology, style, and formality that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the core message: the HKMA issuing guidelines and encouraging AI exploration for consumer protection.\n- The use of \"Generative AI\" or \"GenAI\" is consistent with the original, and \"artificial intelligence\" is appropriately used.\n- The structure of the sentences is clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and fifth translations use \"The Monetary Authority\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA,\" which may be less precise and potentially ambiguous.\n- The fourth translation uses \"The Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is not the correct name for the entity in question.\n- Some translations use \"safeguard\" while others use \"protect\" or \"enhance,\" which are all acceptable but may vary in tone and formality.\n- The use of \"guiding principles\" in the fourth translation is slightly different from \"a set of principles\" used in others, though still accurate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Consistency in the name of the authority: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or its acronym \"HKMA\" should be used throughout.\n- Use of \"safeguard\" may be more formal and appropriate in a regulatory context.\n- The phrase \"actively explore the use of artificial intelligence\" is clear, but \"leverage artificial intelligence\" (as in the fourth translation) is slightly more concise and modern-sounding.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to banks, providing a set of principles for the application of Generative AI to safeguard consumers. The HKMA also encourages banks to actively explore leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance consumer protection.\n\n# August 23rd\n\nThe original text discusses the establishment of a joint task force by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Banking Association to support SMEs at both the case and industry levels. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, but the use of \"jointly established a joint\" is redundant. The term \"special task force\" is appropriate, but \"at both the case and industry levels\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate, with \"dedicated SME Financing Task Force\" being a good choice. However, \"from both individual case and industry perspectives\" is slightly wordy and less natural than \"at both the case and industry levels.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate, but \"from both individual case and industry levels\" is awkward and should be revised for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"set up\" instead of \"established,\" which is slightly more colloquial but still acceptable. The phrase \"at both the case and industry levels\" is natural and clear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The use of \"Monetary Authority\" without \"Hong Kong\" is incorrect, as the full name is necessary for clarity. Also, \"case-level and industry-level perspectives\" is unnecessarily wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a significant error. The rest of the translation is otherwise accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full and correct name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, avoid redundancy, and use natural phrasing. \"Set up\" is slightly more colloquial than \"established,\" but both are acceptable. The phrase \"at both the case and industry levels\" is the most natural and concise way to express the dual focus of the task force.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association have jointly set up a special task force on SME financing to further advance support for SMEs at both the case and industry levels.\n\n# September 9th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the correct date, but there are minor differences in formatting that could affect consistency and clarity.\nThe first, second, sixth, and fifth translators all used \"September 9th,\" which is a standard and natural way to express the date in English. The third and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the text is part of a list or heading with numbered entries. However, the original Chinese text does not include a \"#\" symbol, so adding it may be unnecessary unless context dictates otherwise. The fourth translator used \"September 9,\" omitting the \"th\" suffix, which is less common in formal or written English, though it is acceptable in informal contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"September 9th,\" as it is the most standard and natural form in English without unnecessary symbols or omissions.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) announcement regarding the benefits of AI in monitoring suspicious activities and the measures taken to support banks in adopting AI, including a forum with a local tech hub in November.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"co-hosting a forum.\" However, \"issued a notice to share\" is slightly less natural than \"issued a notice sharing.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Cyberport\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is a factual error. Also, \"the authorities\" is incorrect; it should be \"the authority.\" The phrase \"support and accelerate banks' adoption of AI\" is good.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Correctly uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"co-hosting a forum.\" The structure is clear and accurate. However, \"application of AI by banks\" is slightly less natural than \"adoption of AI by banks.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Cyberport\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is a factual error. \"Co-organizing\" is slightly less common than \"co-hosting.\" \"Share relevant experience\" should be \"share relevant experiences\" to match the plural \"experiences\" in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Digital Harbour\" correctly. \"Hosting a forum\" is slightly less precise than \"co-hosting.\" The phrase \"application of artificial intelligence by banks\" is slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Cyberport\" instead of \"Digital Harbour,\" which is a factual error. \"Banking sector's adoption of AI\" is a good phrasing. \"Co-organizing\" is slightly less common than \"co-hosting.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name: \"Digital Harbour\" (not \"Cyberport\").\n- Use \"co-hosting\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Use \"experiences\" (plural) to match the original.\n- Use \"adoption\" rather than \"application\" for better alignment with the context of AI in banking.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally and is grammatically correct.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice sharing the advantages of artificial intelligence in monitoring suspicious activities, as well as the measures taken by the authority to support and accelerate the adoption of AI by banks, including co-hosting a forum with Digital Harbour in November to share relevant experiences.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe original text discusses the joint issuance of a consultation summary document by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) regarding the optimization of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reporting regime, with the proposed measures taking effect on September 29, 2025.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and SFC, uses \"over-the-counter derivatives reporting regime,\" and the date format is appropriate. However, it lacks the full name of the HKMA in parentheses, which is common in formal documents.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"enhancements\" instead of \"optimization,\" which is a slight variation in terminology but still appropriate. The use of \"over-the-counter (OTC)\" is good for clarity. However, it omits the full name of the HKMA.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation contains a critical error: it refers to the \"Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO)\" instead of the \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\" This is a significant mistake, as the SFO is a legal statute, not the regulatory body involved. The date format is also less standard (29 September 2025).\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and well-written. It includes the full name of the HKMA in parentheses, uses \"over-the-counter (OTC)\" for clarity, and the date format is standard. It is a strong translation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate but again refers to the \"Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO)\" instead of the \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\" It also uses \"reporting system\" instead of \"reporting regime,\" which is a minor but noticeable difference in terminology. The date format is less standard.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"enhancing\" instead of \"optimizing,\" which is a stylistic choice but still appropriate. It includes the full name of the HKMA in parentheses and uses the standard date format. It is a strong translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include the full name of the HKMA in parentheses, use the correct name of the regulatory body (SFC, not SFO), and use standard date formatting (September 29, 2025). It should also use precise terminology such as \"reporting regime\" and \"optimization measures.\" The fourth and sixth translations are both strong, but the fourth is slightly more precise in its terminology and structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) jointly issued a consultation summary document on optimizing Hong Kong's over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reporting regime. The proposed optimization measures will take effect on September 29, 2025.\n\n# September 27\nThe original text is simply a date marked with a hashtag (#). The junior translators have all captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting. The first, second, third, fifth, and sixth translators used \"September 27,\" which is standard in English for formal or written contexts. The fourth translator used \"September 27th,\" which is more informal and commonly used in spoken English or in contexts where the ordinal suffix is emphasized.\nHowever, in formal or neutral contexts, the ordinal suffix (\"th\") is often omitted unless it is necessary for clarity or emphasis. Since the original text only includes the date without any additional context, the most neutral and standard form would be \"September 27.\" The use of the hashtag (#) is consistent across all translations, which is appropriate as it mirrors the original formatting.\nThe best possible translation would be to retain the hashtag and use the standard date format without the ordinal suffix, as it is the most natural and widely accepted form in English.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's publication of a report on generative AI (GenAI) in the financial services sector, emphasizing its transformative potential and impact on operational efficiency, risk management, and customer engagement.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Study Report\" and \"thoroughly exploring,\" which are appropriate. However, it omits the acronym \"HKMA\" and does not specify the full name of the authority, which may be important for clarity.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version includes the full name and acronym (HKMA), which is a strength. It uses \"delving into\" instead of \"thoroughly exploring,\" which is slightly more formal and appropriate for a report. However, \"the industry\" is vague and could be more specific as \"the financial industry.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is not the correct name of the organization in question.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"Research Report\" instead of \"Study Report,\" which is a minor variation. It is otherwise similar to the first translation and omits the acronym \"HKMA.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is very similar to the fourth, with the same minor variation in the title of the report. It uses \"delving into\" instead of \"thoroughly exploring,\" which is a slight improvement in tone.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is the most refined. It includes the full name and acronym (HKMA), uses \"delving deeply into\" for a more formal tone, and specifies \"in terms of\" for clarity. However, \"Research Report\" may not be the exact title used in the original.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should include the full name and acronym of the authority (HKMA), use the exact title of the report as provided in the original, and maintain a formal yet clear tone. The phrase \"delving deeply into\" is more appropriate for a formal report than \"thoroughly exploring.\" Additionally, specifying \"the financial industry\" rather than \"the industry\" adds clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the \"Research Report on Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Services Sector,\" delving deeply into the transformative potential of GenAI and its impact on the financial industry, particularly in terms of operational efficiency, risk management, and customer engagement.\n\n# September 30\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a summary of public consultation on information exchange by authorized institutions to assist in crime prevention and detection, with respondents generally supporting the proposal.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"authorized institutions\" appropriately. However, \"published\" is in the past tense, which is slightly inconsistent with the original text's neutral tone.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. The term \"regarding\" is slightly more formal than necessary, and \"crime\" is singular, which may not match the original's plural \"罪案.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"relevant institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which may not be as precise. Also, \"proposals\" is plural, while the original uses \"建議\" (singular), which may be a minor inconsistency.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"publishes\" in the present tense, which may not align with the original's past tense. \"Support the recommendations\" is slightly different from \"support the proposal,\" which may not be a major issue but is worth noting.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in context. The phrase \"proposed measures\" is slightly more formal than \"proposal,\" but it is still accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"public consultations\" (plural) instead of \"public consultation\" (singular), which may not be accurate. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct full name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"), maintain the past tense to match the original, use \"authorized institutions\" for accuracy, and use \"proposal\" in singular to match the original. It should also be concise and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a summary of public consultation on the exchange of information by authorized institutions to assist in preventing or detecting crimes. Respondents generally supported the proposal.\n\n# October 9th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in headlines or titles. All translations provided by the junior translators are essentially correct in terms of content, as they all accurately represent the date \"10月9日\" as \"October 9th.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting that could be considered for improvement.\nThe first, second, third, fifth translators have used \"October 9th\" without any additional formatting, which is appropriate for most contexts. The fourth and sixth translators included a \"#\" symbol before the date, which may be intended to mimic the original format used in the Chinese text. However, in English, the use of a \"#\" symbol before a date is not standard unless it is part of a specific heading or labeling system.\nConsidering the context, if the original Chinese text was used as a heading or title, it might be appropriate to maintain the \"#\" symbol in the English translation to preserve the visual structure. However, in most standard English writing, the \"#\" symbol is not used before dates unless it is part of a specific format or platform requirement (e.g., social media posts, hashtags).\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be to retain the date as \"October 9th\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and standard format in English. If the \"#\" symbol is necessary for formatting purposes, it could be included, but it should be noted that it is not standard in formal English writing.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"Integrity Pledge for the Banking Sector\" and \"launch ceremony\" appropriately. However, it uses \"co-organizing\" which is slightly less formal than \"co-hosted\" or \"co-organized.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and clear, but it uses \"Banking Integrity Charter\" instead of \"Pledge,\" which may not be the exact term used by the ICAC. Also, \"jointly hosted\" is more natural than \"jointly hosted.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is well-structured and accurate, using \"Hong Kong Bankers Association\" and \"co-hosted\" correctly. It also includes the full names and acronyms for ICAC and HKMA, which is good for clarity.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Code of Integrity for the Banking Industry,\" which may not be the exact term used in the original. It also uses \"co-organized,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"co-hosted.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is concise and accurate, using \"Banking Sector Integrity Pledge\" and \"jointly hosted.\" It also uses \"management representatives\" which is slightly more formal than \"senior management.\"\n6. **Translation 6** has a minor issue with \"jointly organize the launching ceremony\" – \"launching\" is not the standard term; \"launch\" is more appropriate. Also, \"Code of Integrity\" may not be the exact term used in the original.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The term \"Integrity Pledge\" is more likely to be the official term used by the ICAC, as opposed to \"Charter\" or \"Code.\"\n- \"Co-hosted\" is more natural and commonly used in formal contexts than \"co-organized.\"\n- \"Senior management\" is more precise than \"management representatives\" or \"management.\"\n- Including the full name and acronym for ICAC and HKMA adds clarity and professionalism.\n- \"Covering\" is more natural than \"encompassing\" or \"including\" in this context.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use the most accurate terminology, maintain a formal and professional tone, and ensure clarity and fluency in English.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers Association support the \"Banking Sector Integrity Pledge\" launched by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), and co-hosted the launch ceremony with the ICAC. Senior management from 30 banks attended the ceremony, covering Hong Kong's major retail banks and private wealth management banks.\n\n# October 10th\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 10月10日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, with the most common being \"October 10th\" and \"October 10.\" \nThe translations that use \"October 10th\" are more accurate in terms of English date formatting, as the ordinal suffix \"-th\" is typically used in English when writing out dates in full. \"October 10\" is also grammatically correct but lacks the ordinal suffix, which may be less formal or less commonly used in written English for dates.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is worth noting. In English, the \"#\" symbol is often used to denote a heading or a section title, so retaining it in the translation is appropriate. However, in some contexts, it may be omitted if the format is being adapted for a different style or platform.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use the full date format with the ordinal suffix, resulting in \"# October 10th.\" This preserves the original structure and adheres to standard English date conventions.\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of a regulation and specifying the effective date of Basel III reforms in Hong Kong. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to formal legal English conventions.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but the title is slightly awkward: \"Announcement on the Effective Date of the 2023 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules (2024)\" is not the most natural phrasing for a legal gazette notice. The use of \"published in the Gazette\" is also slightly off; the correct term is \"gazetted.\"\n**Translation 2** is more natural and uses \"gazetted\" correctly. The phrase \"will take effect\" is appropriate for a future date. However, the title is still slightly awkward, and the use of \"Notice on the Effective Date\" may not be the most precise term for a legal gazette notice.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"year 2024\" instead of \"2024,\" which is less formal. The phrase \"final reforms of 'Basel III'\" is slightly less precise than \"final reform package of Basel III.\"\n**Translation 4** is confusing due to the structure of the title: \"Notice of the Gazette on the commencement date of the 2024 (Amendment) Rules (Capital) for the Banking Sector (2023)\" is not clear and may mislead readers about the relationship between the year and the rules.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Notice of Publication of the Banking (Capital) (Revised) Rules 2024,\" which is not the standard title for a gazette notice. The term \"revised\" is not the best fit for \"修訂\" in this context, which is more accurately translated as \"amendment.\"\n**Translation 6** is the most concise but lacks the formal tone expected in legal notices. It also omits the verb \"was\" after \"published,\" which makes the sentence grammatically incomplete.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the standard legal terminology, such as \"gazetted\" instead of \"published,\" and should accurately reflect the title of the notice. The phrase \"final reform package of Basel III\" is more precise than \"final reforms of Basel III.\" The title should be structured to clearly indicate that the notice is about the effective date of the 2023 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules (2024).\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"Notice on the Effective Date of the 2023 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules (2024)\" has been gazetted, designating January 1, 2025, as the effective date for the final reform package of Basel III in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 10th\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 10月10日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, with the most common being \"October 10th\" and \"October 10.\" \nThe translations that use \"October 10th\" are more accurate in terms of English date formatting, as the ordinal suffix \"-th\" is typically used in English when writing out dates in full. \"October 10\" is also grammatically correct but lacks the ordinal suffix, which may be less formal or less commonly used in written English for dates.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is worth noting. In English, the \"#\" symbol is often used to denote a heading or a section title, so retaining it in the translation is appropriate. However, in some contexts, it may be omitted if the format is being adapted for a different style or platform.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use the full date format with the ordinal suffix, resulting in \"# October 10th.\" This preserves the original structure and adheres to standard English date conventions.\n\nTo prevent malicious software fraud in payment card transactions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has provided guidance to banks to further enhance the security of online payment card transactions. Starting from the end of 2024, bank customers will be able to authenticate online payment card transactions through mobile banking applications instead of one-time SMS verification.\n\n# October 16th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing guidelines to banks to adjust countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The key points are the uniform setting of the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio caps for both residential and non-residential properties.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"countercyclical macroprudential measures\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" and \"debt-to-income ratio.\" However, it uses \"has issued\" which is slightly less direct than \"issued\" in the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"issued guidelines to banks, adjusting...\" which is slightly more concise. The use of \"loan-to-value ratio cap\" and \"debt-service ratio cap\" is appropriate. However, \"debt-service ratio\" is slightly less common than \"debt-to-income ratio\" in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation misidentifies the HKMA as the \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"standardized\" instead of \"set\" or \"uniformly set,\" which is slightly less precise. The term \"debt-to-income ratio\" is correct, but the overall phrasing is less direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"mortgage-to-value ratio\" instead of \"loan-to-value ratio,\" which is a minor but notable inaccuracy. It also uses \"debt service-to-income ratio\" with a hyphen, which is inconsistent with the more standard \"debt-to-income ratio.\" The use of \"are uniformly set\" is slightly less direct than \"is uniformly set.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"debt service-to-income ratio\" with a hyphen, which is slightly less standard than \"debt-to-income ratio.\" However, the overall structure is clear and precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"70 percent\" and \"50 percent\" with the word \"percent\" instead of the symbol, which is more formal and appropriate in official contexts. It also uses quotation marks around \"debt-to-income ratio,\" which is unnecessary but not incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use standard financial terminology. It should also reflect the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above review, the sixth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, with only minor adjustments needed for consistency in terminology and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures applicable to property mortgage loans. After the revision, the loan-to-value ratio cap for all residential and non-residential property mortgages is uniformly set at 70 percent, and the debt-to-income ratio cap is uniformly set at 50 percent.\n\n# October 16th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and grammatical consistency that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the government's announcement, the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, the \"interest-only\" repayment option, the extension of guarantee periods, and the introduction of \"partial principal repayment.\"\n- The use of terms like \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" is consistent across most translations, with only minor variations in the full name (e.g., \"Small and Medium Enterprise\" vs. \"Small and Medium Enterprises\").\n- The dates and numerical data (12 months, 10 years, 8 years) are accurately translated in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financing Guarantee Program\" while others use \"Financing Guarantee Scheme.\" The original uses “計劃” (plan\/scheme), so \"Scheme\" is more appropriate.\n- **Verb Tense and Temporality:** Some translations use \"took effect\" while others use \"will take effect\" or \"take effect.\" The original text uses “生效” (take effect), which is a future action, so \"will take effect\" is more accurate.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Phrases like \"interest-only payments without repaying the principal\" are unnecessarily wordy. \"Interest-only repayment\" is more concise and natural.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"borrowing enterprises\" is slightly formal and less commonly used in English policy documents. \"Borrowing companies\" or \"borrowing businesses\" may be more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.\"\n- Use the future tense (\"will take effect\") to reflect the timing of the policy change.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, such as \"interest-only repayment\" instead of \"interest-only payments without repaying the principal.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency by avoiding overly formal or awkward phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe government announced enhancements to the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" allowing borrowing companies to apply for up to 12 months of \"interest-only repayment\" on existing and new loans. Additionally, the maximum loan guarantee periods for 80% and 90% credit guarantee products have been extended to 10 years and 8 years, respectively, and a \"partial principal repayment\" option will be offered for new loans under both guarantee products. These measures will take effect on November 18.\n\n# October 18th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"# 10月18日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first and fifth translations use \"October 18th,\" which is grammatically correct and commonly used in English for dates. The second and fourth translations use \"# October 18\" and \"# October 18th,\" respectively, which include a hashtag symbol. The third translation is \"October 18,\" which omits the \"th\" suffix.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in the second and fourth translations may be appropriate if the original text is part of a social media post or a heading in a digital format. However, the original text does not provide context that suggests the use of a hashtag. Therefore, including it may be unnecessary or stylistically inconsistent with the original.\nThe third translation, \"October 18,\" is grammatically correct but omits the ordinal suffix \"th,\" which is typically used in English for dates. While it is acceptable in some contexts, such as in formal writing or when the date is used in a list, the use of \"October 18th\" is more standard and natural in most English-speaking contexts.\nThe first, fifth, and sixth translations all use \"October 18th,\" which is the most accurate and natural translation of the original date. It correctly includes the ordinal suffix and does not add any unnecessary symbols.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"October 18th,\" as it accurately reflects the original date without adding or omitting any unnecessary elements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the main actor and mention the collaboration with the banking sector.\n- The key measures—releasing bank capital, setting aside funds, and introducing credit products—are consistently mentioned across translations.\n- The goal of supporting SMEs in their development and expansion is well captured in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" (Translation 6), which is not the official name of the HKMA. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Translation 1 uses \"from the aspects of funding and banking products and services,\" which is awkward. Translation 3 repeats this phrase, making it less fluent. Translation 4 uses \"enhancing banking products and services,\" which is slightly more natural but still not as precise as \"banking products and services.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"banking industry\" (Translation 5) is less precise than \"banking sector,\" which is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Nuance:** Translation 6 uses \"easing banking capital requirements\" instead of \"releasing bank capital,\" which slightly changes the meaning. It also uses \"transform and adapt,\" which is more general than the original's \"轉型\" (transformation).\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the official name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"banking sector\" for consistency and accuracy.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"from the aspects of funding and banking products and services\" is rephrased for fluency.\n- Maintain the precise meaning of \"release bank capital\" and \"set aside dedicated funds.\"\n- Use \"transformation\" rather than \"transform and adapt\" to match the original nuance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the banking sector, has introduced five new measures to further support the sustained development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through funding and banking products and services, and to assist them in exploring new business opportunities and markets. These measures include releasing bank capital to meet SME financing needs, setting aside dedicated funds to support SMEs, and introducing more credit products and services to assist SMEs in their transformation.\n\n# October 28\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol preceding the date. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"October 28th,\" which is grammatically correct in English but slightly more formal and less commonly used in modern contexts, especially in titles or headings. The second and third translations use \"October 28\" and include the \"#\" symbol, which is closer to the original format. However, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in English date formats, so its inclusion may be unnecessary or confusing.\nThe best approach is to retain the date format that is most natural in English while preserving the structure of the original text as closely as possible. Using \"October 28\" without the \"#\" symbol is the most natural and widely accepted format in English. However, if the \"#\" symbol is intended to denote a heading or section title, it could be retained, but it is not standard in English date formatting. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is simply \"October 28.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the entity launching the platform.\n- The name of the platform, \"Fintech Connect,\" is consistently translated.\n- The purpose of the platform—to connect financial institutions with fintech service providers—is accurately conveyed.\n- The mention of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone and the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is present in all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"one-stop assistance,\" \"fostering collaboration,\" and \"promoting the growth of the fintech ecosystem\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations refer to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use phrases like \"one-stop assistance\" or \"one-stop service,\" which are acceptable but could be more natural. \"One-stop solution\" is more commonly used in business contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are slightly wordy, such as \"further strengthening the platform, enhancing collaboration in the GBA,\" which could be more concise.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Greater Bay Area\" is correctly used, but it is often abbreviated as \"GBA\" in English texts, which should be introduced with the full name first.\n- **Grammar and Syntax:** Minor grammatical issues, such as the use of \"the platform has incorporated\" instead of \"the HKMA has incorporated,\" can affect clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the correct official name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use \"one-stop solution\" instead of \"one-stop assistance\" or \"one-stop service\" for a more natural business tone.\n- Ensure clarity by specifying that the HKMA is the one incorporating fintech service providers from Qianhai.\n- Introduce \"Greater Bay Area (GBA)\" with the full name first, then use the abbreviation.\n- Use more concise and fluent phrasing to avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a cross-industry fintech matching platform called \"Fintech Connect,\" designed to connect financial institutions with fintech service providers. The platform offers a one-stop solution to accurately match the supply and demand of fintech services, promoting collaboration and innovation. In cooperation with the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone Administration, the HKMA has incorporated fintech service providers from Qianhai, further enhancing the platform and strengthening cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), thereby promoting the common growth of the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# November 5th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"# 11月5日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first, third, sixth, and fifth translators have all used \"November 5th\", which is the most accurate and natural way to express the date in English. The second and fifth translators included a \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original text but may not be necessary in the English translation unless it serves a specific formatting purpose. The fourth translator used \"November 5\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less formal and less commonly used in modern English for dates.\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English. Since the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in English date formats, it is best to omit it unless it is part of a specific heading or formatting requirement. The use of \"November 5th\" is the most appropriate and natural translation of the date.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing guidelines to banks involved in payment card issuance and acquiring businesses, with the aim of enhancing consumer protection when merchants suspend operations or close down. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses appropriate terminology such as \"payment card issuance and acquiring businesses.\" The phrase \"aiming to enhance consumer protection\" is natural and conveys the intended purpose clearly.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"cease business\" instead of \"close down,\" which is a slightly more formal expression. However, \"operating payment card issuance and acquiring businesses\" is slightly awkward compared to \"engaged in\" or \"operating in.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and natural. The use of \"has issued\" is slightly more formal than \"issued,\" but it is still acceptable. The phrase \"temporarily suspend operations or close down\" is clear and precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"direct debit authorisations\" instead of \"direct payment authorizations,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original term. \"Direct debit\" refers to a different financial mechanism than \"direct payment authorization.\" Additionally, \"issuing and acquiring payment card businesses\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct regulatory body in this context. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"direct payment authorizations on payment cards,\" which is slightly more precise than \"regarding direct payment authorizations.\" The phrase \"temporarily suspend operations or cease business\" is also natural and appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, use natural and fluent English, and maintain the correct terminology. The first, third, and sixth translations are the most accurate and natural. However, the first translation is slightly more concise and uses \"engaged in\" which is a more standard phrasing in regulatory contexts. The sixth translation is also strong, but the use of \"on payment cards\" may be slightly more specific than necessary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to banks engaged in payment card issuance and acquiring businesses regarding direct payment authorizations, aiming to enhance consumer protection when merchants temporarily suspend operations or close down.\n\n# November 8th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying the action taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to introduce a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products with the aim of promoting responsible lending and reducing the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing.\n**Review of the Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is the correct official name. The verb tense \"is introducing\" is appropriate for a policy that is being implemented. The phrasing \"to promote responsible lending and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing\" is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation uses \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is incorrect. The correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the first one, but it uses \"responsible borrowing\" instead of \"responsible lending.\" While both are acceptable, \"responsible lending\" is more commonly used in financial regulatory contexts to refer to the practices of lenders.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in formal contexts. However, the verb tense \"has introduced\" implies the action is completed, whereas the original text may be referring to a policy that is being introduced, not necessarily already implemented.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses the correct name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the past tense \"introduced,\" which may be appropriate if the policy has already been implemented.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is identical to the fifth and is also accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the full official name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality. It should use the present continuous tense \"is introducing\" to reflect an ongoing or recent policy implementation. It should use \"responsible lending\" to align with standard financial terminology. The phrase \"to promote responsible lending and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing\" is accurate and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is introducing a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to promote responsible lending and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing.\n\n# November 11th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and cultural context. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"SMEs\" and \"digital transformation.\" However, it uses \"Digital Harbour\" instead of the more commonly used \"Cyberport\" in official contexts.\n**Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"Cyberport\" correctly and \"Bankers' Association\" instead of \"Bankers Association.\" It also uses \"support the digital transformation of SMEs through big data and technology,\" which is slightly more natural than the first version.\n**Translation 3** uses \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" and \"Hong Kong China Enterprises Banking Association,\" which are not standard names for these organizations. It also uses \"hosted\" instead of \"organized,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Digital Harbour\" again and \"food and retail sectors\" instead of \"catering and retail sectors,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"exchanged opinions\" instead of \"exchanged views,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation\" instead of \"Cyberport,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"SMEs\" consistently and \"hosted\" instead of \"organized,\" which is acceptable.\n**Translation 6** is very close to Translation 1 but uses \"Digital Harbour\" and \"on-site\" instead of \"at the event.\" It is slightly less natural in phrasing.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct official names for organizations, such as \"Cyberport\" and \"Hong Kong Bankers Association.\" It should also use standard terminology like \"SMEs\" and \"digital transformation.\" The phrasing should be natural and fluent, avoiding overly formal or informal expressions. The verb \"organized\" is more appropriate than \"hosted\" in this context. Additionally, \"catering and retail sectors\" is more precise than \"food and retail sectors.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent versions, using the correct names, standard terminology, and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Cyberport, the Hong Kong Bankers Association, and the Association of Chinese Banks in Hong Kong jointly organized the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Digital Technology Solutions Showcase Day.\" Over 100 participants, including SMEs from the catering and retail sectors, bank representatives, and technology solution providers, exchanged views on how the banking industry can support SMEs' digital transformation through big data and technology. Technology service companies also showcased various digital technology solutions designed specifically for SMEs at the event.\n\n# November 13th\n\nThe original text discusses a collaborative workshop organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) with several other entities to combat online fraud, specifically deepfake technology scams. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities involved: the HKMA, police, a digital policy office, and a banking association.\n- The core message of the workshop—raising awareness of deepfake fraud and sharing best practices—is consistently conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"deepfake technology scams\" and \"best practices.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Office for Financial Technology\" or \"Office of the Digital Policy,\" while others use \"Office for Digital Policy.\" The correct term is \"Office for Digital Policy\" as per official HKMA references.\n- **Entity Names:** The \"Banking Association\" is more commonly referred to as the \"Hong Kong Banking Association\" or \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" in official contexts. \"Bankers' Association\" is less precise.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"jointly held\" or \"jointly hosted,\" which are acceptable, but \"jointly organized\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Phrases like \"enhance the industry’s understanding\" and \"raise industry awareness\" are both correct, but \"raise awareness\" is more natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the official name \"Office for Digital Policy\" to ensure consistency with HKMA terminology.\n- Use \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" for clarity and accuracy.\n- Use \"jointly organized\" as it is more formal and commonly used in such contexts.\n- Use \"raise awareness\" instead of \"enhance understanding\" for a more natural and commonly used expression in this context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the police, the Office for Digital Policy, and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, jointly organized an anti-online fraud workshop to raise industry awareness of fraud methods involving deepfake technology and to share best practices for managing related risks.\n"}

However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the English translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the main points: the uncertain global economic outlook, U.S. policy uncertainties, inflation risks, improved market sentiment in China and Hong Kong due to stimulus measures, and the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system.\n- The use of terms like \"economic stimulus measures,\" \"market sentiment,\" \"policy interest rates,\" and \"financial system resilience\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"U.S.\" while others use \"United States,\" and \"Mainland China\" vs. \"mainland China.\" While not incorrect, consistency in terminology is preferable for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations use phrases like \"long-established resilience\" or \"built up over the years,\" which are slightly redundant or less idiomatic than alternatives like \"well-established resilience\" or \"developed over the years.\"\n- **Minor grammatical or stylistic issues:** For example, \"coupled with inflation facing upward risks\" is slightly awkward compared to \"coupled with upward risks to inflation.\"\n- **Nuance in tone:** Some translations use \"enhance the tourism industry\" while others use \"enhance the recovery of the tourism sector.\" The latter is more precise in reflecting the context of post-stimulus recovery.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain the original meaning while ensuring clarity, fluency, and natural English expression. This involves:\n- Ensuring consistent terminology (e.g., \"U.S.\" or \"United States,\" \"Mainland China\").\n- Using concise and idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"well-established resilience\" instead of \"long-established resilience\").\n- Ensuring that the sentence structure flows naturally in English, avoiding overly literal translations.\n- Maintaining a professional and neutral tone appropriate for economic analysis.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would integrate the best elements of the junior translations while refining the language for clarity and fluency.\nThe global economic outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, with significant uncertainty surrounding U.S. economic and trade policies, compounded by upward risks to inflation, leading to market concerns about the future direction of U.S. policy interest rates. At the same time, following the announcement and gradual implementation of economic stimulus measures by Mainland China, market sentiment in both Mainland China and Hong Kong has improved. The various supportive measures introduced by the government should further enhance the recovery of Hong Kong's tourism sector. Hong Kong's financial system, with its well-established resilience and ample buffers developed over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) commitment to maintaining financial stability, managing risks, and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of key terms such as \"stability and soundness,\" \"macroeconomic environment,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"monetary and financial stability.\"\n- Consistent use of formal and professional tone, appropriate for a government or regulatory body.\n- Proper structure and flow of the sentences, maintaining the logical progression of the original text.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive phrasing, such as \"strive to\" or \"striving to,\" which can be simplified or varied for better readability.\n- The phrase \"create policy space\" is used in all translations, but it is a direct translation of the Chinese term and may not be the most idiomatic in English.\n- The use of \"defensive arrangements\" or \"defensive preparations\" is slightly less common than \"defensive measures\" or \"defensive positioning\" in financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"financial center\" while others use \"financial centre,\" which is a British English variant. For consistency with American English, \"financial center\" is preferable unless the target audience is primarily British.\nImprovements could include:\n- Using more varied verbs such as \"monitor,\" \"assess,\" or \"address\" instead of repeating \"strive to.\"\n- Ensuring consistency in terminology, such as using \"financial center\" throughout.\n- Using more idiomatic expressions, such as \"capitalize on opportunities\" instead of \"seize opportunities.\"\n- Ensuring that the phrase \"create policy space\" is either retained with a brief explanation or replaced with a more natural equivalent, such as \"create room for policy maneuverability.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use consistent terminology, and incorporate more natural phrasing where appropriate.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to promote the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and infrastructure. In the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, striving to promptly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, we will actively capitalize on opportunities and create room for policy maneuverability to further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund prudently and flexibly, implementing appropriate defensive measures, maintaining high liquidity, and continuously diversifying our investments. Our goal is to improve the long-term investment returns of the Exchange Fund and ensure that it can continue to effectively maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# A Stable and Sound Financial System\n\nUnder the new U.S. administration, policy directions are difficult to predict, leading to geopolitical and economic fragmentation. As a result, global economic uncertainty is expected to persist into 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bears the important responsibility of promoting the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system. It will continue to remain vigilant, guard against various potential risks, stay abreast of the latest developments, and be prepared to provide support to Hong Kong's economy at any time.\n\n# Stay vigilant against potential risks.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with its established resilience and buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in vocabulary, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA\") and accurately translate the main actions: monitoring risks, taking measures, and assessing potential risks.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the message.\n- The use of terms like \"monetary and financial systems\" is consistent across most translations, which is appropriate for the formal tone of the text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"instabilities\" or \"uncertainties\" instead of \"unstable factors\" or \"destabilizing factors.\" While these are not incorrect, \"risks and instabilities\" may be less precise than \"risks and unstable factors\" in the context of economic and financial monitoring.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The use of \"as needed\" versus \"as necessary\" is a minor stylistic difference, but \"as needed\" is more commonly used in formal policy statements.\n- **Consistency in Abbreviations:** The use of \"HKMA\" versus \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is inconsistent across translations. For a formal document, it is better to use the full name first and then the abbreviation in parentheses, if needed.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"the Hong Kong economy\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the full name \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) for clarity and formality, especially in the first mention.\n- Choose precise and commonly used terms such as \"risks and unstable factors\" to reflect the original intent accurately.\n- Maintain a consistent and formal tone, avoiding redundancy and ensuring that the translation reads smoothly in English.\n- Ensure that the translation reflects the official and policy-oriented nature of the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor risks and unstable factors in both the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems. We will also study matters that may affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with them.\n\n# Maintaining the Stability of the Banking System\nThe original Chinese text is a concise title: # 保持銀行體系穩定. The junior translators have produced several variations, most of which are accurate but differ in punctuation and capitalization.\nThe first and fifth translations both use the hashtag and capitalize \"Maintaining the Stability of the Banking System,\" which is appropriate for a title. However, the use of a hashtag (#) may not be necessary unless the context specifically requires it (e.g., for social media or a specific formatting style). The second and fourth translations use \"Maintain the Stability of the Banking System\" and \"Maintain the stability of the banking system,\" respectively. The difference between \"Maintain\" and \"Maintaining\" is subtle but important: \"Maintaining\" implies an ongoing process, which is more consistent with the original Chinese, which uses the present participle form \"保持\" (to maintain).\nThe third translation omits the hashtag and uses lowercase, which may be appropriate in some contexts but is less formal and less likely to be used as a title. The sixth translation, \"Maintain financial system stability,\" is incorrect because it changes \"banking system\" to \"financial system,\" which alters the meaning of the original text.\nThe best translation should preserve the original meaning, use appropriate capitalization, and maintain the title format. \"Maintaining the Stability of the Banking System\" is the most accurate and natural translation, as it uses the present participle form, capitalizes the title appropriately, and retains the original meaning without unnecessary changes.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and structure. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which discusses the challenges posed by macroeconomic uncertainty and technological innovation to the banking system, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) response through policy guidance, communication, and regulatory improvements.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations use appropriate terminology, such as \"generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)\" and \"regulatory framework.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the argument.\n- The use of terms like \"resilience to various shocks\" and \"supervisory approach\" is accurate and natural in English.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning without ambiguity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"the Monetary Authority\" versus \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which may affect clarity or consistency.\n- A few translations use \"maintaining continuous regulatory engagement and communication\" or \"maintaining continuous regulatory communication and engagement,\" which are slightly redundant or awkward in phrasing.\n- The phrase \"in response to technological developments, changing customer expectations, and international standards and best practices\" appears in multiple translations, but \"evolving\" or \"changing\" may be more natural depending on context.\n- Some translations use \"supervisory approach\" while others use \"supervisory model,\" which are both acceptable but may vary in nuance.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the full name and acronym of the HKMA.\n- Use more natural phrasing for regulatory communication, such as \"sustained regulatory engagement and dialogue.\"\n- Use \"evolving\" instead of \"changing\" for \"customer expectations\" to reflect a more gradual and ongoing process.\n- Ensure that the final sentence uses consistent terminology, such as \"supervisory framework\" or \"supervisory model,\" depending on the intended nuance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the ongoing development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits but also introduce new operational and technological risks for banks. In response to this environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strive to enhance banks' resilience against various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as maintaining sustained regulatory engagement and dialogue with individual banks and the broader industry. Simultaneously, we will continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory framework and supervisory model in line with technological advancements, evolving customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 風險為本的監管重點,\" which translates to a heading or title. The junior translators have provided several variations of \"Risk-Based Regulatory Focus,\" with minor differences in capitalization and punctuation.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate lexical choices (\"risk-based\" and \"regulatory focus\" are appropriate terms in regulatory contexts). However, there are notable weaknesses:\n1. **Capitalization and Punctuation:** The use of all caps (\"Risk-Based\") is inconsistent and not standard in English for such headings unless it's a title case or part of a specific style guide. The original Chinese uses a hashtag (#), which is not typically used in formal English headings unless in digital or social media contexts.\n2. **Semantic Nuance:** The term \"focus\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"重點\" (priority or emphasis). A more natural and precise translation might be \"Priorities\" or \"Emphasis.\"\n3. **Consistency and Style:** The translations lack consistency in formatting. Some include the hashtag, others do not, and capitalization varies. A professional translation should maintain a consistent style and adhere to standard English conventions for headings.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nUnder pressure in the credit environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly in areas such as loan classification and provisioning, as well as the management of problem loans. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, and encourage authorized institutions to continue supporting the real economy while upholding the primary principle of prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original Chinese text, which discusses the increased volatility in global financial markets due to uncertain interest rates and geopolitical tensions, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) proactive measures to manage market and liquidity risks in authorized institutions. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to institutional terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key factors contributing to market volatility: uncertain interest rates and geopolitical tensions.\n- They all mention the HKMA's proactive approach to market risk management and the review of liquidity risk management in response to macroeconomic uncertainty and digitalization.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Institutional Terminology:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" (Translation 6) or \"Monetary Authority\" (Translation 4) instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is the correct and commonly used term in official contexts.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Phrases like \"take a proactive approach to supervise\" (Translation 1) or \"take proactive measures to supervise\" (Translation 2) are slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"take a proactive approach in supervising\" or \"take proactive measures to oversee.\"\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat the phrase \"in light of this\" or \"in response to,\" which can be simplified for better flow.\n- **Nuance and Precision:** The original text uses \"認可機構\" (authorized institutions), which should be consistently translated as such. Translation 6 uses \"regulated institutions,\" which is less precise in this context.\n- **Terminology Consistency:** \"Sudden capital flows\" (Translation 1) and \"sudden cash flow fluctuations\" (Translation 4 and 5) are slightly different in nuance. \"Sudden capital flows\" is more aligned with the original's \"突發性資金流.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct and consistent institutional name: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"take a proactive approach in overseeing\" or \"take proactive measures to oversee.\"\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, particularly with \"authorized institutions\" and \"market risk management.\"\n- Use \"sudden capital flows\" to align with the original's phrasing and financial terminology.\n- Avoid redundancy by varying sentence structures where possible.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, with adjustments for clarity, consistency, and natural English expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nUncertainty over interest rates in major advanced economies, combined with heightened geopolitical tensions, has led to increased volatility in global financial markets. In light of this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to take a proactive approach in overseeing the market risk management of authorized institutions. In response to the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the growing digitization of banking services, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risk to strengthen their ability to handle sudden capital flows.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\nThe original Chinese text, \"# 業務操作及科技風險,\" translates to \"Business Operations and Technology Risks.\" The junior translators have mostly captured this accurately, with only minor variations. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations are all correct, though the sixth uses \"Operational\" instead of \"Business Operations,\" which is slightly more concise but may be less precise depending on the context. The fourth translation includes a hashtag, which matches the original text's formatting, but the use of \"Risk\" (singular) instead of \"Risks\" (plural) is inconsistent with the original Chinese, which uses the plural form \"風險.\"\nThe best translation should maintain the original structure and terminology while ensuring clarity and natural English usage. \"Business Operations and Technology Risks\" is the most accurate and natural translation, as it directly reflects the original Chinese terms and uses the correct plural form. It is also the most commonly used phrasing in professional and regulatory contexts, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to improve the banking system's operational resilience by reviewing banks' progress in identifying and addressing risks to critical operations. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and fluent, using \"operational resilience framework\" correctly and maintaining the structure of the original. However, it uses \"as part of its implementation,\" which is slightly awkward.\nTranslation 2 misinterprets the original by changing \"identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations\" to \"identifying, maintaining, and addressing potential risks to critical operations,\" which alters the meaning.\nTranslation 3 is mostly accurate but uses \"their implementation\" instead of \"its implementation,\" which is incorrect since the implementation is done by the HKMA, not the banks.\nTranslation 4 is very close to the original, using \"remedial actions\" instead of \"corrective actions,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in this context. It also uses \"its implementation\" correctly.\nTranslation 5 is accurate but uses \"their implementation\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"an operational resilience framework\" instead of \"the operational resilience framework,\" which is less precise.\nTranslation 6 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"soundness\" instead of \"operational resilience,\" which changes the nuance of the original.\nConsidering these points, the best translation should use the correct name for the authority, maintain the precise terminology, and ensure grammatical accuracy. The phrase \"operational resilience framework\" should be used with the definite article \"the\" to reflect that it is a specific framework being implemented.\nThe improved translation should be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue its work to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking system, reviewing the progress made by banks in identifying potential risks to critical operations and taking corrective actions, as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking industry on third-party service providers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will further strengthen banks' management of third-party risks by developing new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several observations can be made regarding their strengths and weaknesses. All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiatives in cyber resilience, including the \"cyber map\" project, collaboration with financial regulators, and the implementation of data backup and testing frameworks.\nStrengths include the consistent use of key terms such as \"cyber resilience,\" \"systemic cyber risks,\" and \"cross-sectoral\" or \"inter-sectoral\" to describe the collaborative nature of the project. The translations also accurately reflect the intent of the original text in promoting banks' ability to restore critical operations during cyber incidents.\nHowever, there are notable differences in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and precision. For instance, \"network defense resilience\" (used in translations 4 and 6) is less standard than \"cyber resilience\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, and 5). The term \"cyber resilience\" is more commonly used in cybersecurity contexts and is preferred for clarity and consistency.\nThe term \"inter-sectoral\" (translation 2) is slightly more formal than \"cross-sectoral\" (used in translations 1, 3, 5, and 6), but both are acceptable. However, \"cross-sectoral\" is more widely used in policy and regulatory contexts.\nThe phrase \"robust triple data backup\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, and 6) is a direct translation of the Chinese term, but \"three-fold data backup\" (translation 5) is more idiomatic in English. However, \"triple data backup\" is also understandable and may be more precise in the context of the original text.\nThe use of \"initiative\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 6) versus \"project\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is a minor variation, but \"project\" is more specific and appropriate in this context.\nThe phrase \"in accordance with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 6) is accurate, but \"following recommendations from the International Monetary Fund\" (translation 5) is slightly more concise.\nThe use of \"enhance banks' ability\" (translations 1, 2, 6) versus \"encourage banks to strengthen their ability\" (translations 2, 3, 5) reflects different nuances. \"Enhance\" is more direct and commonly used in regulatory contexts, while \"encourage... to strengthen\" is slightly more indirect.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"cyber resilience\" consistently, \"cross-sectoral\" to describe the project, \"robust triple data backup\" as the term for the backup arrangement, and \"enhance banks' ability\" to convey the goal of the testing framework. The translation should also maintain a formal and professional tone, consistent with the original text's regulatory context.\nHere is the improved translation:\nRegarding cyber resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will assess systemic cyber risks through a cross-sectoral \"Cyber Map\" project. This project is being jointly advanced by the HKMA and other local financial regulators in accordance with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund. In addition, we will review the implementation of banks' \"robust triple data backup\" arrangements and introduce a cyber resilience testing framework to enhance banks' ability to restore critical operations in the event of severe cyber incidents.\n\nWhile all six translations capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality. \nThe first junior translator uses \"acknowledge\" and \"application of these technologies,\" which are accurate but slightly formal. The second and third translations use \"noted\" and \"monitor emerging risks,\" which are more active and precise. The fourth and fifth translations use \"brought about by the broader adoption,\" which is slightly more natural than \"brought by the widespread adoption.\" The sixth translation uses \"have noted\" and \"remain vigilant in monitoring,\" which is slightly more passive and less concise.\nThe most consistent and natural phrasing is found in translations 2, 3, 4, and 5, which use \"monitor emerging risks\" and \"provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\" However, the use of \"noted\" in translation 2 and \"recognize\" in translations 3, 4, and 5 are both acceptable, though \"recognize\" may be slightly more appropriate in a formal context.\nThe phrase \"remain vigilant, monitor emerging risks\" is slightly repetitive in translations 2, 3, and 4. A more concise and fluent structure would be \"remain vigilant in monitoring emerging risks.\"\nThe best version would combine the clarity of \"recognize the benefits brought about by the broader adoption\" with the active and precise phrasing of \"remain vigilant in monitoring emerging risks and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is:\nWhile we recognize the benefits brought about by the broader adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI in the banking sector, we will remain vigilant in monitoring emerging risks and provide guidance on the use of such technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with industry stakeholders and other relevant parties to remain agile and proactive in preventing issues before they arise, thereby enhancing the bank's ability to combat digital fraud and guard against ever-evolving fraudulent tactics.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce institutional reforms, innovative measures, and other initiatives to enhance Hong Kong's overall capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, mitigate the threats posed by illicit financial flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the government's cross-departmental collaboration, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong, to deepen our understanding of potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidance based on the assessment results, in alignment with the implementation of the new stablecoin issuer regulatory framework.\nAs part of the government's cross-departmental collaboration, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong, to deepen our understanding of potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidance based on the assessment results, in alignment with the implementation of the new stablecoin issuer regulatory framework.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that deliver public value. This involves strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activities, enabling banks to identify and prevent more fraud and shell accounts, thereby further increasing the quality and usefulness of actionable intelligence submitted to law enforcement agencies for follow-up actions.\n\nTo strengthen our efforts to combat fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendments to create the required pathways and safeguards for banks to share personal account information. To enhance the speed and scale of detecting illicit fund flows, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will commence work on a payment data analytics platform.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Related Services\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will conduct on-site and off-site examinations of the conduct of authorized institutions in relation to securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses. Particular attention will be given to high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long-term insurance products, and premium financing activities, while taking into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that warrant a critical review.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reflect its role in maintaining communication with regulatory bodies and the banking sector.\n- The phrase \"sustainable and responsible development\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and aligns with the original intent.\n- The term \"digital assets industry\" is used consistently across most translations, with only one using \"digital asset sector,\" which is also acceptable.\n- The use of terms like \"robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework\" is accurate and well-chosen.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The first and third translations use \"Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" with the full form in parentheses, which is good for clarity. However, the second and fifth translations use \"MPF\" without explanation, which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the term. The sixth translation uses \"occupational retirement schemes\" instead of \"Mandatory Provident Fund,\" which is a less precise and more general term.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** The first translation uses \"providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investment, insurance, and mandatory Provident Fund products as needed,\" which is slightly awkward in structure. The second and fifth translations use \"as needed\" more naturally. The sixth translation uses \"investments\" instead of \"investment,\" which is a minor grammatical inconsistency.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"HKMA\" versus \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is a matter of style. While both are acceptable, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more formal and may be preferred in official contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the full form \"Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" with the acronym in parentheses for clarity.\n- Ensure consistent use of \"digital assets industry\" or \"digital asset industry\" to maintain consistency with the original.\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for formality and clarity.\n- Ensure grammatical consistency, such as using \"investment\" rather than \"investments\" when referring to the singular concept.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent structure, avoiding overly wordy or awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also maintain close contact with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector to provide guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investment, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital assets industry, we will continue to collaborate with the government and other regulatory authorities to ensure the establishment of a robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework for the digital assets industry.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will promote and monitor the implementation of optimization measures for the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" by the industry, and will continue to liaise with industry stakeholders and relevant regulatory authorities to further optimize the scheme and other bank-related cross-border initiatives.\n\nWe will also integrate and clarify existing guidelines related to wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) services as needed, enabling the industry to better understand the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory requirements and facilitating compliance.\n\n# Policy Formulation\n\n# Implementing the Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe original text discusses the implementation of the final reform package of Basel III in Hong Kong and the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in providing guidance and clarification to ensure consistent adoption by the industry.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. However, \"final reform proposal\" may not be the most precise term for the Basel III reform, which is more commonly referred to as a \"reform package\" or \"reforms.\" The use of \"interpretive issues\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the original in meaning and tone. \"Final reforms to Basel III\" is a natural phrasing. The use of \"across the industry\" is slightly more natural than \"by the industry.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The use of \"Basel III Accord\" is slightly more formal than necessary. \"Reform package\" is appropriate. The structure is clear, but \"ensuring consistent adoption by the industry\" is slightly less natural than \"ensuring consistent adoption across the industry.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This is a strong translation. The use of \"provide guidance and clarification\" is natural. \"Regarding common issues in the interpretation\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is a very strong translation. The use of \"licensed institutions\" is more precise than \"authorized institutions\" in the context of financial regulation. \"Across the industry\" is a natural choice. The phrasing is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. However, the phrase \"to authorized institutions\" at the end of the sentence is awkwardly placed. The use of \"uniformly adopts the proposal\" is slightly less natural than \"consistently adopts the proposal.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"reform package\" to accurately reflect the nature of Basel III reforms, use \"licensed institutions\" for precision, and employ natural phrasing such as \"across the industry\" and \"ensuring consistent adoption.\" It should also maintain a formal yet fluent tone appropriate for regulatory texts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe final reform package of Basel III will take effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to provide guidance and clarification to licensed institutions regarding common interpretive issues related to the final reform package, ensuring its consistent adoption across the industry.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and phrasing. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, consistency, and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core information, including the Basel Committee's actions, the timeline of events, and the HKMA's planned responses.\n- The terminology used for financial regulations and procedures is largely consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is clear and follows a logical flow, making the content easy to understand.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different phrasing for similar concepts, such as \"prudently manage risks\" vs. \"prudential treatment of risks\" or \"preferential regulatory treatment\" vs. \"favorable regulatory treatment.\" While these are all acceptable, consistency in terminology would improve readability.\n- There is some variation in the titles of the documents and rules, such as \"Disclosure of Risks Associated with Crypto Assets\" vs. \"Disclosure of Crypto-Asset Risk Exposures.\" Ensuring consistency in the naming of these documents is important for clarity.\n- Some translations use \"statutory consultation\" while others use \"public consultation\" or \"formal consultation.\" While these terms are related, \"statutory consultation\" is more precise in the context of regulatory changes.\n- The phrase \"risk exposure limits\" appears in some translations, while others use \"risk limitation\" or \"exposure limits.\" Again, consistency in terminology is key.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the translation, such as using \"prudential treatment\" or \"prudent management\" consistently.\n- Ensure that the titles of documents and rules are consistently translated, such as using \"Disclosure of Crypto-Asset Risk Exposure\" throughout.\n- Use \"statutory consultation\" to reflect the formal nature of the process in regulatory contexts.\n- Ensure that the rules are consistently named, such as using \"Risk Exposure Limits Rules\" or \"Exposure Limits Rules\" consistently.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, consistency, and natural English phrasing while accurately reflecting the original Chinese text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn December 2022, the Basel Committee issued new standards for banks' prudent management of risks associated with crypto assets, followed by targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. At the same time, the Basel Committee published a document titled \"Disclosure of Crypto-Asset Risk Exposure,\" outlining updated disclosure requirements for crypto-asset risk exposures. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will study the necessary legislative amendments to various rules, including the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules (Risk Exposure Limits Rules), and Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose several optimization suggestions for the Risk Exposure Limits Rules based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will conduct a statutory consultation on the proposed amendments in the first half of 2025, aiming to implement the new standards by January 1, 2026, in accordance with the Basel Committee's timeline. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking reporting forms and supporting guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the new standards by authorized institutions.\n\n# Other Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches, and developments in the banking industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to update several sections of the *Regulatory Policy Manual*, including CA-G-5 \"Supervisory Review Process,\" CA-B-2 \"Systemically Important Banks,\" IC-5 \"Stress Testing,\" IR-1 \"Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book,\" and IC-3 \"Requirements for Reports by External Auditors of Authorized Institutions under the Banking Ordinance.\" The section CR-G-13 \"Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" of the *Regulatory Policy Manual* will be revised to reflect the sound practices outlined in the Basel Committee's \"Guidelines on Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" issued in December 2024.\n\n# The original title, \"# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則,\" translates to a heading that outlines the core principles established by the Basel Committee for the effective regulation of the banking sector. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"The Basel Committee's Main Principles for the Effective Regulation of the Banking Sector\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, \"Main Principles\" may not be the most precise term in this context, as \"core\" or \"key\" might better reflect the foundational nature of these principles.\nTranslation 2: \"# Main Principles of Effective Banking Supervision by the Basel Committee\" is concise and uses \"supervision\" instead of \"regulation,\" which is a common term in banking contexts. However, the use of \"by\" may slightly alter the emphasis, suggesting the Basel Committee is the actor performing the supervision rather than establishing principles for it.\nTranslation 3: \"The Basel Committee's Key Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" is well-structured and uses \"Key Principles,\" which is a commonly used term in regulatory contexts. However, it omits the word \"regulation\" and uses \"supervision\" instead, which, while related, may not fully capture the original intent.\nTranslation 4: \"# Key Principles of the Basel Committee for Effective Regulation of the Banking Industry\" is accurate and uses \"Key Principles\" effectively. However, \"Banking Industry\" is slightly broader than \"Banking Sector,\" which may not be the most precise term in this context.\nTranslation 5: \"Basel Committee's Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" is concise and uses \"Core Principles,\" which is a strong term in regulatory contexts. However, it omits the possessive \"The\" and uses \"supervision\" instead of \"regulation.\"\nTranslation 6: \"# The Basel Committee's Key Principles for Effective Supervision of the Banking Industry\" is well-structured and uses \"Key Principles\" effectively. However, it uses \"supervision\" and \"Banking Industry\" instead of \"regulation\" and \"Banking Sector,\" which may slightly alter the nuance.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use \"Core Principles\" or \"Key Principles\" to reflect the foundational nature of the principles, include \"regulation\" to accurately reflect the original term, and use \"Banking Sector\" for precision. It should also maintain the heading format with the \"#\" symbol.\nThe Basel Committee's Core Principles for the Effective Regulation of the Banking Sector\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Basel Committee as the issuer of the revised document and accurately note the date (April 2024).\n- The term \"Core Principles\" is consistently used, with appropriate quotation marks or italics in most translations.\n- The mention of the 2012 revision and the impact of structural trends on banks and banking systems is accurately reflected in all versions.\n- The reference to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducting a self-assessment in 2025 is present in all translations, with slight variations in wording (e.g., \"thorough,\" \"detailed,\" \"comprehensive\").\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The title of the document is translated as either \"Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" or \"Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.\" The original Chinese text uses the term “主要原則” (Core Principles), which is best translated as \"Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" to reflect the official title.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"supervision and regulation\" instead of \"regulation and supervision,\" which is a minor but noticeable difference in phrasing. The order of terms may affect the natural flow in English.\n- **Consistency in Abbreviations:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" For consistency, it is preferable to use the full name unless the abbreviation has been previously established in the text.\n- **Use of Quotation Marks:** Some translations use double quotation marks (\"\") while others use single quotation marks (''). In formal writing, double quotation marks are more standard unless otherwise specified.\n- **Word Choice:** The adjectives used to describe the self-assessment vary (e.g., \"thorough,\" \"detailed,\" \"comprehensive\"). \"Comprehensive\" is the most natural and formal choice in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality.\n- Maintain the official title of the document as \"Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" with appropriate quotation marks.\n- Use \"regulation and supervision\" in the correct order for natural English phrasing.\n- Choose \"comprehensive\" as the most appropriate adjective for the self-assessment.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of quotation marks and terminology throughout the translation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised \"Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" (the \"Core Principles\") in April 2024. The revised Core Principles reflect developments in regulation and supervision since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its regulatory and supervisory framework aligns with the revised Core Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe original text discusses the International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB) plan to issue a document on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025 and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) role in studying the impact of the proposed model on prudential regulations.\nAmong the translations, the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth junior translators have produced versions that are largely accurate and fluent. However, there are notable differences in terminology and institutional names that affect the precision of the translation.\nThe first, third, fifth, and sixth translators use \"consultation draft,\" while the second and sixth use \"exposure draft.\" In the context of accounting standards, \"exposure draft\" is the more precise term used by the IASB when issuing preliminary proposals for public comment. \"Consultation draft\" is less standard in this context and may be misleading.\nThe fourth and fifth translators use \"discussion paper,\" which is also not the standard term used by the IASB for this type of document. The correct term is \"exposure draft.\"\nAdditionally, the fourth translator incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct regulatory body in Hong Kong responsible for prudential regulation.\nThe fifth and sixth translators capitalize \"Dynamic Risk Management\" consistently, which is appropriate for a specific term or model. The first, second, and third translators use lowercase for \"dynamic risk management\" after the first mention, which is less consistent with formal writing standards.\nBased on these observations, the best translation should use \"exposure draft\" as the correct term for the IASB's document, refer to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" accurately, and maintain consistent capitalization for the model name.\nThe final translation should be precise, fluent, and culturally appropriate, reflecting the formal tone of regulatory and accounting documents.\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an exposure draft on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will collaborate with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed Dynamic Risk Management accounting model on existing prudential regulatory requirements.\n\n# Law Enforcement\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulting the banking industry in 2024 on proposals to expand the investigative and enforcement powers of the Financial Management Officer, with the aim of ensuring he retains the necessary authority to perform his duties under the Banking Ordinance. The HKMA will then adjust the proposals and draft legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"Banking Ordinance.\" However, it uses \"they\" to refer to the Financial Management Officer, which is grammatically incorrect since the officer is singular. The use of \"they still possess\" is inconsistent with the singular subject.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Management Officer.\" This is a critical error, as the Financial Secretary is a different role in Hong Kong's government. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"financial regulators\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer,\" which is vague and less precise. It also uses \"they\" to refer to the officer, which is grammatically incorrect. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is not the correct title for the Financial Management Officer. It also uses \"he\" consistently, which is correct, but the title is inaccurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using the correct title \"Financial Management Officer\" and referring to him with \"he.\" It also uses \"views\" instead of \"opinions,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable. The structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"its officers\" instead of specifying \"the Financial Management Officer,\" which is vague and less precise. It also uses \"refine\" instead of \"adjust,\" which is slightly different in nuance but still acceptable. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct title \"Financial Management Officer,\" refer to him with \"he\" consistently, and avoid vague or incorrect terms. It should also maintain a formal and professional tone, as befits a government consultation process. The fifth junior translator's version is the closest to this standard, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority consulted the banking industry in 2024 on proposals to expand the investigative and enforcement powers of the Financial Management Officer, to ensure that he still possesses the necessary authority to effectively perform his duties under the Banking Ordinance. After considering the views received during the consultation, the HKMA will revise the proposals and prepare necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Handling Mechanism\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing multi-year project to establish a resolution mechanism for authorized institutions, with a focus on prioritized areas of work in 2025. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"resolution regime\" and \"authorized institutions,\" which are appropriate terms in financial regulation. It is concise and natural.\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"handling actions against licensed institutions,\" which is less precise than \"resolution mechanism.\"\n- **Translation 3** is mostly accurate but uses \"recognized institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which may not be the exact term used in the original context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"disposal of recognized institutions,\" which may be misinterpreted as liquidation or sale, rather than the regulatory resolution process.\n- **Translation 5** is accurate and concise, using \"efficient mechanism for handling authorized institutions,\" which is appropriate.\n- **Translation 6** is accurate but omits the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in the first sentence, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct full name of the organization, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" and the precise term \"resolution mechanism\" to reflect the regulatory process. It should also maintain fluency and clarity, avoiding ambiguous or overly literal phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is continuing to implement a multi-year project to establish a well-functioning resolution mechanism for authorized institutions. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritize work in the following areas (Table 1):\n\nTable 1 Key Priorities of the 2025 Disposal Mechanism\n\n# Disposal Policy and Standards\n\n- Consult on the chapter of the Code of Practice concerning the approach taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in valuing assets during disposal, as well as the prior capabilities and arrangements that authorized institutions must have in place to support timely and prudent disposal valuations, and complete the relevant drafting work.  \n- Advance the development of policy standards for disposal and restructuring.\n\n# International and Cross-Border Cooperation\n\nParticipate in work related to the development and effective implementation of international resolution policies, particularly the Financial Stability Board’s planned 12 resolution mechanism reforms for 2025, which will be carried out through its Resolution Mechanisms Supervisory Group and various working groups.\n"}

The junior translators have attempted to convey this information, but several issues arise in terms of accuracy, clarity, and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the Legislative Council (LC) and the Financial Secretary (FS), but incorrectly refers to the Financial Secretary as the \"Chief Executive of the Exchange Fund.\" This is a misinterpretation of the role of the Financial Management Secretary, who was appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. Additionally, the term \"Colonial Secretary\" is inaccurate in this context.\n**Translation 2** contains a logical error by stating that the Financial Secretary was authorized to appoint the Financial Secretary, which is nonsensical and likely a result of a copy-paste or formatting error.\n**Translation 3** misidentifies the former title of the Financial Secretary as \"Financial Commissioner\" and incorrectly states that the Financial Secretary was appointed by the Financial Secretary, which is illogical.\n**Translation 4** repeats the phrase \"formerly known as the Legislative Council,\" which is redundant. It also incorrectly refers to the Financial Secretary as the \"Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is not accurate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Exchange Fund Bill\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is a legal misnomer. It also refers to the former title as \"Treasurer,\" which is not historically accurate for the role of the Financial Secretary in Hong Kong.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Financial Superintendent\" instead of \"Financial Management Secretary\" or \"Commissioner of Financial Management,\" which is not the correct title. It also uses \"Financial Secretary (formerly Financial Secretary),\" which is redundant.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations are essential:\n- Accurate use of legal terminology, such as \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" and \"Financial Management Secretary.\"\n- Correct historical titles, such as \"Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Commissioner).\"\n- Clear and logical sentence structure to avoid redundancy and confusion.\n- Proper use of terms like \"authorized to appoint the Commissioner of Financial Management.\"\n- Ensuring that the establishment of the HKMA is clearly linked to the legislative action in 1992.\nThe best translation would be:\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Council) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Commissioner) to appoint the Commissioner of Financial Management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe original text outlines the legal basis for the powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management Commissioner, referencing several key ordinances. It also mentions an exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Commissioner in 2003, which details the division of roles and the delegation of powers, and notes that this document is publicly available on the HKMA website.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Management Commissioner.\" Also, it uses \"Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" which is not an accurate title. The term \"letter of exchange\" is awkward and not standard in this context.\n2. **Second Translation:** Correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and accurately references the relevant ordinances. The phrase \"exchange of letters\" is appropriate, and the translation is fluent and accurate. However, it uses \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner\" in the second sentence, which is a minor error.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"Financial Management Specialist\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" which is incorrect. Also, it uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Ordinance\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is not the official title. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Commissioner of Financial Services\" and uses \"Currency and Foreign Exchanges Ordinance,\" which is not the correct title. The rest of the translation is fluent but contains inaccuracies in titles and ordinance names.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" as the subject of the powers and responsibilities, which is not accurate. The HKMA is the institution that oversees the Financial Management Commissioner, not the entity itself. The translation is otherwise fluent.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Similar to the fifth, it incorrectly attributes the powers and responsibilities to the HKMA. It uses \"roles\" instead of \"functions,\" which is slightly less precise. However, it is the most accurate in terms of the date format and the use of \"exchange of letters.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, using the correct titles for the Financial Management Commissioner and the relevant ordinances. It should also use standard legal terminology, such as \"exchange of letters\" and \"delegation of powers.\" The date format should be consistent (e.g., \"25 June 2003\"), and the reference to the HKMA website should be clear and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management Commissioner are explicitly stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Commissioner dated 25 June 2003 outlines the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Financial Management Commissioner. This correspondence is a public document and is available for reference on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical precision that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Exchange Fund as being established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and controlled by the Financial Secretary.\n- The key function of the Fund—primarily influencing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate—is consistently captured.\n- The secondary function of maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system is also well represented.\n- The parenthetical note about considering the Fund’s primary purpose is included in all translations, though with slight variations in wording.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the \"Exchange Fund,\" which is a significant factual error.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"must primarily be used to influence,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"shall primarily be used for influencing\" or \"shall primarily be used to influence.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"deploy\" and \"integrity\" instead of \"use\" and \"soundness,\" which are stylistic choices that may be less precise in this context.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"should primarily be used\" instead of \"shall\" or \"must,\" which may imply a weaker obligation than intended by the original text.\n- Some translations use \"financial centre\" with an \"s\" (e.g., \"financial centres\"), which is inconsistent with the original text that uses \"financial center\" without the \"s.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use of \"shall\" is more formal and appropriate in legal or regulatory contexts, aligning with the tone of the original text.\n- \"Soundness\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"integrity\" or \"stability.\"\n- \"Financial center\" should be used without the \"s\" to match the original.\n- The phrase \"while at the same time taking into account\" is more natural than \"while also considering.\"\n- The phrase \"maintaining Hong Kong's status\" is slightly more natural than \"preserving Hong Kong's status,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system (while at the same time taking into account the Exchange Fund's main purpose), thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nThe original text outlines the appointment and role of the Financial Management Commissioner under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, as well as the structure of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have attempted to convey this information, but their translations vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Financial Controller\" and \"Chief Executive,\" which are not the standard terms used in Hong Kong's official context. The term \"Financial Controller\" is not commonly used for this role, and \"Chief Executive\" is more associated with the head of a company or a government body like the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"Chief Executive,\" which is closer to the intended meaning but still not the standard title. The term \"Currency Fund Ordinance\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n**Translation 3** incorrectly refers to the appointee as \"Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original text. The original text refers to the \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" not a \"Financial Secretary.\"\n**Translation 4** uses \"Financial Management Specialist\" and \"Financial Management Bureau,\" which are not standard terms in this context. Additionally, \"Exchange Fund Bill\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n**Translation 5** correctly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is the most accurate translation in terms of terminology and structure. However, \"Chairman\" is not the standard title for the head of the HKMA; the correct title is \"Chief Executive.\"\n**Translation 6** incorrectly states that the \"Financial Secretary\" is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the \"Chief Financial Secretary,\" which is a logical error. The original text clearly states that the Financial Management Commissioner is appointed to assist the Financial Secretary.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct title \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and refer to the head of the HKMA as the \"Chief Executive.\" The term \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" must be used consistently, and the structure should clearly reflect the appointment and role of the Financial Management Commissioner.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Commissioner, appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, assists the Financial Secretary in performing the functions conferred upon him by that Ordinance, as well as other functions under other Ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Management Commissioner is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Financial Management Commissioner is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe original text refers to the \"金融管理專員\" (Commissioner of Banking), a specific official role in Hong Kong's financial regulatory framework. However, several junior translators have incorrectly identified this role as the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau,\" \"Financial Regulator,\" \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" or even \"Commissioner of Banking\" in some cases. This inconsistency is a critical issue, as the correct title is \"Commissioner of Banking,\" which is used in the fifth and sixth translations.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, the translations vary. The first and sixth translations are the most grammatically sound and fluent. However, the sixth translation uses \"oversight and regulation\" and \"licensing and recognition,\" which are slightly more formal and may not fully align with the original's intent. The fifth translation is also accurate, using \"Commissioner of Banking\" correctly and maintaining a clear structure.\nThe use of \"licensing\" versus \"authorization\" or \"recognition\" is another point of variation. The original text uses \"認可事宜\" (matters of authorization or recognition), which is best captured by \"handling the authorization\" or \"matters relating to the authorization\" as in the fifth translation.\nCulturally, it is important to use the official title \"Commissioner of Banking\" to ensure clarity and accuracy in the context of Hong Kong's regulatory framework. The term \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" refers to a different government department and is therefore incorrect in this context.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would use the correct title \"Commissioner of Banking,\" maintain grammatical accuracy, and use appropriate terminology such as \"authorization\" to reflect the original's intent.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Commissioner of Banking regulates and supervises banking and deposit-taking businesses in accordance with the duties and powers conferred by the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Commissioner of Banking is responsible for handling the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe original text outlines the legal framework under which the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates a specific authority to manage the orderly resolution of failing banking entities, with the aim of maintaining financial stability and protecting public funds.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the title of the ordinance and correctly identifies the \"Financial Institutions Authority\" as the resolution authority. The translation is fluent and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Institutions Authority\" is not a standard term in Hong Kong's regulatory framework. The correct term is \"Financial Secretary\" or \"Financial Services Secretary,\" depending on the context.  \n2. **Second Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Financial Management Specialist,\" which is a more accurate term than \"Financial Institutions Authority.\" The translation is fluent and conveys the intent well.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Management Specialist\" is not a standard title in Hong Kong's legal or regulatory context. The term \"Financial Secretary\" is more appropriate.  \n3. **Third Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the \"Financial Secretary\" as the authority. The translation is fluent and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to \"financial institutions\" instead of \"banking entities,\" which is a key distinction in the original text.  \n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Financial Services Secretary,\" which is a more precise term than \"Financial Secretary\" in the context of financial regulation. The translation is fluent and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"financially unsustainable financial institutions\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.  \n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the \"Financial Secretary\" and uses \"banking entities\" as in the original. The translation is fluent and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term \"Financial Secretary\" may not be the most precise in the context of resolution mechanisms.  \n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Financial Secretary\" and accurately conveys the intent of the original text. The translation is fluent and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"financial institution entities\" is redundant and could be simplified to \"financial institutions.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should use the correct title for the authority, which is \"Financial Secretary\" in the context of Hong Kong's legal framework. It should also accurately reflect the distinction between \"banking entities\" and \"financial institutions\" as used in the original text. The phrase \"orderly resolution\" is standard in regulatory contexts and should be retained. The sentence structure should be clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance stipulates that the Financial Secretary is the resolution authority for banking entities. The Financial Secretary is granted a range of powers to carry out orderly resolution of banking entities that are no longer viable (the collapse of which could pose a systemic risk), in order to maintain financial stability while striving to protect public funds.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators mostly capture the core meaning. However, there are notable differences in terminology and title accuracy that affect the quality and appropriateness of the translations.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Secretary for Financial Services,\" which is not the correct title in Hong Kong's official structure. The correct title is \"Financial Services Commissioner.\"\n**Translation 2** correctly uses \"Financial Services Commissioner\" and \"mandatory provident fund schemes,\" which is accurate and consistent with the original text. The use of \"relating to\" is appropriate and natural.\n**Translation 3** uses \"Financial Management Authority,\" which is not the correct title. The correct term is \"Financial Services Commissioner.\" Also, \"businesses\" is slightly less precise than \"schemes\" or \"operations.\"\n**Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"Financial Secretary,\" which is a different role in Hong Kong's government structure. This is a significant error in title accuracy.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 2 and is also accurate in terms of title and terminology. It uses \"activities,\" which is slightly more general than \"schemes\" but still acceptable.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Financial Services Authority,\" which is not the correct title. The correct term is \"Financial Services Commissioner.\" Additionally, \"schemes\" is appropriate but \"operations\" or \"businesses\" might be more aligned with the original wording.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct title \"Financial Services Commissioner\" and accurately reflect the original terminology. The phrase \"relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund schemes\" is precise and natural. The verb \"confer upon\" is more formal and appropriate in a legal context than \"grant\" or \"empower.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer upon the Financial Services Commissioner certain powers relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund schemes.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the Insurance Authority as the delegator, the Financial Services Commissioner as the delegatee, and the Insurance Ordinance as the legal basis. The structure is clear and natural in English legal terminology.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but contains a critical error: \"Financial Secretary\" is incorrect. In Hong Kong's context, the correct title is \"Financial Services Commissioner,\" not \"Financial Secretary.\" This is a significant misrepresentation of the role.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first and is also accurate and fluent. It uses slightly different phrasing (\"delegates to the Financial Services Commissioner the powers of inspection and investigation\") but conveys the same meaning clearly.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation introduces an error by mentioning \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau officers,\" which is not present in the original text. This addition is misleading and unnecessary, and the phrase \"investigative and inquiry powers\" is redundant and less precise than \"inspection and investigation powers.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is incorrect in referring to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Services Commissioner,\" similar to the second translation. This is a critical error in the context of Hong Kong's regulatory framework.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation incorrectly identifies the delegatee as the \"Financial Services Oversight Council,\" which is not mentioned in the original text. The correct entity is the \"Financial Services Commissioner.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original legal structure, use correct terminology, and maintain fluency and clarity. The first and third translations are the most accurate, with the third being slightly more natural in phrasing. However, the first translation is more concise and precise in its use of \"delegates inspection and investigatory powers.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Insurance Authority delegates inspection and investigatory powers regarding the insurance-related business of banks to the Financial Services Commissioner pursuant to the Insurance Ordinance.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to legal terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"Financial Secretary,\" which is not the correct title in Hong Kong's context. The correct term is \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" or \"Financial Secretary\" in a broader governmental sense, but in the context of financial regulation, \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" is more precise. Also, \"supervise banks in complying\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"Secretary for Financial Services,\" which is not a standard title. The correct term is \"Financial Secretary\" or \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\" \"Supervise banks’ compliance\" is more concise and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"Undertaking of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance,\" which is an incorrect title. The correct title is \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.\" Also, \"Financial Secretary\" is not the correct regulatory body.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct regulatory body in Hong Kong. The correct body is the \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" or the \"Financial Secretary.\" However, the phrasing \"supervise banks’ compliance\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance,\" which is not the correct title. The correct title is \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.\" Also, \"Financial Services Regulatory Authority\" is not the correct body in Hong Kong.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"Combatting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance,\" which is not the correct title. The correct title is \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.\" \"Regulate banks' compliance\" is slightly less precise than \"supervise banks’ compliance.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The correct title is \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.\" The correct regulatory body in Hong Kong is the \"Financial Secretary\" or more precisely, the \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\" The verb \"supervise\" is more appropriate than \"regulate\" in this context. The phrase \"supervise banks’ compliance with the provisions of the Ordinance relating to customer due diligence and record-keeping\" is the most natural and accurate.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance authorizes the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to supervise banks’ compliance with the Ordinance’s provisions relating to customer due diligence and record-keeping.\n\nThe Deposits Insurance Scheme Ordinance confers on the Financial Secretary the responsibility to provide assistance in the operation of the deposit insurance scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation from the deposit insurance scheme fund to depositors of licensed banks that are unable to meet their obligations.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance, the Financial Management Officer may designate and supervise certain important settlement and clearing systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Management Officer to administer the licensing regime for electronic and physical \"tools\" used to store monetary value, provided they comply with the criteria specified in the Ordinance.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe first junior translator's version is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Officer\" as the official title, which is more precise than \"Commissioner of Financial Services\" or \"Financial Secretary\" used in other translations. The term \"settlement and clearing systems\" is also more accurate than \"clearing and settlement systems\" or \"significant clearing and settlement systems,\" as the original text uses the order \"結算及交收系統.\"\nThe use of \"tools\" in quotation marks is appropriate, as the original text uses the term \"工具\" in quotes, indicating a specific legal definition. Other translations use \"facilities\" or \"instruments,\" which may not capture the intended legal nuance.\nThe phrase \"provided they comply with the criteria specified in the Ordinance\" is more natural and grammatically correct than \"meeting the specified criteria under the Ordinance\" or \"which comply with the Ordinance’s specified criteria.\"\nThe second and third translations incorrectly use \"Commissioner of Financial Services\" and \"Financial Secretary,\" which are not the correct titles for the official responsible under the Ordinance. The term \"Financial Secretary\" is a high-ranking government official in Hong Kong, not the regulator of payment systems.\nThe fourth translation uses \"financial regulators\" in a general sense, which is vague and does not accurately reflect the specific role of the Financial Management Officer. It also uses \"facilities\" instead of \"tools,\" which may not align with the original term.\nThe fifth and sixth translations also use \"Financial Secretary\" and \"facilities,\" which are less accurate than \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"tools.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance, the Financial Management Officer may designate and supervise certain important settlement and clearing systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong.

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"uphold\" consistently and maintains a formal tone. However, \"institutional governance\" is repeated, which could be slightly refined for variety.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"recognizes\" instead of \"understands,\" which is slightly more formal and appropriate in this context. The use of \"the Authority\" adds clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and includes the acronym \"HKMA,\" which may be helpful for clarity. However, \"ability to fulfill\" is slightly less direct than \"fulfillment of.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the third, but uses \"preserving the public's trust\" instead of \"safeguarding public trust.\" While both are correct, \"safeguarding\" is more commonly used in governance contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation introduces \"de facto,\" which is not present in the original text and may be unnecessary or misleading. It also uses \"the highest standards,\" which is slightly more emphatic than the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and includes \"HKMA’s fulfillment of its statutory functions,\" which is slightly more precise than \"statutory duties.\" It also uses \"a high standard of institutional governance,\" which is slightly more natural than \"a high level of.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should be fluent, accurate, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should avoid unnecessary additions (like \"de facto\") and use precise vocabulary. It should also vary sentence structure slightly to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n**Improved translation**:\nAs Hong Kong's central banking institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfillment of statutory duties. Therefore, it has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to sound institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\n- Established a clear institutional governance framework;  \n- Maintained high accountability and transparency, and maintained close communication with all stakeholders; and  \n- Implemented robust and comprehensive monitoring measures to manage risks, ensuring that the behavior of all employees at every level and their daily operations comply with the specified standards.\n\nThe original text discusses the governance framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), highlighting its key components: statutory advisory committees, accountability and transparency, and internal monitoring and external audit. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is inconsistent with the original text. It also uses \"monitoring\" instead of \"controls,\" which is less precise in the context of governance structures.\n**Translation 2** correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"audit\" (singular), but the phrase \"as well as internal monitoring and external audit\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n**Translation 3** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"internal controls and external audits,\" which is more precise. However, \"covers several main components\" is slightly less formal than \"encompasses several key components.\"\n**Translation 4** is very close to the best version, using \"HKMA,\" \"internal controls,\" and \"external audits.\" It is concise and accurate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without the full name \"Hong Kong,\" which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the term. It also uses \"comprises\" instead of \"encompasses,\" which is slightly less common in this context.\n**Translation 6** uses \"internal monitoring\" and \"external auditing,\" which is slightly inconsistent with the more commonly used \"internal controls and external audits\" in governance contexts.\n**Reasoning for improvement:** The best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity, use \"encompasses\" for consistency, and employ \"internal controls and external audits\" as the standard terminology in governance contexts. The structure should be concise and grammatically precise.\nThe HKMA’s governance framework encompasses several key components, including statutory advisory committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audits.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to official terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as part of the HKSAR government.\n- They all capture the key point that the HKMA can hire staff under different terms from civil servants to attract specialized talent.\n- Most translations accurately state that the HKMA’s Chief Executive and staff are public officers.\n- The concept of \"high degree of autonomy\" within statutory powers is generally well conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** Some translations use \"Financial Secretary\" while others use \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" or \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\" The correct term in official contexts is \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" (or \"Financial Management Commissioner\").\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more verbose or awkward in phrasing, such as \"in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge\" (repetition of \"appropriate\" and \"specialized\").\n- **Cultural and Institutional Accuracy:** The term \"Financial Secretary\" is not the correct title for the official who holds the statutory powers in relation to the HKMA. The correct title is \"Commissioner of Financial Management.\"\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"public officials\" instead of \"public officers,\" which is less precise in the context of Hong Kong’s public service terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following should be considered:\n- Use the correct official title: \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" instead of \"Financial Secretary.\"\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, such as using \"public officers\" rather than \"public officials.\"\n- Improve fluency by avoiding repetitive phrasing and ensuring natural English sentence structure.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for official documentation while ensuring clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, but it may employ staff under terms of service different from those of civil servants in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations within the scope of statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Commissioner of Financial Management.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that monetary stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is autonomously responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of the Financial Secretary in maintaining Hong Kong's financial stability and international financial center status, with the assistance of a relevant official, and describes the role of the Financial Management Commissioner in implementing these policies.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the main idea and uses appropriate terminology like \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Secretary for Economic and Fiscal Affairs and Treasury\" is an awkward and incorrect title. The correct title is \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Chief Executive of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau,\" which is closer to the correct title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Chief Executive\" is not the correct title for this role; the correct term is \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\" Also, \"Financial Management Officer\" is not the correct title.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Secretary for the Treasury,\" which is closer to the correct title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Commissioner of Financial Services\" is not the correct title. The correct term is \"Commissioner of the Financial Services and the Treasury\" or \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct title \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Controller\" is not the correct title for the role. The correct term is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the title \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Controller\" is not the correct title for the role. The correct term is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the title \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Commissioner for Financial Management\" is not the standard title used in Hong Kong. The correct term is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct official titles, maintain clarity and fluency, and accurately reflect the original meaning. The correct title for the official assisting the Financial Secretary is \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" and the correct title for the role implementing the policies is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Management Commissioner include:\n\n- Promote the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system;  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;  \n- Handle matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender banknotes and coins;  \n- Promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing, and settlement systems, and where appropriate, be responsible for operating such systems; and  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implement appropriate market development measures to assist in strengthening Hong Kong’s international competitiveness in financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Management Team\n\n# Consultative Committee  \nAdvisory Committee  \nReview and Reasoning:  \nThe original term is “諮詢委員會,” which translates to either “Consultative Committee” or “Advisory Committee” in English. Both are acceptable, but they carry slightly different connotations. “Consultative” emphasizes the role of providing advice through consultation, while “Advisory” focuses more on the function of offering guidance or recommendations. Given the structure of the original text, which includes a hashtag (#), it appears to be a heading or title, likely for an official body or organization. In such contexts, “Advisory Committee” is more commonly used and widely recognized in formal and institutional settings. The repetition of “Advisory Committee” across multiple translations suggests that it is the preferred term in many contexts. However, the use of “Consultative Committee” is also valid and may be preferred in certain specialized or governmental contexts. To ensure clarity, consistency, and alignment with common usage, “Advisory Committee” is the most appropriate and natural choice for this heading.\nAdvisory Committee\n\nThe original sentence, \"諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導,\" translates to \"The advisory committee provides advice and guidance on the main areas of work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with slight variations in terminology and structure.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate core meaning, proper use of terms like \"advisory committee,\" \"consultative committee,\" and \"consultation committee,\" and correct identification of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as the relevant institution. However, there are notable weaknesses:\n1. **Terminology Inconsistency**: The original uses \"諮詢委員會,\" which is best translated as \"Advisory Committee.\" However, some translations use \"Consultative Committee\" or \"Consultation Committee,\" which are less precise and may not align with official terminology used by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n2. **Institutional Name**: The original refers to \"金管局,\" which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could lead to ambiguity, especially in international contexts.\n3. **Verb Choice**: The original uses \"給予意見和指導,\" which is best translated as \"provides advice and guidance.\" Some translations use \"opinions,\" which is slightly less formal and less precise than \"advice.\"\n4. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically correct, but some are more fluent than others. For example, \"The Advisory Committee provides opinions and guidance on the key areas of work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more natural and concise than some alternatives.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the most accurate and official terminology, ensure clarity and fluency, and maintain the formal tone appropriate for an institutional context.\nImproved Translation:  \nThe Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the key areas of work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) as being established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n- They all accurately note that the Financial Secretary is the ex officio chairman.\n- Most translations correctly mention that members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience.\n- The structure of the information is generally preserved, with the mention of the five sub-committees and the reference to pages 53–63.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Financial Management Officer\" instead of \"Commissioner for Financial Management,\" which is not the official title in Hong Kong.\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly refers to \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau Commissioner,\" which is not a recognized title.\n- **Translation 3** misidentifies the \"Chief Secretary for Finance\" instead of \"Financial Secretary,\" and incorrectly lists \"Financial Secretary\" as a member, which is not accurate.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as a member, which is not correct.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly lists \"Financial Secretary\" as a member, which is not accurate.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate in terms of titles and structure, but it uses \"Commissioner for Financial Management\" and \"specialist subcommittees,\" which are slightly less standard than \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"specialized committees.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the correct official titles: \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Commissioner for Financial Management.\"\n- Ensure that the structure is clear and that the roles and responsibilities are accurately conveyed.\n- Use standard terminology such as \"specialized committees\" rather than \"sub-committees\" or \"subcommittees.\"\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, consistent with the nature of the text.\n- Ensure that the reference to the pages is clear and correctly formatted.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to provide advice to the Financial Secretary on matters relating to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Commissioner for Financial Management) are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their personal capacities, under the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees under its jurisdiction, responsible for monitoring the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in specific areas and providing advice, and for reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the advisory committee. For details on the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five specialized committees, please refer to pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Banking Advisory Committee and the Deposit-Taking Companies Advisory Committee provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on matters relating to the Banking Ordinance, particularly concerning the conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business by banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted license banks (as the case may be). Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary and include the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, as well as individuals appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive. For further details regarding the Banking Advisory Committee and the Deposit-Taking Companies Advisory Committee, please refer to pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management Team\n\nThe original text describes the composition and functions of a committee within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 uses \"Presidential Committee\" and \"Chief Executive,\" which may not be the most accurate terms for the HKMA's structure. It is also somewhat repetitive in its use of \"Chief Executive.\"\nTranslation 2 uses \"Executive Committee\" and \"Governor,\" which is more appropriate for the HKMA. However, it incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"Board of Directors\" and \"Monetary Authority,\" which is more accurate. However, it uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which may not be the correct title for the HKMA's head.\nTranslation 4 uses \"Executive Committee\" and \"Chief Executive of the HKMA,\" which is accurate. It also uses \"Chairperson\" instead of \"Chairman,\" which is more modern and appropriate.\nTranslation 5 uses \"Executive Committee\" and \"Governor,\" which is accurate. It also correctly refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and uses \"chairman,\" which is acceptable.\nTranslation 6 uses \"Board of Directors\" and \"Governor,\" which is accurate. However, it uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous.\nBased on this review, the best translation would use \"Executive Committee\" and \"Governor\" as these are the most accurate terms for the HKMA's structure. It should also use \"Chairperson\" instead of \"Chairman\" to reflect modern usage. Additionally, it should clearly refer to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" to avoid ambiguity.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Executive Committee consists of the Governor, Deputy Governors, and other senior officials of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), with the Governor serving as Chairperson. The Executive Committee meets regularly to report to the Governor on the progress of major work undertaken by the HKMA's departments, and to provide advice on policy matters related to the HKMA's operations. For a list of Executive Committee members, please refer to pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) autonomy in its operations and policy implementation, while also highlighting its accountability and transparency. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, fluency, and precision.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"high accountability and transparency.\" It is well-structured and natural in tone.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is incorrect—the correct body is the HKMA. This is a critical error in terminology.\n**Translation 3** is grammatically correct but slightly wordy, with \"been supported by high accountability and transparency\" being less direct than other versions.\n**Translation 4** is concise and uses \"coupled with strong accountability and transparency,\" which is a natural phrasing. However, it uses \"HKMA\" without spelling it out first, which may be less formal.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"a high level of accountability and transparency\" instead of \"high accountability and transparency.\" Both are acceptable, but \"a high level of\" is slightly more formal.\n**Translation 6** is also accurate and concise, using \"accompanied by strong accountability and transparency,\" which is a natural and idiomatic expression.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention, followed by \"HKMA\" in subsequent references.\n- Maintain consistency in phrasing, such as using \"high accountability and transparency\" or \"strong accountability and transparency.\"\n- Ensure the sentence flows smoothly and avoids redundancy.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods used to implement government policy objectives, while also ensuring strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe original text outlines the accountability structure of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), emphasizing its dual accountability to the Financial Secretary and the Legislative Council, as well as its broader responsibilities in promoting transparency and public engagement. The translations provided by junior translators capture the general meaning but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with a clear structure. However, it uses \"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" which is incorrect; the correct title is \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n- **Translation 2** correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and uses \"Financial Secretary\" appropriately. However, \"maintaining extensive contact with society\" is slightly less formal than \"engagement with society.\"\n- **Translation 3** misidentifies the role as \"Chief Executive Officer\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" which is a critical error.\n- **Translation 4** is accurate and uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" correctly. It also uses \"uphold an open policy,\" which is slightly less idiomatic than \"maintain openness.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Financial Management Specialist\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"matters of concern to the community,\" which is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly states that the HKMA is \"appointed by the Financial Secretary,\" which is not accurate; the Financial Management Commissioner is appointed, not the HKMA itself.\n**Improvements:**\n- Correct the title of the role to \"Financial Management Commissioner.\"\n- Use \"engagement with society\" or \"contact with the community\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Ensure that the HKMA is not incorrectly described as being \"appointed\" by the Financial Secretary.\n- Use idiomatic expressions such as \"maintain openness\" or \"uphold an open policy\" depending on the desired tone.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"public concern\" or \"matters of concern to the community.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibilities, including promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA remains committed to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:\n\n- The translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are variations in fluency, structure, and precision that can be refined.\n- **Strengths**: All translations correctly identify the key elements: the need to inform the public and financial sector about the HKMA's work while respecting legal and confidentiality constraints, and the importance of the HKMA being responsive to public opinion. The use of terms like \"market sensitivity,\" \"commercial secrets,\" and \"confidential information\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Weaknesses**: Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing or structure. For example, \"to the fullest extent possible without contravening legal restrictions\" (Translation 2) is grammatically correct but somewhat wordy. Others, like \"strive to ensure\" (Translation 3), may be less direct than \"strive to ensure\" or \"ensure to the extent possible.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar**: Translation 1 and 5 are the most fluent and grammatically sound. They use parallel structure effectively and maintain a professional tone. Translation 4 is also strong, though slightly more wordy in the first clause.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard terminology related to financial regulation and public communication.\n- **Improvements**: A more concise and natural phrasing could be achieved by using \"taking into account\" or \"while respecting\" to introduce the legal and confidentiality constraints. The phrase \"stays attuned to public sentiment\" is more natural than \"remains attuned to the pulse of the community\" or \"understands public sentiment.\"\n- **Best Possible Translation**: A refined version would balance clarity, conciseness, and natural English phrasing while preserving the original intent and structure.\n- Final Translation:\n- To the extent possible, ensure the financial sector and the public are fully informed of the HKMA's work, taking into account legal restrictions related to market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and the disclosure of confidential information; and  \n- Ensure the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\n# Communicating with the Public\n\nThe original text outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) key functions and objectives, emphasizing stability, reserve management, financial infrastructure development, and economic promotion. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect the overall tone and precision.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and uses \"monitoring\" which is appropriate for the context of overseeing financial infrastructure. However, \"monitoring\" may be slightly less precise than \"supervising\" or \"overseeing\" in the context of regulatory functions.\nTranslation 2 is very similar to Translation 1, but uses \"supervising\" instead of \"monitoring.\" This is a more precise term in the context of financial regulation and oversight.\nTranslation 3 uses \"maintaining\" instead of \"promoting\" for the stability of the monetary and banking systems. While \"maintaining\" is correct, \"promoting\" better reflects the proactive role of the HKMA in ensuring stability.\nTranslation 4 uses \"driving\" instead of \"promoting\" for economic development, which is a stronger and more dynamic verb. It also uses \"status\" instead of \"position\" for \"position as an international financial center,\" which is slightly more formal and appropriate in this context.\nTranslation 5 uses \"currency and banking system\" instead of \"monetary and banking systems.\" While this is not incorrect, \"monetary and banking systems\" is more standard in financial terminology.\nTranslation 6 uses \"overseeing\" instead of \"supervising\" or \"monitoring,\" which is also appropriate. It also uses \"driving\" for economic development, which is a strong and active verb. However, it uses \"system\" instead of \"systems\" for \"monetary and banking system,\" which is slightly less precise.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"promoting\" for the stability of the monetary and banking systems, \"supervising\" or \"overseeing\" for the financial infrastructure, \"status\" for the international financial center, and \"driving\" for economic development. It should also use the plural \"systems\" for consistency with financial terminology.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center and driving Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must earn the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and operations to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive contact with the media and utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA also makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its scope of responsibilities, particularly by promptly clarifying false information and rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media channels.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) office houses an information center, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. Details regarding the HKMA's work in communication and liaison with the public can be found in the chapter on \"Institutional Functions\" (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe original text discusses the importance of the relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council (LegCo) in promoting accountability and transparency. It also outlines the HKMA Governor's commitment to providing regular briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council and the availability of these briefings on the HKMA website.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, but it uses \"the Authority's各项工作\" which is awkward in English. It should be \"the Authority's various operations\" or \"the Authority's various work.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently, and the sentence structure is natural. However, \"various operations and policies\" is slightly more formal than \"operations and policies\" alone, which may be unnecessary.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"vital\" instead of \"crucial,\" which is a minor stylistic choice. The use of \"answering related inquiries\" is natural and concise.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very strong. It uses \"LegCo\" as an abbreviation, which is appropriate in formal contexts. The phrase \"three briefings annually\" is more concise than \"three times a year.\" The use of \"available on the HKMA's website\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation has a significant error: it refers to the \"House Committee on Financial Affairs\" instead of the \"Financial Affairs Committee.\" This is a critical mistake, as it misrepresents the actual committee. It also uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which is incorrect in this context.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Finance Committee\" instead of \"Financial Affairs Committee,\" which is a minor discrepancy. It also uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which may be a point of contention depending on the official title used by the HKMA.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct terminology. It should use \"Governor\" for the head of the HKMA, as this is the official title. It should also use \"Financial Affairs Committee\" as the correct name of the committee. The use of \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation is appropriate in formal contexts. The phrase \"three briefings annually\" is more concise than \"three times a year.\" The phrase \"available on the HKMA's website\" is natural and commonly used.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to providing three briefings annually to the Legislative Council’s Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA’s operations and policies, and to answering related inquiries. The Governor’s regular briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee are available on the HKMA’s website.\n\nIn addition, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority occasionally attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Standing Committee and Sub-committees to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information Disclosure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality and naturalness of the English translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its commitment to transparency.\n- The use of \"bilingual\" to describe the website and publications is consistent across translations.\n- The inclusion of the website URL and the list of content types (economic research, statistical data, etc.) is accurate in all versions.\n- The translations effectively convey that the website contains a variety of materials, including publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"achieving the highest international standards in transparency,\" while others use \"international best practices in transparency.\" While both are acceptable, \"best practices\" may be more commonly used in professional contexts.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"issued by the HKMA\" or \"the HKMA’s bilingual website.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"features dedicated sections listing economic research\" or \"hosts numerous publications,\" which can be improved for smoother readability.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"journals\" while others use \"periodicals\" or \"publications,\" which may cause slight confusion in terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent and natural terminology, such as \"publications\" or \"special publications\" rather than mixing \"journals\" and \"periodicals.\"\n- Opt for \"international best practices\" as a more commonly used phrase in professional and regulatory contexts.\n- Ensure smooth and concise sentence structure, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain a formal yet fluent tone appropriate for an official organization like the HKMA.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation should be concise, natural, and consistent in terminology and tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving international best practices in transparency and publishes a variety of bilingual publications and special reports. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections covering economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a large collection of publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and institutional names. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent, with correct use of terms like \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" and \"Note Issuing Office.\" However, \"Note Issuing Office\" is not the standard term used in English for the institution; the correct term is \"Currency Issuing Office\" or \"Hong Kong Note Issuing Office.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with the addition of \"IMF\" and \"SDDS\" in parentheses, which improves clarity. It also uses \"Monetary Issuing Committee\" and \"Hong Kong Note Issuing Office,\" which are more accurate than \"Note Issuing Office.\" This is a strong translation.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version uses \"Currency Issuance Department\" and \"Currency Issuance Committee,\" which are not standard terms. It also uses \"Data Publication Standards\" instead of the correct \"Special Data Dissemination Standard.\" The translation is less accurate in terms of terminology.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation incorrectly refers to \"the Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office\" and \"Monetary Policy Committee\" instead of \"Currency Issuing Committee.\" These are significant errors in terminology and should be corrected.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version uses \"currency board\" instead of \"Note Issuing Office\" and \"Currency Board Committee\" instead of \"Currency Issuing Committee.\" These are incorrect terms and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the structure of the HKMA.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most detailed, mentioning the \"Annual Report on the operation of the Currency Board.\" However, it uses \"Currency Board\" instead of \"Note Issuing Office\" and \"Currency Board Committee\" instead of \"Currency Issuing Committee.\" It also uses \"Transparency Initiative – Special Data Dissemination Standard,\" which is not the standard name of the program.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the correct institutional names, such as \"Hong Kong Note Issuing Office\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" It should also use the correct program name: \"Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)\" of the IMF. The term \"Currency Issuing Committee\" is more accurate than \"Monetary Issuing Committee\" or \"Currency Board Committee.\" Additionally, the translation should be fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal or awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regularly reviews whether the disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office's accounts is sufficient. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuing Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\n# Internal Monitoring and External Audit\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 內部監控與外部審計,\" which translates to \"Internal Monitoring and External Audit.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, with the primary difference being the use of \"Controls\" versus \"Monitoring\" and the singular versus plural form of \"Audit.\"\nThe first translation, \"Internal Controls and External Audits,\" uses the singular \"Audit\" for the second term, which is grammatically inconsistent with the plural \"Controls.\" Additionally, \"Controls\" may not be the most accurate term in this context, as \"Monitoring\" more closely aligns with the Chinese term \"監控.\"\nThe second translation, \"Internal Control and External Audit,\" uses the singular form for both terms, which is grammatically consistent but may not fully capture the breadth of the original Chinese term \"監控,\" which implies a broader scope of oversight and surveillance.\nThe third through sixth translations all use \"Internal Monitoring and External Audit,\" which is grammatically correct and more accurately reflects the meaning of the original Chinese text. However, the use of \"Audit\" in the singular form may not be the most appropriate, as \"Audits\" in the plural form is more commonly used in professional and business contexts to refer to the process of reviewing financial records and operations.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Internal Monitoring and External Audits,\" which accurately reflects the original Chinese text, uses the correct grammatical form, and is consistent with professional terminology.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) use of monitoring mechanisms to ensure integrity, risk management, and checks and balances, as well as the role of internal and external audits in evaluating these mechanisms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** Uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. The term \"monitoring mechanisms\" is repeated, which is slightly redundant. The translation is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"employee conduct\" instead of \"integrity,\" which is slightly more natural in this context. The phrase \"whether the monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and effective\" is slightly wordy but still clear.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"staff integrity,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"both internal and external audit functions\" is slightly more natural than \"internal and external audit functions.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less precise. The phrase \"sound and effective\" is slightly less common than \"robust and effective.\" The use of \"assessments on whether\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"employee conduct.\" The phrase \"monitoring mechanism\" is singular, which is inconsistent with the original text. The use of \"whether the monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and effective\" is slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"adherence to high standards of employee conduct,\" which is a more precise and natural phrasing. The use of \"assessments on whether\" is slightly awkward but not incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for the authority (\"HKMA\"), maintain the plural form of \"monitoring mechanisms\" to match the original, and use natural phrasing such as \"employee conduct\" or \"employee integrity.\" The phrase \"provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms\" is concise and accurate. The use of \"ensure adherence to high standards\" is more precise than \"ensure high standards.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts robust and effective monitoring mechanisms to ensure adherence to high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe original Chinese sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing the role of the Code of Conduct in guiding employees' ethical and legal behavior across all levels of the organization. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, word choice, and fluency that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (\"The Code of Conduct\") and its purpose (\"provides guidance on...\").\n- The use of \"ethical and legal responsibilities\" is consistent and accurate.\n- The phrase \"ensuring that the behavior of all employees...\" is well-conveyed in all versions, with slight variations in prepositions and word choice.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"employees at all levels,\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"all levels of staff\" or \"all staff at every level.\"\n- The third translation uses \"all levels of staff,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in flow.\n- The fourth translation uses \"at every level,\" which is more natural than \"at all levels\" in formal writing.\n- The fifth and sixth translations use \"conduct\" and \"conforms to established standards,\" which are more formal and precise than \"behavior\" and \"meets specified standards.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should aim for clarity, fluency, and formality, while maintaining the original intent. \"Conduct\" is a more formal and precise term than \"behavior\" in this context. \"Conforms to established standards\" is more natural and commonly used in formal documents than \"meets specified standards.\" Additionally, \"all staff at every level\" is more concise and natural than \"all employees at all levels\" or \"all levels of staff.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees’ ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all staff at every level conforms to established standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 內部監控,\" which translates to \"Internal Monitoring\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured the literal translation, but there are a few nuances to consider.\nTranslation 1: \"Internal monitoring\" is correct but lacks the hashtag, which may be important for formatting or categorization purposes.\nTranslation 2: \"Internal Monitoring\" is the most accurate and natural translation, with proper capitalization and without unnecessary punctuation.\nTranslation 3: \"# Internal Monitoring\" is the same as the original, including the hashtag, which may be appropriate depending on the context.\nTranslation 4: \"Internal Controls\" is a related term but not an exact translation. \"Controls\" implies a system of checks and balances, which may not be the intended meaning of \"監控\" (monitoring).\nTranslation 5 and 6: Both are identical to Translation 3, including the hashtag.\nConsidering the context and the need for accuracy, \"Internal Monitoring\" is the most appropriate translation. It is concise, natural, and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text. If the hashtag is necessary for formatting or categorization, it can be included as \"# Internal Monitoring.\" However, if the hashtag is not required, \"Internal Monitoring\" alone is sufficient.\n\n# Operational Monitoring\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 運作監控,\" which translates to \"Operational Monitoring\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with the most common being \"Operation Monitoring\" and \"Operational Monitoring.\" \n\"Operational Monitoring\" is the more accurate and commonly used term in professional and technical contexts. It conveys the idea of monitoring operations or processes, which is the intended meaning of \"運作監控.\" The term \"Operation Monitoring\" is grammatically correct but less idiomatic and less commonly used in formal or technical English. \nThe use of the hashtag symbol (#) in the translations is consistent with the original text, which includes it. However, in English, the use of a hashtag before a title is not standard unless it is part of a specific format or platform requirement. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to omit the hashtag unless it is necessary for the context in which the translation will be used.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation of \"# 運作監控\" into English is \"Operational Monitoring.\" This translation is accurate, idiomatic, and appropriate for professional and technical contexts.\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for identifying and assessing risks within their workflows and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the stable and smooth daily operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the responsibilities of the Risk Committee, emphasizing its role in reviewing and reporting on risks and related risk management measures. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but it uses \"the adequacy of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies\" which is slightly less direct than the original. It also uses \"determines\" which is appropriate but slightly less formal than \"establishes\" or \"sets.\"\n**Translation 2** and **Translation 3** are identical and use \"whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate,\" which is more direct and grammatically precise than using \"the adequacy of.\" This structure better reflects the original Chinese, which uses a structure that implies an evaluation of adequacy.\n**Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 2, but it uses \"relevant\" instead of \"related,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation. It is also grammatically sound and fluent.\n**Translation 5** uses \"establishes\" instead of \"determines\" for \"follow-up actions,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still acceptable. However, \"establishes\" may imply a more formal or institutional setting, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context.\n**Translation 6** misinterprets the original sentence by stating that the Risk Committee reviews the \"adequacy of potential and emerging risks,\" which is incorrect. The original sentence is about reviewing the adequacy of the monitoring and mitigation strategies, not the risks themselves. This is a significant error in meaning and should be corrected.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, accurately reflect the evaluation of monitoring and mitigation strategies, and use natural English phrasing. The use of \"whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate\" is more direct and grammatically precise. \"Determines appropriate follow-up actions\" is also appropriate, though \"establishes\" could be used for a slightly more formal tone.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 內部審計,\" which translates directly to \"# Internal Audit.\" The junior translators have all provided translations that are technically correct, as \"Internal Audit\" is the standard and widely accepted term in English for \"內部審計.\" However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Use of the Hash Symbol (#):** The original text includes a hash symbol before the heading. While this is common in markdown or digital formatting, it is not typically used in formal English documents. The first and sixth junior translators retained the hash symbol, while the others did not. This could be a stylistic choice depending on the context in which the heading is used.\n2. **Consistency and Formatting:** The translations are consistent in terms of terminology, which is a strength. However, the inclusion or exclusion of the hash symbol may affect the formatting depending on the document's style guide.\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness:** \"Internal Audit\" is a standard term in English business and accounting contexts, so the translations are culturally appropriate.\n**Improved Translation:** Based on the above considerations, the best translation would be \"Internal Audit\" without the hash symbol, assuming the heading is intended for a formal or professional document. If the hash symbol is required for formatting purposes, it can be retained as \"# Internal Audit.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement describing the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Internal Audit Department. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, structure, and fluency that can be refined.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. Also, \"governance processes\" is slightly less precise than \"governance procedures.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Audit Division.\" However, \"assesses whether\" is slightly less direct than \"assesses the sufficiency and effectiveness of.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Internal Audit Department\" and \"governance procedures,\" which is accurate. However, \"makes recommendations for improvement\" is slightly less formal than \"provides recommendations for improvement.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"determine whether they are sufficient and effective,\" which is more natural than \"assesses whether... are adequate and effective.\" Also, \"provides recommendations for improvement\" is well phrased.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"sufficiency and effectiveness\" as a noun phrase, which is more concise and formal. However, \"provides improvement recommendations\" is slightly less common than \"provides recommendations for improvement.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error.

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的資產質素\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2024年第4季為178.4%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為67.0%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2024年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為143.4%及186.7%（圖14）。以上所有四個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖 13 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 14 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports amid improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle. The labor market remained resilient, and inflation stayed moderate as external price pressures continued to ease. The local stock market experienced a significant recovery, while the property market remained largely weak due to subdued market sentiment in the sustained high-interest rate environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, the mainland's proactive implementation of economic stimulus measures, combined with multifaceted support for local businesses, should help bolster business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international engagement and cooperation, as well as deepen regional collaboration.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy experienced moderate growth in 2024. Real local GDP rose by 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, following a 3.2% increase in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Externally, goods exports returned to positive growth, driven by improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle, becoming a major driver of overall economic growth. Service exports also continued to grow, supported by the sustained recovery of inbound tourism and a significant increase in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, the significant rise in service imports, driven by continued growth in outbound tourism, offset the positive impact of service exports on overall economic growth. Domestically, private consumption expenditure softened due to changes in consumption patterns among local residents. In contrast, an increase in property transactions and an improved business climate, as monetary conditions gradually eased, drove a mild increase in overall investment expenditure.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\nThe original Chinese text is a straightforward title and source citation for a figure. The goal is to produce a clear, accurate, and natural English translation that maintains the formal tone appropriate for statistical or governmental documentation.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and concise. \"Real local GDP\" is a direct and appropriate translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Growth of real local GDP\" is slightly less natural than \"Real Local GDP Growth\" in title form.  \n   - **Source:** Correctly uses \"Government Statistics Department.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Real GDP Growth by Component,\" which is a common phrasing in economic reports.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Census and Statistics Department\" is not the standard name for the department in most contexts; \"Government Statistics Department\" is more commonly used.  \n   - **Fluency:** Good, but the source name is slightly off.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Real Gross Domestic Product Growth,\" which is fully correct and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Government Statistics Office\" is not the standard name for the department in most jurisdictions; \"Department\" is more common than \"Office.\"  \n   - **Fluency:** Good, but the source name is slightly inaccurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the third, but with \"Department\" instead of \"Office,\" which is more accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy with \"Gross Domestic Product\" instead of the more concise \"GDP.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Real Local GDP Growth,\" which is concise and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. The source is correctly named.  \n   - **Fluency:** Excellent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Attempts to translate the entire phrase, but the structure is awkward and unnatural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"Contribution of the components of Figure 1\" is ungrammatical and confusing. Also, \"生产总值\" is left in Chinese, which is a major error.  \n   - **Fluency:** Poor.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use standard terminology. \"Real Local GDP Growth\" is more natural and commonly used in economic contexts than \"Real Gross Domestic Product Growth.\" Additionally, \"Government Statistics Department\" is the most accurate and standard name for the source in most governmental contexts. The title should be structured as a noun phrase, not a full sentence, to match the formal style of statistical reports.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: The quarter-on-quarter changes in seasonally adjusted local fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nAlthough the original text is relatively straightforward, the junior translators have produced translations with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of their work:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"underlying\" for \"基本\" which is appropriate in economic contexts. The structure is clear and the sentence flow is natural. However, \"newly signed private residential rents\" could be slightly more natural as \"newly signed private residential rental prices\" or \"newly signed private residential leases.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate but uses \"mild\" instead of \"moderate,\" which is slightly less precise in economic terminology. The phrase \"is expected to remain mild\" introduces a speculative tone that is not present in the original. The use of \"projected to be\" also adds an unnecessary forecast element.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but it uses \"core\" instead of \"basic\" or \"underlying,\" which may not be the best term in this context. \"Core inflation\" is a standard term, but the original uses \"基本\" which is more accurately translated as \"underlying\" or \"basic.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is more specific by mentioning \"Hong Kong\" explicitly, which may be appropriate depending on the context. However, the original text does not specify the location, so this addition may be an assumption. The phrase \"cost pressures within Hong Kong\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"core\" for \"基本,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term in this context. The structure is clear and the sentence flow is natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in meaning and uses \"core\" for \"基本,\" which is acceptable. However, the phrase \"leading to moderate inflation\" is slightly more causal than the original, which is more descriptive.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should maintain the original's descriptive tone, use precise economic terminology, and avoid unnecessary speculation or assumptions. \"Underlying inflation\" is more standard than \"core\" in this context, and the phrase \"remained largely under control\" is more accurate than \"remain broadly contained\" or \"remain mild.\" Also, the original does not specify a location, so adding \"Hong Kong\" should be avoided unless contextually necessary.\n**Improved translation**:\nDespite the gradual increase in newly signed private residential rental prices, local cost pressures remained largely under control, and external price pressures gradually eased, keeping local inflation moderate in 2024 (Figure 2). For the full year of 2024, the underlying and overall inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text accurately, with only minor differences in wording and phrasing. However, there are notable variations in fluency, vocabulary choice, and cultural appropriateness that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points, such as the unemployment rate range, the trend in employment numbers, and the government's announcement regarding the talent attraction program.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"labor market,\" \"unemployment rate,\" \"nominal wages,\" and \"talent attraction program\" is appropriate and aligns with standard economic terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use repetitive phrasing, such as \"gradually increased\" and \"recorded steady increases,\" which can be made more varied for better readability.\n- The phrase \"inject new momentum into the local population\" appears in multiple translations, but \"inject new vitality\" or \"inject new impetus\" are more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The term \"manpower shortages\" is used in some translations, but \"labor shortages\" is more standard in English economic discourse.\n- The use of \"fluctuating between\" in the first translation is slightly less precise than \"hovering between\" or \"remaining within a range of.\"\n- The phrase \"incorporating more young people\" is less natural than \"attracting more young people\" or \"bringing in more young people.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more varied and precise vocabulary to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, such as using \"labor shortages\" instead of \"manpower shortages.\"\n- Refine phrasing for fluency and naturalness, particularly in expressions like \"inject new vitality\" and \"attracting more young people.\"\n- Ensure that the tone remains formal and professional, as befits a government policy document or economic report.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would integrate the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations while refining the language for clarity, precision, and natural flow.\nThe labor market remained robust in 2024, with the unemployment rate fluctuating within a low range of 2.9% to 3.1% throughout the year (Figure 3). Starting from the first quarter, total employment (Figure 3) gradually increased, alongside a rise in the labor force, reflecting a generally stable balance between labor demand and supply. Meanwhile, as the economy continued to grow, both nominal wages and labor income recorded solid increases. Additionally, the government announced in the 2024 Policy Address further enhancements to Hong Kong’s talent attraction program to alleviate labor shortages across various industries and to inject new vitality into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Government Statistics Department  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, consisting of two parts: the title of the figure (\"圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\") and the source (\"資料來源：政府統計處\"). The junior translators have produced several variations, with differences in terminology and formatting.\nThe term \"基本消費物價通脹\" is most accurately translated as \"Core Consumer Price Inflation\" rather than \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation.\" In economic terminology, \"core\" refers to inflation excluding volatile items like food and energy, which is the standard usage in English-speaking contexts. \"Basic\" is less precise and may be misunderstood as referring to fundamental or essential inflation, which is not the intended meaning here.\nThe source \"政府統計處\" is correctly translated as \"Government Statistics Department\" in most translations. However, the fourth junior translator used \"Government Statistics Office,\" which is less common and may not be the official name of the department in English. The term \"Census and Statistics Department\" is also used in some translations, but this appears to be a direct translation of the Chinese name and may not reflect the official English name used by the organization itself.\nIn terms of formatting, the first, third, and fourth translations use \"Figure 2: [Title]\" with a colon, which is standard. The fifth and sixth translations omit the colon and use \"Figure 2 [Title]\" without punctuation, which is less conventional. Additionally, the fifth translation includes \"Data Source:\" instead of \"Source:\", which is redundant and less concise.\nConsidering these points, the best translation should use \"Core Consumer Price Inflation\" as the title, \"Source: Government Statistics Department\" as the source, and follow standard formatting with a colon after \"Figure 2.\" This ensures clarity, accuracy, and adherence to common English conventions in academic and statistical reporting.\n\nFigure 3 Labor Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple caption for a figure, consisting of two parts: the title (\"圖 3 勞工市場狀況\") and the source (\"資料來源：政府統計處\"). The junior translators have mostly captured the meaning accurately, but there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and consistency.\n- **Strengths:** All translations correctly identify \"Figure 3\" and the general idea of \"labor market\" or \"labor market conditions.\" The term \"Government Statistics Department\" is used consistently across most translations, which is appropriate for the source.\n- **Weaknesses:** \n  - The third translator used \"Census and Statistics Department,\" which may not be the exact name of the department in the context of the original text. This could be a misinterpretation of \"政府統計處.\"\n  - The fourth and fifth translators used \"Labor Market Situation\" and \"Labor Market Conditions,\" respectively. While both are acceptable, \"conditions\" is more commonly used in formal reports to describe the state of a market.\n  - Punctuation and spacing also vary. For example, the fourth translation uses a period after \"Situation,\" which is unnecessary in a figure caption. The fifth translation lacks a space between \"Conditions\" and \"Source,\" which affects readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Labor Market Conditions\" as it is more standard in formal contexts.\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Government Statistics Department\" as the source.\n- Maintain proper punctuation and spacing for clarity and professionalism.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market saw a significant turnaround in 2024 following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, improved market sentiment, driven by the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts and proactive economic stimulus measures introduced by the Mainland, propelled the Hang Seng Index to a year-high of 23,100 points on October 7th (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November triggered market concerns regarding the global economic outlook and the pace of the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing, leading to a slight correction in the Hong Kong stock market. Nevertheless, the Hang Seng Index closed the year at 20,060 points, a significant increase of 17.7% compared to the end of 2023, ending a four-year consecutive decline.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points, such as the 23.5% increase in residential transactions, the 7.1% year-on-year price decline, and the challenges faced by the non-residential market.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"downward pressure,\" \"affordability,\" and \"vacancy rates\" is appropriate and commonly used in real estate contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and consistency:** Some translations use \"remained weak\" while others use \"was generally sluggish.\" A more consistent tense and phrasing would enhance readability.\n- **\"Supported by\" vs. \"Supported by the easing of\":** Some translations use \"supported by policy easing\" while others use \"supported by the easing of related policy measures.\" The latter is more precise and grammatically complete.\n- **\"Residential property market\" vs. \"residential property market\":** While not a major issue, consistency in phrasing (e.g., using \"residential property market\" consistently) improves clarity.\n- **\"Purchasing affordability\" vs. \"housing affordability\":** \"Housing affordability\" is more standard and widely used in real estate discussions.\n- **\"Consumer behavior\" vs. \"consumption patterns\":** Both are acceptable, but \"consumer behavior\" is more natural in this context.\n- **\"Retail shops\" vs. \"retail properties\":** \"Retail properties\" is more precise and aligns better with the formal tone of the text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of terms like \"residential property market\" and \"non-residential property market.\"\n- Use \"housing affordability\" instead of \"purchasing affordability\" for clarity and standard usage.\n- Use \"consumer behavior\" instead of \"consumption patterns\" for natural phrasing.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"supported by\" is followed by a complete clause, such as \"supported by the easing of related policy measures.\"\n- Maintain a consistent tense and phrasing throughout the translation for fluency.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe residential property market remained generally weak during the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. Supported by the easing of related policy measures in late February and mid-October, as well as the interest rate cut cycle that began in September, the annual residential transaction volume rose significantly by 23.5% from the historical low of 43,002 units in 2023 to 53,099 units in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage rates and accumulated inventory in the new housing market continued to exert downward pressure on property prices. As a result, property prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, leading to a slight improvement in housing affordability, although it remained relatively tight. The non-residential property market continued to be weak. Office vacancy rates remained high despite ample supply, while retail properties faced challenges stemming from shifts in consumer behavior among both tourists and local residents.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nGiven the original Chinese text, the six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and structure. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate. The use of \"multifaceted support\" and \"cutting-edge technologies\" is appropriate. However, \"should enhance the resilience of local businesses\" is slightly less direct than \"should enhance local businesses' resilience.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the only notable difference being the use of \"implementation of economic stimulus measures\" instead of \"economic stimulus measures.\" The phrase \"accelerate connections with emerging markets\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"accelerate engagement with emerging markets.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and natural. The use of \"cutting-edge technology sectors\" is slightly more specific than necessary, but still acceptable. The phrase \"visitor numbers to Hong Kong are expected to grow further\" is slightly more literal than the more natural \"tourism is expected to experience further growth.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best translations. The use of \"comprehensive support\" and \"frontier technology sectors\" is slightly more formal but still appropriate. The phrase \"the tourism sector is expected to experience further growth\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. The use of \"Against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions\" is more idiomatic and natural than \"Given the escalating trade tensions.\" The phrase \"China's proactive implementation\" is slightly less precise than \"Mainland China's proactive implementation.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and natural. The phrase \"with continued support from relevant authorities and the banking sector in various aspects\" is slightly wordy compared to \"continued and multifaceted support from relevant authorities and the banking sector.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best translation should be natural, fluent, and idiomatic in English, while accurately reflecting the meaning and nuance of the original Chinese. It should avoid overly formal or literal phrasing, and should use common expressions that are appropriate for the context.\n**Improved translation**:\nAgainst the backdrop of escalating trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and capital flows, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, continued and multifaceted support from relevant authorities and the banking sector should enhance local businesses' resilience. Mainland China's proactive implementation of economic stimulus measures and significant breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies are also expected to boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and accelerate engagement with emerging markets. Meanwhile, under the mainland authorities' favorable tourism policies toward Hong Kong and the government's efforts to revitalize the tourism industry, the tourism sector is expected to experience further growth.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. As rising housing rents gradually pass through to consumer prices, local costs may face mild upward pressure. However, despite increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook, external price pressures should remain moderate. On the other hand, the labor market may face challenges due to escalating trade tensions. Nevertheless, various talent attraction programs should help continue building a high-quality talent pool, supporting the long-term development of the economy.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text, which is that the Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2024 despite macroeconomic challenges, with increased credit risk but manageable asset quality and rising retail bank profits due to investment and fee income. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations use accurate terminology related to banking, such as \"capital,\" \"liquidity,\" \"credit risk,\" and \"asset quality.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of terms like \"resilient\" or \"stable\" effectively captures the intended meaning of the original Chinese term \"穩健.\"\n- Most translations correctly identify the source of profit growth as increased investment gains and fee\/commission income.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"being very ample\" (Translation 2) or \"remained under control\" (Translation 6), which are less idiomatic than alternatives like \"remained manageable.\"\n- The phrase \"investment gains from trading holdings\" (Translation 2) is slightly unclear and could be more precise.\n- \"Retail banking profits grew compared to 2023\" (Translation 3) is grammatically correct but less dynamic than \"retail bank profits increased compared to 2023.\"\n- Some translations use \"banking system\" while others use \"banking sector\" or \"banking industry,\" which are all acceptable but not consistently applied across translations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more idiomatic expressions such as \"remained resilient\" or \"remained stable\" depending on the nuance of the original.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, such as using \"banking system\" or \"banking sector\" consistently.\n- Use more precise and natural phrasing, such as \"investment income from trading activities\" instead of \"investment gains from trading holdings.\"\n- Ensure that the causal relationship between the factors (e.g., increased investment income and fee income) and the outcome (profit growth) is clearly and smoothly expressed.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2024, with banks maintaining ample capital and liquidity. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risk faced by the banking system increased during the year, although the overall quality of bank assets remained manageable. Retail bank profits increased compared to 2023, benefiting from higher investment income from trading activities and increased fee and commission income.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, precision, and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the numerical data and the overall message of the original text.\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of information.\n- The use of terms such as \"specific classification loan ratio,\" \"overdue and restructured loan ratio,\" and \"credit provision coverage ratio\" is largely consistent across translations, which is important for maintaining technical accuracy.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the ratio of overdue and restructured loans\" instead of \"the overdue and restructured loan ratio,\" which is more concise and natural.\n- The phrase \"the ratio of credit provisions and specific classification loan ratio\" is grammatically incorrect and should be \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratios.\"\n- Some translations use \"liquidation value\" or \"realizable value\" interchangeably, but \"realizable value\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained at low levels\" is slightly repetitive and could be more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural and concise phrasing, such as \"the overdue and restructured loan ratio\" instead of \"the ratio of overdue and restructured loans.\"\n- Correct the grammatical structure when referring to ratios, such as \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratios.\"\n- Use \"realizable value\" consistently for clarity and precision.\n- Simplify and streamline sentences where possible to enhance readability.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would incorporate the most accurate and natural phrasing, ensuring clarity, precision, and fluency in English.\nThe banking system's specific classification loan ratio increased from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio rose from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). This increase in the specific classification loan ratio was primarily due to downgrades in the credit ratings of some mainland Chinese real estate developers, as well as local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the specific classification loan ratio for related loans in mainland China decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024. Bank provisions remained adequate. As of the end of 2024, the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratios) was approximately 65%. After deducting the realizable value of collateral from the non-performing loan balance, the adjusted credit provision coverage ratio was approximately 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained at low levels, at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nThe original Chinese text is concise and straightforward, with two key components: the title of the figure (\"圖 5 銀行體系的資產質素\") and the source of the data (\"資料來源：金管局\").\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"Banking System\" is appropriate, and the full name of the source is provided with the acronym in parentheses. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Second junior translator**: The title is slightly less natural (\"Quality of Assets in the Banking System\" vs. \"Asset Quality of the Banking System\"). The source is correctly identified but lacks the acronym (HKMA), which is commonly used in financial contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"Banking Sector\" is slightly less precise than \"Banking System,\" which is the more commonly used term in financial reporting. The source is abbreviated as \"HKMA\" with the full name in parentheses, which is good.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The title is grammatically correct but less idiomatic (\"Quality of Banking System Assets\" is a bit awkward compared to \"Asset Quality of the Banking System\"). The source is abbreviated as \"Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect and lacks specificity.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: The title is accurate and natural. The source is correctly identified with the full name, but the lack of the acronym (HKMA) is a minor omission.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: The title is accurate, but the source is incorrectly translated as \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This is a significant error.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, natural, and culturally appropriate. It should use the standard terminology found in financial reports and include both the full name and the commonly used acronym for the source. \"Banking System\" is the preferred term over \"Banking Sector\" or \"Banking Assets\" in this context. The source should be clearly identified as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as this is the official name and acronym used in financial and regulatory contexts.\nBased on this reasoning, the most accurate and natural translation is:\n**Figure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nRetail banking's overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the average return on assets after tax rose from 0.88% to 0.93% (Figure 7). The profit growth was primarily driven by gains from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and an increase in fee and commission income (+15.4%), although this increase was partially offset by a decline in net interest income (–5.2%). The net interest margin for retail banking narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). Meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banking rose slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 資產負債表走勢,\" which translates to \"Balance Sheet Trends\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured the correct translation, but there are minor inconsistencies in formatting and singular\/plural usage.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations correctly use the plural form \"Trends,\" which is appropriate for describing the movement or development of a balance sheet over time. The third and fifth translations use the singular \"Trend,\" which is less accurate in this context, as the term \"走勢\" implies a general direction or pattern, not a single trend.\nThe second and fifth translations also include the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original text. However, in English, the use of \"#\" before a heading is not standard unless it's part of a specific formatting convention (e.g., in markdown or social media). Therefore, including the \"#\" may not be necessary unless the context requires it.\nThe best translation would be \"Balance Sheet Trends,\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most natural and standard English equivalent of the original Chinese text. It is grammatically correct, fluent, and culturally appropriate.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key figures and percentages, such as the 4.3% expansion of the banking system's balance sheet and the 13.4% increase in transferable\/negotiable debt instruments.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"transferable debt instruments\" and \"trade financing\" is appropriate and aligns with financial terminology in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Terminology:** Some translations use \"transferable debt instruments\" while others use \"negotiable debt instruments.\" While both are acceptable, \"negotiable\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Verb Choice:** The verbs used to describe the decline in loan demand vary between \"suppressed,\" \"constrained,\" and \"subdued.\" While all are correct, \"subdued\" and \"suppressed\" are slightly more idiomatic in this context.\n- **Fluency and Flow:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"resulting in a 2.8% decrease in total loan amounts in 2024\" (Translation 4), which is redundant since \"total loans\" already implies the amount.\n- **Cultural and Regional Nuance:** The term \"Mainland China\" is used in some translations, while others use \"Chinese mainland.\" Both are acceptable, but \"Mainland China\" is more commonly used in formal financial reports.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"negotiable debt instruments\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"subdued\" or \"suppressed\" to describe the effect of high borrowing costs on loan demand.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and avoids redundancy.\n- Maintain consistency in the phrasing of geographical references, such as using \"Mainland China\" throughout.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, primarily due to an increase in negotiable debt instruments (+13.4%). Loan demand was subdued by high borrowing costs, resulting in a 2.8% decline in total loans in 2024. Loans used in Hong Kong decreased by 2.1%, while those used outside Hong Kong fell by 5.7%. In contrast, trade financing increased by 4.6%. Loans related to Mainland China decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nIn the liabilities section of the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to a 5.1% increase in 2023. The overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024, due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy ratio is a more precise and commonly used term in financial contexts to describe the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets. While \"capital adequacy level\" is understandable, it is less standard in regulatory and financial literature. The use of \"ratio\" better reflects the quantitative nature of the measure. The translations that used \"capital adequacy level\" are acceptable but not as accurate or idiomatic as \"capital adequacy ratio.\" Additionally, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary unless the text is part of a heading or section title in a document that uses such formatting. Given the context, the most appropriate translation would be \"Capital Adequacy Ratio\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is a standard financial term and does not require special formatting unless specified.\nCapital Adequacy Ratio\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that can be refined for greater precision and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key financial metrics: capital adequacy ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and Basel III leverage ratio.\n- The use of \"locally registered authorized institutions\" or \"licensed institutions\" is consistent with financial terminology.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and clear, with appropriate reference to figures (Figure 11 and Figure 12).\n- The phrase \"significantly higher\" or \"well above\" effectively conveys the comparison to international minimum requirements.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The term \"consolidated capital ratio\" or \"comprehensive total capital ratio\" is not standard in English financial terminology. The correct term is \"capital adequacy ratio.\"\n- Some translations use \"maintained\" or \"sustained,\" which are acceptable, but \"maintained\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"the consolidated total capital ratio\" is redundant and imprecise. \"Capital adequacy ratio\" is the standard term.\n- The use of \"stood at\" or \"was\" is acceptable, but \"was\" is more neutral and commonly used in formal reporting.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the standard term \"capital adequacy ratio\" instead of \"consolidated capital ratio\" or \"comprehensive total capital ratio.\"\n- Use \"maintained\" as the preferred verb in financial contexts.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"the end of 2024\" or \"as of the end of 2024.\"\n- Use \"was\" rather than \"stood at\" for consistency and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe banking system maintained ample capital in 2024. As of the end of 2024, the capital adequacy ratio of locally registered and authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System.

Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and uses natural phrasing. It correctly uses \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" and maintains a formal tone appropriate for financial reporting. The only minor issue is the use of \"maintain\" in \"liquidity maintenance ratio,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common than \"maintenance\" as a noun in this context.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" instead of \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original Chinese. In Chinese regulatory contexts, \"Category\" is more commonly used than \"Tier\" for such classifications. The translation is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" again, which may be a misinterpretation of the original Chinese. The rest of the translation is accurate and natural.\n4. **Translation 4** is very close to Translation 1, with only minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" correctly and maintains a formal tone.\n5. **Translation 5** is also very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"By the end of 2024\" instead of \"As of the end of 2024.\" Both are acceptable, but \"As of\" is slightly more formal and precise in financial contexts.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" correctly and is otherwise accurate. However, it uses \"net stable funds ratio\" and \"core funds ratio\" instead of \"net stable funding ratio\" and \"core funding ratio,\" which are more standard terms in financial reporting. Additionally, \"significantly exceeded\" is slightly more active than \"significantly above,\" which may be less neutral in tone.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- The term \"Category\" should be used consistently, as \"Tier\" may not be the correct classification in this context.\n- \"Net stable funding ratio\" and \"core funding ratio\" are more standard in financial terminology.\n- \"As of the end of 2024\" is more formal and precise than \"By the end of 2024.\"\n- \"Significantly above\" is more neutral and commonly used in financial reporting than \"significantly exceeded.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"Category\" consistently, standard financial terminology, and formal phrasing.\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 67.0% (Figure 13). Customer deposits continue to be the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2024, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\nFigure 13 shows the liquidity ratios of approved institutions.  \nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratios of Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority)\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. The first, third, and fifth translations are the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure. They correctly use \"Designated Authorized Institutions\" or \"Designated Recognized Institutions,\" which aligns with the formal terminology used in financial regulatory contexts. However, the term \"Recognized Institutions\" may not be the exact equivalent of the original Chinese term, which is more accurately translated as \"Designated Authorized Institutions.\"\nThe second translation uses \"Recognized Institutions\" instead of \"Authorized Institutions,\" which may not be the most precise term in this context. The fourth translation is problematic because it changes the structure of the title to a full sentence (\"Figure 13 shows the liquidity ratios of approved institutions\") and incorrectly identifies the source as \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\nThe sixth translation uses \"Liquidity Ratios\" (plural) instead of \"Liquidity Ratio\" (singular), which may not be appropriate if the figure refers to a single ratio. Additionally, it uses \"Authorized Institutions\" without the term \"Designated,\" which may not fully capture the original meaning.\nThe best translation should use \"Designated Authorized Institutions\" to accurately reflect the original Chinese term.

{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2024年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港銀行業對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔，以及主要先進經濟體的最新貨幣政策實施框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n圖 5 2024年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2024年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2024年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2024年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2024年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n年內金管局舉辦14場有關香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的講座，吸引超過2,600人參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖收銀員及學生，有助提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 美元流動資金安排\n\n金管局推出美元流動資金安排的優化措施，包括將交收周期由T+1縮短至T+0，於5月24日生效。此項恆常流動資金安排可在持牌銀行有需要時為其提供備用流動性，尤其是在5月28日美國開始實施交收周期縮短至T+1的情況下。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。截至2024年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為13,068億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n在2024年，金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）發表15份對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題的研究論文，並透過五期開放取用電子期刊與全球讀者分享研究成果。研究中心亦出版兩份《Insights from MonetaryResearch》，就其近期發表的研究論文為公眾提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究工作外，研究中心舉辦一系列知識交流活動，促進與不同參與者的聯繫。年內舉辦31場以本地參與者為對象的研討會或網上研討會，探討重要貨幣及金融研究議題。在國際層面，金融學院與研究中心聯同學術機構、各國央行及國際金融機構舉辦四次國際會議及五次研討會或圓桌會議，促進就廣泛經濟及金融事務的對話與交流。\n\n這些國際活動包括：\n\n4月11日\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\n\n6月6至7日 「NBER東亞經濟研討會2024」\n\n與美國全國經濟研究所、國際結算銀行及香港科技大學商學院合辦\n\n7月15至16日\n\n與基金組織、國際結算銀行及東盟與中日韓宏觀經濟研究辦公室合辦\n\n10月14至15日\n\n第14屆年度中國經濟國際研討會—「中國及全球貿易結構的演變：挑戰與機遇」\n","en":"# Currency Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened in the first four months of 2024 before strengthening for the remainder of the year. Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate generally follows the trend of U.S. interest rates while also being influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which outlines Hong Kong's monetary policy objective of maintaining currency stability through a currency board system. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and accuracy that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy as maintaining currency stability.\n- The exchange rate range (7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD) is consistently and accurately conveyed.\n- The concept of the currency board system is generally well-represented, with most translations using \"currency board system\" or \"currency board arrangement.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"currency issuance regime\" or \"currency issuance bureau mechanism,\" which are less standard and potentially confusing. The correct and widely accepted term is \"currency board system.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are overly wordy or repetitive, such as using \"keeping the exchange rate... within the range of 7.75 to 7.85...\" multiple times, which can reduce readability.\n- **Precision in Terminology:** The term \"monetary base\" is more precise than \"money supply\" in this context, as the original text refers to the foundation of the currency system, not the broader concept of money in circulation.\n- **Cultural and Institutional Accuracy:** The \"Exchange Fund\" is the correct term for the institution holding the USD reserves in Hong Kong, not \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a different entity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the standard term \"currency board system\" to ensure clarity and consistency with international financial terminology.\n- Replace \"money supply\" with \"monetary base\" to align with the precise economic terminology used in the original text.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" rather than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" to accurately reflect the institution responsible for holding USD reserves.\n- Improve fluency by avoiding redundancy and ensuring concise, natural phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nHong Kong’s primary monetary policy objective is to maintain currency stability, ensuring the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar remains stable and stays within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. Any changes in the monetary base must be fully matched by corresponding adjustments in the US dollar reserves.\n\nThe original Chinese text is a simple, technical statement: “貨幣基礎（表1）包括：” which translates to “The monetary base (Table 1) includes:” or “Monetary base (Table 1) includes:” depending on stylistic preference.\nReview of the junior translators’ work:\n- **Translation 1, 3, and 5** use “The monetary base (Table 1) includes:” – this is grammatically correct and natural in English. The use of the definite article “the” is appropriate here, as it refers to a specific, defined concept (the monetary base) that is being referenced in the context of Table 1.\n- **Translation 2, 4, and 6** omit the article, using “Monetary base (Table 1) includes:” – while this is not grammatically incorrect, it is less natural in formal or technical English. In such contexts, the definite article is typically used when referring to a specific, well-defined concept.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nIn formal or academic writing, especially in financial or economic contexts, the use of the definite article “the” is standard when referring to specific entities like “the monetary base.” This helps to clearly indicate that the term refers to a defined and specific concept, rather than a general or abstract one. Additionally, the structure “includes:” is appropriate for introducing a list or explanation that follows in the text.\n**Improved translation:**\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n\n- Certificate of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins;  \n- Total balance in settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance); and  \n- Foreign Exchange Fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which describes how the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the exchange guarantee. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and clarity that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the entity responsible for maintaining exchange rate stability.\n- The key mechanisms—automatic interest rate adjustment and the exchange guarantee—are accurately described.\n- The trigger conditions (strong\/weak exchange guarantee) and the corresponding actions (buying\/selling HKD and USD) are generally well captured.\n- The causal relationship between the HKMA’s actions and the resulting changes in interest rates and exchange rates is preserved in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"exchange guarantee\" while others use \"convertibility undertaking\" or \"exchange rate guarantee.\" The term \"exchange guarantee\" is more commonly used in official HKMA documents, so consistency is important.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"total surplus\" or \"aggregate balance,\" which may not be the most precise terms in this context. \"Total reserves\" or \"aggregate reserves\" might be more appropriate.\n- **Clarity of Causal Relationships:** Some translations use \"thereby\" or \"thus\" in a way that slightly obscures the logical flow of the mechanism. A more direct and clear structure would enhance readability.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"Hong Kong dollar exchange rate\" multiple times, which can be streamlined for better flow.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"exchange guarantee\" or \"convertibility undertaking,\" based on the most commonly used term in HKMA publications.\n- Replace \"total surplus\" or \"aggregate balance\" with \"total reserves\" or \"aggregate reserves\" for greater accuracy.\n- Simplify the sentence structure to enhance clarity and flow, particularly in describing the causal chain of events.\n- Avoid redundancy by using more concise phrasing where possible.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) total reserves, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the 7.75 to 7.85 exchange rate band.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\nThe original text is a short heading or title, likely used in a financial or economic context. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate in terms of meaning, but they vary in formatting and style.\nTranslation 1 and 5 are identical and correctly translate the phrase \"匯率穩定\" as \"Exchange Rate Stability,\" which is a standard and formal translation used in financial contexts. However, they lack the hashtag (#) that appears in the original Chinese text.\nTranslation 2 and 6 include the hashtag, which is consistent with the original, but they use the same wording as Translation 1 and 5. This is appropriate if the hashtag is intended to be part of the title, such as in social media or online content.\nTranslation 3, \"Exchange rates are stable,\" is a complete sentence rather than a title or heading. While it conveys the same general meaning, it is not stylistically appropriate for a heading and may be more suitable as a statement or subtitle.\nTranslation 4 is similar to Translation 1 and 5 but omits the capitalization of \"Rate,\" which is not standard in formal financial terminology.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should maintain the hashtag if it is part of the original formatting, use the standard and formal title \"Exchange Rate Stability,\" and ensure proper capitalization and punctuation.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is:\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar slightly weakened as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened, primarily supported by dividend-related funding demand and increased trading activity in the stock market. In early August, concerns about a potential U.S. economic recession and expectations of faster and larger interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve triggered the unwinding of carry trade positions and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar, pushing it to the strong side of the exchange rate band. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from a surge in local stock market activity following a series of economic stimulus measures announced by mainland China. The Hong Kong dollar weakened slightly in early November, partly due to a moderation in the rise of the local stock market and partly due to strong U.S. economic performance, which gave the Federal Open Market Committee room to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded toward the end of the year due to seasonal funding demands. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rates\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖 1 2024年市場匯率,\" which translates to \"Figure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate(s).\" The junior translators have provided several variations, with minor differences in punctuation and pluralization.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate recognition of the key terms: \"Figure 1\" and \"Market Exchange Rate(s).\" However, there are a few areas for improvement:\n1. **Punctuation:** The use of a colon (\":\") after \"Figure 1\" is more standard in English for labeling figures, as seen in translations 3, 4, and 6. The absence of a colon in translations 1 and 2 makes the label less formal and less aligned with standard English conventions in academic or technical writing.\n2. **Pluralization:** The term \"Exchange Rate\" can be singular or plural depending on context. If the figure refers to a single rate (e.g., USD to CNY), then \"Exchange Rate\" is appropriate. However, if it refers to multiple rates (e.g., USD to EUR, USD to JPY, etc.), then \"Exchange Rates\" is more accurate. Given that the original text uses the singular form \"匯率,\" it is safer to assume it refers to a single rate unless context suggests otherwise.\n3. **Clarity and Fluency:** The most fluent and standard format is \"Figure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rates,\" as seen in translations 3 and 6. This version uses a colon for clarity and includes the plural form \"Rates,\" which is more likely to be appropriate in the context of a market with multiple exchange rates.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be: **\"Figure 1: 2024 Market Exchange Rates.\"** This version is grammatically correct, culturally appropriate, and aligns with standard English conventions for labeling figures in technical or academic contexts.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, consistency, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key financial figures and the relationship between the aggregate balance and the outstanding Exchange Fund instruments.\n- The use of terms like \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" or \"Exchange Fund notes and bonds\" is consistent across most translations, which is important for clarity in a financial context.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, and the overall message is clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"bills\" while others use \"notes,\" which are not interchangeable in a financial context. \"Notes\" typically refer to short-term instruments, while \"bills\" may imply different types of debt. The original text uses \"票據及債券,\" which more accurately translates to \"bills and bonds.\"\n- **Numerical formatting:** Some translations use \"HKD 44.7 billion\" while others use \"HK$44.7 billion.\" It is more standard in financial reporting to use \"HK$\" for Hong Kong dollars.\n- **Use of \"reserves\" vs. \"balance\":** Some translations use \"total reserves\" when the original refers to \"總結餘\" (aggregate balance), which is a specific term and should be translated consistently.\n- **\"Adequately supported\" vs. \"fully supported\":** The original text uses \"十足支持,\" which means \"full support.\" Using \"adequately supported\" in one translation introduces a slight deviation in meaning.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use consistent terminology: \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" should be used throughout.\n- Maintain numerical formatting consistency: Use \"HK$\" for Hong Kong dollars and ensure figures are presented in a uniform manner.\n- Use precise terms: \"Aggregate balance\" should be used consistently instead of \"total reserves.\"\n- Ensure that the meaning of \"十足支持\" is accurately reflected as \"fully supported.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nAs no exchange guarantee was triggered during the year, the aggregate balance remained relatively stable, around HK$44.7 billion. At the same time, the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased slightly, from HK$12,455 billion to HK$13,839 billion. Consequently, the aggregate balance, together with the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds, rose from HK$12,904 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$14,287 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2024 Summary Surplus (Prior to Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS), Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of U.S. interest rates, with short-term rates also influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations for a reduction in U.S. policy rates gradually intensified, HIBOR softened during the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3). However, in late September, HIBOR tightened due to seasonal end-of-quarter funding demands and active stock market trading, with overnight rates peaking above 6% at the end of the quarter. Subsequently, HIBOR remained largely stable, but rose slightly by year-end due to relatively reduced liquidity. For the full year, overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR rates fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points, respectively, ending the year at 5.65%, 4.58%, and 4.37%.\n\nIn response to the reduction in the U.S. federal funds rate target range, the basic interest rate was cut three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), declining from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the U.S. policy rate cuts, several banks reduced their prime lending rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further reduced them by 25 basis points in early November and 12.5 basis points in late December. Under these circumstances, the average interest rate on new mortgage loans fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 38.8 billion in 2023 to HKD 50 billion in 2024; the use of the discount window showed no abnormalities.\n\nFigure 3: 2024 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR)\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in the face of challenges. Despite uncertainties surrounding U.S. policy interest rates and the fragmentation of the global economic landscape, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the system. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated in its 2024 External Sector Report that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate regime. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital adequacy well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience against shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the currency base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the 112.5% trigger threshold (Figure 4). This increase was mainly driven by interest income from investments and the revaluation of investments at market value. Following arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, assets were transferred from the support portfolio to the investment portfolio, reducing the support ratio to approximately 110.08% on September 11. Subsequently, the support ratio remained largely stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong safeguard for the territory's monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of the Support Ratio in 2024\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of the Support Ratio in 2024\n\n# Monetary Policy Committee\n\nThe original text discusses the responsibilities of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the topics it examined in 2024, and the availability of related documents on the HKMA website. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the \"Currency Board Committee\" and uses \"monitoring and examining\" accurately. However, it uses \"risk-taking by Hong Kong banks with respect to non-bank financial institutions,\" which is slightly awkward. The term \"risk-taking\" is more commonly used in the context of banks taking on risk, not necessarily in relation to non-bank institutions. The structure is otherwise clear and fluent.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Monetary Policy Committee\" instead of \"Currency Board Committee,\" which is a critical error. The Monetary Policy Committee is a different entity in Hong Kong's financial structure. It also uses \"risk exposure\" more appropriately than \"risk-taking\" in this context. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n**Translation 3** again misidentifies the committee as the \"Monetary Policy Committee\" and adds unnecessary redundancy with \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" It also uses \"risk-taking\" inappropriately and repeats \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's\" unnecessarily.\n**Translation 4** correctly identifies the \"Currency Board\" but uses \"discussing\" instead of \"examining,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"risk-taking\" inappropriately and refers to the \"currency board system\" instead of the \"monetary system.\"\n**Translation 5** correctly identifies the \"Currency Board Sub-committee\" and uses \"risk exposures\" appropriately. However, it adds \"Sub-committee\" unnecessarily, which may not be the official title. It also uses \"explored\" instead of \"examined,\" which is less formal.\n**Translation 6** correctly identifies the \"Currency Board\" and uses \"risk exposure\" appropriately. It is the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure, though it could be slightly more concise.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use the correct official title: \"Currency Board Committee\" or \"Currency Board\" depending on the official designation.\n- Use \"risk exposure\" instead of \"risk-taking\" when referring to banks' exposure to non-bank financial institutions.\n- Use \"examined\" or \"reviewed\" instead of \"discussed\" or \"explored\" for a more formal tone.\n- Avoid redundancy in referring to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- Ensure clarity and conciseness in the final sentence regarding the availability of documents.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use the correct title, appropriate terminology, and maintain clarity and conciseness.\nThe Currency Board Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2024, the topics examined by the Currency Board Committee included the risk exposure of Hong Kong’s banking sector to non-bank financial institutions, as well as the latest monetary policy implementation frameworks of major advanced economies. The minutes of the Currency Board Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the currency board system submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\nBanknotes and Coins\nPaper money and coins\n# Paper Money and Coins\nPaper Money and Coins\nBanknotes and Coins\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar and largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in style and formatting that can be evaluated.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Paper Money and Coins\" with the only difference being the presence of a hashtag (#) in the second and fourth translations. The hashtag is commonly used in digital or online contexts to denote a section or topic, but it is not typically used in formal or standard English headings unless the context specifically requires it. Therefore, the versions without the hashtag are more appropriate for general use.\nThe third translation, \"Paper money and coins,\" uses lowercase letters, which is less formal and may be suitable for informal contexts but not for headings or titles where capitalization is expected.\nThe sixth translation, \"Banknotes and Coins,\" is also accurate but uses \"banknotes\" instead of \"paper money.\" While both terms are correct, \"banknotes\" is more formal and commonly used in official or financial contexts, whereas \"paper money\" is more general and widely understood.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"Paper Money and Coins\" without the hashtag, as it is clear, standard, and appropriate for most contexts. However, if the context requires a more formal or official tone, \"Banknotes and Coins\" could be a suitable alternative. The lowercase version is less appropriate for a heading, and the hashtag is unnecessary unless the context specifically calls for it.\n\nFigure 5: Circulation Amount of Banknotes by Issuing Bank as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Circulating Banknotes as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Paper Money and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government as of the End of 2024.\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Banknotes and Coins at the End of 2024\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes.\nThe original text is \"# 香港鈔票,\" which translates to \"Hong Kong banknotes\" in English. The junior translators have all provided variations of this translation, with slight differences in capitalization and the use of \"Notes\" versus \"banknotes.\" \nThe first translation, \"Hong Kong banknotes,\" is the most accurate and natural, using the standard term \"banknotes\" which is commonly used in English to refer to paper currency. The second translation, \"# Hong Kong Notes,\" uses \"Notes\" instead of \"banknotes,\" which is less precise and may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term. The third and fifth translations use \"Banknotes\" with a capital \"B,\" which is unnecessary unless it's part of a title or heading. The fourth and sixth translations use \"Notes\" without the word \"bank,\" which is too vague and could be interpreted as referring to any type of note, not specifically currency.\nThe best translation would be \"Hong Kong banknotes,\" as it is the most accurate and natural translation of the original text, using the standard term for paper currency and maintaining proper capitalization.\n\nThe original text provides a factual summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to educate the public on banknote design and anti-counterfeiting features through 14 lectures, which attracted over 2,600 participants from various professions.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"talks\" is slightly informal, but acceptable in this context. The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"within the year\" is slightly awkward. \"Helping to improve\" is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"helped to improve.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Bank counter staff\" and \"retail store cashiers\" are more precise than \"bank tellers\" and \"retail cashiers.\" The use of \"helping to enhance\" is slightly less formal than \"helped to enhance.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very strong. It uses \"lectures\" instead of \"talks\" or \"seminars,\" which is more appropriate for an official event. The structure is clear, and the use of \"thereby enhancing\" provides a smooth transition and a more formal tone.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Throughout the year\" is a natural way to express the time frame. The use of \"helping to enhance\" is slightly less formal than \"helped to enhance.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"seminars\" is appropriate. The phrase \"which helped enhance\" is slightly more formal and grammatically correct than \"helping to enhance.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, accurate, and fluent. It should use appropriate terminology for official events, such as \"lectures\" or \"seminars,\" and should clearly convey the purpose and outcome of the event. The phrase \"thereby enhancing\" provides a smooth and formal transition, making the sentence more cohesive and professional.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 14 lectures on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes this year, attracting more than 2,600 participants, including bank counter staff, retail store cashiers, and students, thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nThe original text is concise and formal, conveying that a coin collection program remains popular and directing readers to a specific section of a report. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, title formatting, and fluency.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"coin collecting program\" and \"featured in\" which are natural in English. However, it omits the official name of the authority (\"HKMA\") and uses \"Monetary Authority's Sustainable Development\" instead of the more precise \"HKMA for Sustainable Development.\"\n**Translation 2** uses \"Coin Collection Program\" with a capital \"C,\" which may be appropriate if it's an official title. However, \"citizens\" is slightly less common than \"public\" in this context. The title \"Sustainability of the Monetary Authority\" is awkwardly phrased.\n**Translation 3** uses \"scheme\" instead of \"program,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context. It correctly includes \"HKMA for Sustainable Development\" and \"2024 Sustainable Development Report,\" but the use of quotation marks around the report title is inconsistent with standard English formatting.\n**Translation 4** is similar to 3 but uses \"program\" instead of \"scheme\" and also includes the correct title. However, it still uses quotation marks around the report title, which is not standard.\n**Translation 5** introduces \"physical currency collection scheme,\" which is unnecessarily specific and not present in the original. It also uses \"well-received\" instead of \"popular,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The title formatting is inconsistent.\n**Translation 6** is the most accurate and natural. It uses \"well-received,\" which is a strong and appropriate term. It correctly identifies the chapter title as \"Sustainable Development of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the report as \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\" without unnecessary quotation marks.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"program\" or \"scheme\" consistently, depending on the official terminology.\n- Use \"well-received\" or \"popular\" based on the desired tone.\n- Ensure the chapter and report titles are correctly named and formatted without unnecessary quotation marks.\n- Maintain consistency in capitalization and terminology.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe coin collection program continues to be well-received by the public. Details of the program can be found in the chapter titled \"Sustainable Development of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# U.S. Dollar Liquidity Arrangement\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) optimization of a USD liquidity arrangement, specifically shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. It also notes the relevance of this change in the context of the U.S. implementing a similar T+1 settlement cycle starting May 28.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"USD liquidity arrangement\" and \"backup liquidity\" appropriately. However, \"which will take effect on May 24\" is slightly wordy compared to \"effective May 24.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very close to the first, with \"effective May 24\" being more concise. The use of \"in the context of\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The term \"US liquidity facility\" is slightly less precise than \"USD liquidity arrangement.\" Also, \"especially considering that\" is a bit informal for a formal context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"enhancements\" instead of \"optimized measures,\" which is a more natural term in this context. \"Standing liquidity facility\" is a good term, and the phrasing \"in light of the United States’ implementation\" is clear and formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version is very strong. It uses \"enhancements\" and \"standing liquidity facility\" effectively. The use of \"May 24th\" and \"May 28th\" is slightly more formal than necessary, but not incorrect. The phrase \"provide backup liquidity for licensed banks when needed\" is well-structured.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is very similar to the first, with \"optimized measures\" and \"U.S. dollar liquidity facility.\" The phrase \"starting to implement the shortened settlement cycle to T+1\" is slightly awkward compared to \"implementing a T+1 settlement cycle.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and precise. It should use appropriate financial terminology such as \"enhancements\" or \"optimized measures,\" \"liquidity arrangement\" or \"liquidity facility,\" and \"effective\" rather than \"which will take effect.\" The phrase \"in light of\" is appropriate for indicating relevance. The date format should be consistent and concise (e.g., \"May 24\" rather than \"May 24th\").\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced enhancements to its U.S. dollar liquidity arrangement, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing liquidity facility provides backup liquidity to licensed banks when needed, particularly in light of the U.S. implementing a T+1 settlement cycle starting May 28.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 外匯基金票據及債券,\" which translates to \"Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with minor differences in terminology and formatting.\nThe first and second translations both use \"Notes and Bonds,\" which is accurate. However, they include a \"#\" symbol, which may be unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement or heading style. The third translation omits the \"#\" symbol but otherwise matches the first two. The fourth translation uses \"Exchange Fund\" instead of \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is a slight deviation from the original. While \"Exchange Fund\" may be understood in context, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is more precise and commonly used in financial terminology. The fifth and sixth translations use \"Bills and Bonds\" instead of \"Notes and Bonds.\" \"Bills\" and \"Notes\" are both financial instruments, but \"Notes\" is more commonly used in the context of government or fund-issued debt instruments. \"Bonds\" is accurate, so the use of \"Notes and Bonds\" is preferable for clarity and consistency with standard financial terminology.\nIn terms of formatting, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is optional and depends on the context in which the translation will be used. If it is part of a document or list that uses numbered headings, then it may be appropriate. Otherwise, it may be better to omit it for a cleaner, more professional appearance.\nIn summary, the best translation would be \"Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds,\" as it accurately reflects the original Chinese text, uses standard financial terminology, and maintains a professional and clear format.\n\nThe original text discusses the smooth operation of the Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Program and provides a figure for the nominal value of outstanding instruments as of the end of 2024. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and \"bills and bonds,\" which is accurate, but \"130.68 billion\" is inconsistent with the original figure of \"13,068億港元,\" which is 1,306.8 billion, not 130.68 billion. This is a critical numerical error.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Programme\" and correctly converts the figure to \"1.3068 trillion,\" which is equivalent to 1,306.8 billion. However, \"Notes and Bonds\" may not be the exact term used in the original, which says \"票據及債券\" (bills and bonds), and \"trillion\" is less commonly used in financial contexts in Hong Kong, where \"billion\" is more standard.\n**Translation 3** uses \"Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Programme\" and correctly uses \"bills and bonds,\" but incorrectly states \"13,068 billion,\" which is 13 trillion, a clear numerical error.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Programme\" and correctly states \"1,306.8 billion,\" but uses \"HK$1,306.8 billion\" with the dollar sign, which is acceptable but less formal than \"HKD.\"\n**Translation 5** uses \"foreign exchange fund notes and bonds program\" with lowercase \"foreign exchange fund,\" which is less formal and may not match the official title. It also correctly uses \"1,306.8 billion.\"\n**Translation 6** uses \"Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Scheme\" and correctly states \"1,306.8 billion.\" However, \"Scheme\" may not be the exact term used in the original, which says \"計劃\" (plan or program).\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the exact terminology from the original, which is \"外匯基金票據及債券計劃\" (Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Program). It should also use the correct numerical value of \"1,306.8 billion HKD\" and maintain a formal tone appropriate for financial reporting. The use of \"HKD\" is preferred over \"HK$\" in formal contexts, and \"billion\" is more standard in Hong Kong financial statements than \"trillion.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Program continues to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the nominal value of outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds amounted to approximately HKD 1,306.8 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\nThe original Chinese text is \"表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券,\" which translates to \"Table 2: Unpaid Foreign Exchange Fund Instruments and Bonds.\" The term \"未償還\" can be translated as \"outstanding,\" \"unpaid,\" or \"unreimbursed,\" depending on the context. In financial terminology, \"outstanding\" is the most commonly used and appropriate term to describe obligations or instruments that remain unpaid or unfulfilled.\nAmong the translations provided, the first, third, and fifth translations use \"Outstanding,\" which is the most accurate and natural choice in this context. The second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Bills,\" which is less precise than \"Notes\" in financial terminology. \"Notes\" typically refer to debt instruments issued by governments or corporations, while \"Bills\" are usually short-term instruments, often issued by governments.\nThe fourth translation uses \"Unpaid,\" which is less standard in financial contexts compared to \"Outstanding.\" While \"Unpaid\" is understandable, it lacks the nuance and formality that \"Outstanding\" provides in financial reporting.\nTherefore, the best translation would be \"Table 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds,\" as it accurately reflects the financial terminology and maintains the formality and clarity of the original text.\n\n# Monetary Study\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research (the Centre), which is responsible for research under the School of Finance, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial issues of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Centre also shared its research findings with a global audience through five open-access e-journals. Additionally, the Centre published two issues of \"Insights from Monetary Research,\" providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of its recent research papers.\n\nIn addition to its research activities, the research center organizes a series of knowledge exchange events to foster connections with diverse stakeholders. Throughout the year, it hosted 31 seminars or webinars targeting local participants, exploring important monetary and financial research topics. On an international level, the School of Finance and the research center collaborated with academic institutions, central banks of various countries, and international financial institutions to host four international conferences and five seminars or roundtable discussions, promoting dialogue and exchange on a wide range of economic and financial matters.\n\nThese are all extremely minimal translations of the original Chinese text, which is simply \"這些國際活動包括：\". Each junior translator has provided the exact same translation: \"These international activities include:\".\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nWhile the translations are grammatically correct and convey the basic meaning of the original sentence, they are incomplete and lack the nuance and context that would make them suitable for a professional or formal setting. The original text is likely the beginning of a list or enumeration of international activities, and the colon at the end suggests that more content will follow. However, the translations provided do not reflect this structure or intent fully.\nThe translations are fluent in terms of grammar and vocabulary, but they are overly simplistic and do not reflect the tone or formality that might be expected in a professional or academic context. Additionally, the use of the colon at the end of the sentence in the original Chinese suggests that the sentence is not complete and is meant to introduce a list or explanation. The translations, however, end with a colon in English, which is appropriate, but they do not provide any further elaboration or context.\nA more complete and natural translation would include a brief introductory phrase that sets the tone for the list that follows. For example, \"These international activities include the following:\" or \"Among these international activities are:\" would be more natural and contextually appropriate in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThese international activities include the following:\n\nApril 11th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"4月11日,\" which translates to \"April 11th\" in English. All six junior translators have provided either \"April 11\" or \"April 11th,\" which are both acceptable formats for expressing a date in English. However, there are subtle differences in formality and usage that can be considered.\n\"April 11th\" is the more formal and commonly used format in written English, especially in contexts such as official documents, news articles, or formal correspondence. It includes the ordinal suffix \"-th,\" which is standard in English for dates. On the other hand, \"April 11\" is more concise and is often used in informal contexts, such as in casual conversation or in some digital formats like calendars or schedules.\nGiven that the original text is a straightforward date without any additional context, the most appropriate and natural translation would be \"April 11th,\" as it aligns with standard English conventions for writing dates in formal or neutral contexts. This format is widely recognized and avoids any ambiguity that might arise from omitting the ordinal suffix. Therefore, \"April 11th\" is the most accurate and natural translation of \"4月11日.\"\n\nCo-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nThe original phrase \"與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\" translates to \"co-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\" The junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately, using variations of \"co-organized\" or \"jointly organized\" and correctly identifying the two institutions involved.\nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Accurate identification of the two organizations: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\"\n- Use of appropriate terms such as \"co-organized\" or \"jointly organized,\" which are standard in formal contexts.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Minor inconsistencies in the use of \"the\" before \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\" While not grammatically incorrect, the inclusion of \"the\" can vary based on style guides or institutional preferences.\n- The term \"co-hosted\" used by the second junior translator is less precise in this context, as the phrase refers to organizing an event, not hosting it.\nImprovements could focus on consistency in the use of \"the\" and selecting the most precise verb. \"Co-organized\" is the most neutral and accurate term in this context, and the inclusion of \"the\" before the university's name is standard in formal English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nCo-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJune 6-7, \"NBER East Asia Economic Conference 2024\"\n\nCo-organized with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and the School of Business at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJuly 15 to 16\nJuly 15–16\nJuly 15–16\n\nCo-organized with the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office\nThe original Chinese text lists three organizations with which an event or initiative is co-organized. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the organizations and the structure of the phrase.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the full names of the organizations. However, it uses \"fund organizations\" instead of \"Fund Organization\" in the original, which may be a minor inconsistency.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation uses \"fund organizations\" instead of \"Fund Organization,\" which is not accurate. Also, \"ASEAN+China+Japan\" is not the standard way to refer to the ASEAN+3 grouping. The term \"Macroeconomic Research Office\" is correctly used.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses the standard abbreviations (IMF, BIS) and the full name of the ASEAN+3 office. However, it adds \"(BIS)\" in parentheses, which is unnecessary and slightly disrupts the flow.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is concise and uses the standard abbreviations (IMF, BIS). However, it uses \"ASEAN+3\" without expanding it, which may be less clear for readers unfamiliar with the term.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation uses \"Fund Organization\" and \"International Bank for Settlements,\" which are not the standard names. \"Fund Organization\" is not a recognized term, and \"International Bank for Settlements\" is an incorrect name for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses the correct full names of the organizations and the standard \"ASEAN+3\" designation. It is the most natural and professional of the translations.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the standard and widely recognized names of the organizations. \"International Monetary Fund\" and \"Bank for International Settlements\" are the official names. \"ASEAN+3\" is the standard term for the grouping of ASEAN with China, Japan, and South Korea.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\nThe original text is a short heading: \"# 銀行體系穩定\". The key elements to translate are the hashtag symbol, the term \"銀行體系\" (banking system), and the adjective \"穩定\" (stable\/stability). \nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality:\n1. \"Banking system stability\" – This is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, it omits the hashtag symbol, which may be important depending on the context (e.g., social media, headings, or tags).\n2. \"Banking system stability\" – Identical to the first translation, with the same strengths and weaknesses.\n3. \"# Banking System Stability\" – This includes the hashtag, which is appropriate, and capitalizes the words in a title case format, which is suitable for headings. However, the space between the hashtag and the word \"Banking\" may be unnecessary or inconsistent with common usage.\n4. \"Banking system stable.\" – This translation is grammatically incorrect. The adjective \"stable\" is not used correctly in this context. The original text uses the noun form \"穩定\" (stability), not the adjective \"穩定的\" (stable).\n5. \"#BankingSystemStable\" – This translation includes the hashtag but merges the words without spaces, which is not standard in English for headings or titles. It also uses the adjective form \"Stable\" instead of the noun \"Stability.\"\n6. \"Banking System Stability\" – This is the most accurate translation in terms of grammar and vocabulary. It uses the correct noun form \"Stability\" and capitalizes the words in title case, which is appropriate for a heading. However, it omits the hashtag symbol.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the hashtag should be included if it is relevant to the context, and the words should be properly capitalized in title case. The noun form \"Stability\" is more appropriate than the adjective \"Stable\" in this context.\nTherefore, the best translation would be: \"# Banking System Stability\" or \"#BankingSystemStability\" depending on whether a space is preferred after the hashtag. However, the most natural and commonly used format would be \"# Banking System Stability\" with a space after the hashtag.\n\nDespite macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2024. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and ensured the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning. It also provided regulatory guidance and supported the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing the operational resilience and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including a generative artificial intelligence \"sandbox.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core content of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the key initiatives: the launch of the \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Charter 2.0,\" the introduction of \"SmartSafe Deposit,\" the implementation of a cooling-off period for unsecured credit products, and the provision of AI guidelines.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology, such as \"cooling-off period,\" \"generative artificial intelligence,\" and \"cross-border wealth management.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear, and the translations maintain the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistencies in terminology:** Some translations use different names for the same program, such as \"Credit Information Express,\" \"Credit Information Link,\" \"CreditGo,\" and \"Credit Information Network.\" The original text uses “信資通,” which should be consistently translated as \"Credit Information Link\" or \"Credit Information Connect.\"\n- **Inaccurate or inconsistent references to the HKMA:** One translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"We have also introduced 'Smart Deposit'\" instead of \"launched\" or \"introduced,\" which may sound less formal or less aligned with official HKMA language.\n- **Cultural and contextual appropriateness:** The term \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Charter 2.0\" is accurate, but some translations omit the \"Charter\" in favor of \"Agreement\" or \"Charter 2.0\" without the full name, which may be less precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the full and consistent name of the organization: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Ensure consistent terminology for all programs, such as \"Credit Information Link\" for “信資通.”\n- Use formal and fluent English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n- Maintain the logical flow and clarity of the original text while ensuring that the English reads naturally to an English-speaking audience.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Charter 2.0\" to enhance consumer protection in banking. It has also introduced \"SmartSafe Deposit\" to help depositors effectively safeguard their deposits, and implemented a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA has provided guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services, and has worked closely with the industry to offer an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions. The HKMA has also improved customer experience and ensured investor protection by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the pilot program for the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" and simplifying the procedures for selling investment and insurance products. This year, the HKMA has completed the full transition of personal credit information services to the \"Credit Information Link.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) role in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing efforts, along with specific achievements and initiatives. However, there are notable differences in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA's role and the key initiatives it has undertaken.\n- The percentages and figures are consistently translated, and the structure of the sentences is largely accurate.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology related to financial crime and regulatory frameworks.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)\" while others use \"Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force\" or \"Working Group.\" The original text refers to \"反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組,\" which is best translated as \"Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more verbose or awkward in phrasing, such as \"the number of intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023\" versus \"intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023.\"\n- **Cultural and Institutional Accuracy:** The term \"反訛騙\" is best translated as \"anti-fraud\" rather than \"anti-deception\" or \"anti-scam,\" which is more commonly used in financial regulatory contexts.\n- **Clarity of Legal Terms:** The phrase \"法例修訂的諮詢\" is translated as \"consultation on legal amendments\" in most translations, which is accurate, but \"consultation on legislative amendments\" is slightly more precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent and accurate terminology for the intelligence unit and task force.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency by avoiding overly wordy phrasing.\n- Maintain a formal yet natural tone appropriate for regulatory and financial contexts.\n- Ensure that legal and institutional terms are translated with precision and consistency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a vital role in Hong Kong’s regime for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. By enhancing the speed and volume of intelligence shared through the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% rise in the freezing or confiscation of criminal proceeds. Consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate information sharing among banks to assist in the detection and prevention of financial crimes received widespread support. In April, the HKMA provided guidance based on the findings of a thematic review of the Transaction Monitoring System, and in September, it launched a program to encourage the industry to adopt artificial intelligence for monitoring suspicious activities. The HKMA also collaborated with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimize the “Suspicious Account Alert” mechanism and strengthen outreach efforts, and issued guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and stopping authorized payment fraud.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Corporation has optimized various aspects of the deposit protection scheme to enhance safeguards for depositors.\n\nTo ensure the credibility of the resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has implemented resolution standards, requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing feasibility challenges in the resolution process to ensure sufficient financial resources and operational continuity, as well as enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the objectives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the essential financial services required by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system through their operational practices, or even in extreme cases through disorderly failures. As the regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" In fact, as the resolution authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to ensure that authorized institutions can be orderly wound down if they become unsustainable. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions. To implement Hong Kong's resolution mechanism, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\nThe original text discusses the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in overseeing financial market infrastructures to ensure their safety, efficiency, and resilience against financial crises. The junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the HKMA as the responsible authority and accurately conveys the purpose of its oversight. However, it uses \"designating and supervising\" which is slightly less precise than \"designating and overseeing.\" The sentence structure is clear, but the repetition of \"financial market infrastructures\" could be streamlined.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"monetary and financial systems\" consistently, which is more natural than \"currency and financial system.\" However, the phrase \"prevent their stability from being affected\" is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 3** uses \"financial management officers\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is inaccurate. It also uses \"monetary and financial systems\" and \"prevent disruptions to their stability,\" which are more natural than some of the other translations. However, the use of \"helps safeguard\" is less formal than \"can safeguard.\"\n**Translation 4** incorrectly identifies the \"Financial Secretary\" as the responsible authority. It uses \"ensure the safety\" instead of \"safeguard,\" which is slightly less idiomatic. The phrase \"prevent disruptions in the operation\" is clear but could be more concise.\n**Translation 5** uses \"financial management officers\" again, which is incorrect. It uses \"that infrastructure\" instead of \"such infrastructures,\" which is less appropriate in the context. The phrase \"prevents disruptions in its operation from affecting its stability\" is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 6** again incorrectly identifies the \"Financial Secretary\" as the responsible authority. It uses \"currency and financial system\" and \"operational failures,\" which are accurate but slightly less natural than \"operational interruptions.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately identify the HKMA as the responsible authority, use consistent and natural phrasing, and avoid redundancy. It should also maintain the formal tone appropriate for a regulatory text while ensuring clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructures. The purpose of the HKMA's oversight of these infrastructures is to promote their overall safety and efficiency, reduce systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures against financial crises can safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems and prevent disruptions in their stability caused by operational interruptions.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) granted banking licenses to one bank incorporated in Hong Kong and another bank incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also approved a dealer broker incorporated outside Hong Kong to become a money broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, one restricted license bank, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor more information about recognized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323, respectively.\n\n# Reviewing the Three-Tier Banking System\nThe original title, “# 檢討銀行三級制,” translates to “Review of the Three-Tier Banking System.” The junior translators have produced several variations of this title, with minor differences in wording and punctuation.\nThe first translation, “Reviewing the Three-Tier Banking System,” uses the present participle “reviewing,” which suggests an ongoing action rather than a completed or formal review. This may not be the most appropriate tone for a title that likely refers to a formal analysis or evaluation.\nThe second and fifth translations, “Review of the Three-Tier Banking System,” are the most accurate and natural in English. They use the preposition “of” correctly and convey the intended meaning clearly and concisely.\nThe third translation, “Reviewing the Three-Tier System for Banks,” changes the structure slightly by using “for Banks” instead of “Banking System.” While this is grammatically correct, it is less idiomatic and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term “Three-Tier System.”\nThe fourth, sixth, and fifth translations all include the hashtag “#” at the beginning, which is consistent with the original text. However, in English, the use of hashtags in titles is less common unless the content is intended for social media or online platforms. If the title is for a formal document or article, the hashtag may be unnecessary.\nIn terms of fluency, grammar, and cultural appropriateness, the most natural and professional translation is “Review of the Three-Tier Banking System.” It is concise, clear, and uses standard English phrasing. It also maintains the structure and intent of the original title without unnecessary alterations.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be to use “Review of the Three-Tier Banking System” without the hashtag, unless the context specifically requires it. This version is the most accurate, natural, and appropriate for a formal or academic setting.\nReview of the Three-Tier Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed its public consultation on simplifying the three-tier banking system to a two-tier system. Respondents generally supported the proposed simplification. Having considered the feedback received, the HKMA has put forward several new key considerations to streamline the transition process and minimize the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# \"Virtual Bank\" Rebrands\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed a public consultation on renaming \"Virtual Bank\" to \"Digital Bank.\" The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the Authority subsequently revised the statutory guidance \"Recognition of Digital Banks\" in October, with the proposal officially taking effect.\n\n# Review of Digital Banking\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banking, with the review report published in August. The review indicated that digital banking has achieved the three policy objectives for introducing digital banks in Hong Kong: promoting fintech and innovation, providing new customer experiences, and promoting financial inclusion. Under the diversified development of digital and traditional banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes the current number of digital bank licenses is appropriate, and there is no need to introduce more digital bank participants into the market at this stage. The revised guidelines, \"Recognition of Digital Banks,\" issued in October, relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking services beyond retail banking, and permitting the establishment of physical branches under reasonable circumstances from the perspective of customer experience and business strategy, provided that digital banks continue to primarily provide banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Banking License Fees\n\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, stating that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed a review of licensing fees within the year and increased the fee levels in June. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and fluency.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. The term \"license fees\" is used, which is acceptable, but \"raised the fee levels\" is slightly less natural than \"increased.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the authority as the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"licensing fees\" and \"increased the fee levels.\" This is accurate and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Same as the second, with no differences in content or quality.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses the correct abbreviation \"HKMA\" and \"licensing fees,\" but \"raised the fee level\" is singular, which is inconsistent with the original plural \"費用水平\" (fee levels). Also, \"review of licensing fees\" is slightly more natural than \"review of license fees.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is imprecise. \"Raised the fee level\" is again singular, and \"review of licensing fees\" is better than \"license fees.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Same as the second, with correct terminology and natural phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct full name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\") or its standard abbreviation (\"HKMA\"), use \"licensing fees\" for consistency with financial terminology, and use the plural \"fee levels\" to match the original. The verb \"increased\" is more natural in this context than \"raised.\" Additionally, \"within the year\" is slightly awkward; \"during the year\" or \"within this year\" is more natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed its review of licensing fees during the year and increased the fee levels in June.\n\n# Hong Kong Company Migration System\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing support to the government in introducing a company migration regime, including legislative assistance related to the Banking Ordinance and other relevant laws. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\nTranslation 1 uses \"deregistration system,\" which is inaccurate in this context. The term \"migration regime\" or \"re-domiciliation regime\" is more appropriate for describing the process of moving a company's registered office. It also uses \"has provided\" in the present perfect tense, which may not be the most natural choice here.\nTranslation 2 uses \"deregistration system\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"provides\" in the present tense, which may not align with the original text's implication of ongoing or completed support.\nTranslation 3 correctly uses \"migration regime\" and \"HKMA\" with parentheses. It uses \"assisting with the legislative process for amending,\" which is more natural than \"assisting in the revision of.\"\nTranslation 4 is similar to 3 but uses the present continuous tense \"is providing,\" which may not be the best fit if the support is a completed or ongoing action rather than a current one.\nTranslation 5 is the most accurate in terms of terminology, using \"re-domiciliation regime\" and \"relating to the HKMA.\" It also uses the present continuous tense, which may be appropriate depending on the context.\nTranslation 6 uses \"transfer of registration system,\" which is not a standard term in this context. It also uses \"Monetary Authority\" without the \"HK\" prefix, which is less precise.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use \"re-domiciliation regime\" or \"migration regime\" to accurately reflect the process of moving a company's registered office. It should also use the present perfect tense \"has provided\" to indicate completed support, and ensure that \"HKMA\" is used consistently with the full name and acronym.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has provided support to the government in introducing a company re-domiciliation regime in Hong Kong, including assisting with the legislative process for amending the Banking Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, as well as other legislation relating to the HKMA.\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nThis year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 174 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, and risk management. To continue strengthening the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and conducted 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. In addition, the HKMA carried out on-site reviews of the various business operations of authorized institutions, including governance and practices related to credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the original text, the six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning and structure of the passage. However, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to formal, professional tone. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key points: the increasing use of technology by authorized institutions, the regulatory focus on operational and technology risk management, the HKMA’s strengthened oversight of climate risk management, and the recognition by The Asian Banker.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"authorized institutions,\" \"supervision,\" \"climate risk management,\" and \"financial stability.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the flow of ideas is maintained.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"recognized institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is less precise in the context of financial regulation.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"authorized institutions\" but says \"sound economic growth\" which is slightly less formal than \"sustainable\" or \"robust.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"authorized institutions\" and \"robust economic growth,\" which is appropriate, but \"earning it the award for\" is slightly informal.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"licensed institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which may be regionally specific and less standard in this context.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"business operation risks\" instead of \"operational risks,\" which is less standard in regulatory contexts.\n- **Translation 6** is the most consistent in terminology and tone, using \"authorized institutions,\" \"operational and technology risk management,\" and \"steady economic growth.\" However, \"has become another regulatory focus\" is slightly less precise than \"has become another key regulatory focus.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"authorized institutions\" is more standard in financial regulatory contexts than \"recognized,\" \"licensed,\" or \"business operation.\"\n- \"Operational and technology risk management\" is more precise than \"operational and technological risks\" or \"business operation risks.\"\n- \"Key regulatory focus\" is more formal and precise than \"another regulatory focus.\"\n- \"Robust economic growth\" or \"sustainable economic growth\" is more appropriate than \"steady\" or \"sound\" in the context of regulatory achievements.\n- The phrase \"earning it the title of\" is slightly informal; \"awarded the title of\" or \"selected as\" is more formal and appropriate for a professional context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nGiven the growing adoption of technology by authorized institutions, the management of operational and technology risk has become another key regulatory focus. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also further strengthened its supervision of climate risk management at authorized institutions to enhance their capacity to respond to climate change. The HKMA’s efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting robust economic growth in an uncertain global economic environment have been recognized, earning it the title of \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" from The Asian Banker.\n\nMs. Zhu Liqiao, Assistant Vice President (Bank Supervision), representing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the \"Asia-Pacific Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Agency Award\" presented by the magazine \"Asia Banker\".  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe first translation is accurate and fluent, but it uses \"Assistant Vice President\" which may not be the exact title used by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The title \"Assistant Managing Director\" or \"Deputy Governor\" might be more appropriate depending on the official structure. Also, \"Asia Banker\" should be \"The Asian Banker\" for proper noun consistency.  \n**Translation 2:**  \nDeputy President (Bank Supervision) Ms. Zhu Liqiao (center) received the \"Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Authority in Asia-Pacific\" award on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, presented by Asian Banker magazine.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is fluent and accurate, but \"Deputy President\" may not be the correct title. The placement of the title \"Bank Supervision\" is awkwardly placed. Also, \"Asian Banker\" should be \"The Asian Banker\" for consistency with proper nouns.  \n**Translation 3:**  \nMs. Judy Chu, Deputy Governor (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA (center), received on behalf of the HKMA the \"Asia's Best Macroeconomic Regulator in the Asia-Pacific Region\" award presented by The Asian Banker magazine.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is fluent and accurate, but \"Judy Chu\" is not the correct name of the person mentioned in the original text. The name should be \"Zhu Liqiao.\" Also, \"Asia's Best Macroeconomic Regulator in the Asia-Pacific Region\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.  \n**Translation 4:**  \nMs. Catherine Zhu Likiu, Deputy Governor (Banking Supervision) of the Financial Supervisory Commission, accepted the “Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Institution in Asia-Pacific” award presented by The Asian Banker magazine on behalf of the FSC.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is inaccurate. The original text refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC). Also, the name \"Catherine Zhu Likiu\" is incorrect. The correct name is \"Zhu Liqiao.\"  \n**Translation 5:**  \nMs. Zhu Liqiao, Assistant Governor (Banking Supervision), representing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the \"Asia-Pacific Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Authority Award\" presented by Asian Banker magazine.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is accurate and fluent, but \"Assistant Governor\" may not be the exact title used by the HKMA. Also, \"Asian Banker\" should be \"The Asian Banker\" for consistency with proper nouns.  \n**Translation 6:**  \nAssistant Managing Director (Banking Supervision) Ms. Zhu Liqiao (center) represents the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in receiving the “Best Macroprudential Regulator of the Year – Asia Pacific” award presented by The Asian Banker magazine.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is fluent and accurate, but \"Macroprudential Regulator\" may not be the exact term used in the original text. The original mentions \"macroeconomic regulatory agency,\" which is slightly different from \"macroprudential.\" Also, the placement of the title \"Banking Supervision\" is awkwardly placed.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nMs. Zhu Liqiao, Assistant Managing Director (Banking Supervision) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (center), received the \"Asia-Pacific Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Agency Award\" presented by The Asian Banker magazine on behalf of the HKMA.  \nThis translation is accurate, fluent, and respects the proper titles and names used in the original text. It also ensures consistency with proper nouns and accurately conveys the meaning and nuance of the original.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related businesses, as well as consumer protection matters. These inspections are complemented by thematic assessments to review new initiatives or areas identified as posing a higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nAdditional regulatory efforts focused on operational resilience include a HKMA investigation and self-assessments conducted by authorized institutions to review implementation progress and identify areas requiring improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at both bilateral and industry levels regarding the development of frameworks and practices.  \nFurthermore, regulatory work focuses on assessing the strategies and approaches of authorized institutions in approving and managing ongoing risks for specific credit portfolios, such as commercial property and small and medium-sized enterprise loans.  \nThis includes holding consultative meetings with authorized institutions to examine their implementation of the HKMA's Regulatory Policy Manual, Module GS-1, \"Climate Risk Management.\"\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe original text provides a concise summary of loan volume changes in 2024 and 2023, referencing two tables for further details. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the percentage decreases in loan volumes for 2024 and 2023.\n- The reference to \"Table 2\" and \"Table 3\" is consistently included, maintaining the original structure.\n- The use of \"loans and advances\" is appropriate and consistent with financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the total loan amount\" and \"the total amount of related loans,\" which is slightly repetitive and less fluent.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"volume\" instead of \"amount,\" which is acceptable but less common in financial reporting.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"volume\" again and places \"Mainland China-related loans\" in a slightly awkward structure.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and is fluent, but uses \"related loans in Mainland China\" which could be more precise.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly states that the loans are in Hong Kong, which is a critical error given the original text refers to \"內地\" (Mainland China).\n- **Translation 6** uses \"38,590 billion HK dollars\" instead of \"HKD 385.9 billion,\" which is a significant numerical error.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"total loan amount\" or \"total loan volume\" consistently, depending on the preferred financial terminology.\n- Ensure that \"Mainland China\" is clearly specified to avoid confusion.\n- Correct the numerical representation of \"38,590億港元\" to \"HKD 385.9 billion.\"\n- Maintain a consistent and fluent structure, avoiding redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe total loan amount decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared to a 3.6% decline in 2023. Table 2 shows the growth rates of various types of loans and advances. Total loans related to Mainland China decreased by 8.7% to HKD 385.9 billion in 2024 (Table 3).\n\nGiven the original text, the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key factors influencing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) monitoring: high interest rates, unresolved debt issues among mainland property developers, and a weak local commercial property market.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main data points (loan ratios) are accurately translated.\n- Most translations use \"specific classification loan ratio\" or \"specifically classified loans,\" which is a direct translation of the term used in the original text. However, in financial contexts, \"non-performing loan ratio\" is more commonly used in English, though the original uses \"特定分類貸款比率,\" which is more accurately translated as \"specific classification loan ratio.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"will continue\" instead of \"continued,\" which changes the tense and slightly alters the meaning. The original text refers to actions that were taken in 2024, so \"continued\" is more appropriate.\n- The term \"licensed institutions\" is used in one translation, but the original text says \"認可機構,\" which is more accurately translated as \"authorized institutions.\"\n- The phrase \"specific classification loan ratio\" is used consistently, but in financial English, \"non-performing loan ratio\" is more standard. However, since the original uses \"特定分類貸款比率,\" it may be a specific term used by the HKMA, so it should be retained unless there is a clear, widely accepted equivalent.\n- Some translations use \"real estate\" instead of \"property,\" which is acceptable but \"property\" is more commonly used in financial contexts in Hong Kong.\n- The phrase \"related loans in mainland China\" is slightly awkward; \"related loans on the mainland\" or \"mainland-related loans\" is more natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain the original term \"specific classification loan ratio\" if it is a defined term used by the HKMA, but consider adding a note in parentheses if necessary for clarity.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" instead of \"licensed institutions\" to match the original.\n- Ensure consistent use of past tense (\"continued\") to reflect actions taken in 2024.\n- Use \"property\" instead of \"real estate\" for consistency with the original and common usage in Hong Kong financial contexts.\n- Refine phrasing such as \"related loans in mainland China\" to \"mainland-related loans\" for smoother readability.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nGiven that interest rates remain high, some mainland property developers' debt issues have not yet been fully resolved, and the local commercial property market remains weak, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. The banking system's asset quality continued to face pressure throughout the year, but the risk situation remained manageable. The specific classification loan ratio for the banking system was 1.96% at the end of 2024, up from 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the specific classification loan ratio for mainland-related loans decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% during the same period.\n\nThis year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic review to examine the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions. The review will focus on several key areas, including risk exposure to more vulnerable industries, secured and unsecured lending to private banking and wealth management clients, unsecured retail loans, monitoring of credit risk related to overseas operations, and risk exposure to non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\nAll six translations are essentially identical in content and structure, with only minor differences in punctuation and spacing. The primary variation lies in the use of a colon (\":\") after \"Table 2\" and whether there is a space between \"Table 2\" and the title. In formal English, it is standard to use a colon after the table number to introduce the title, and to include a space between the number and the colon. For example, \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\" is the most conventional and widely accepted format.\nThe term \"Loans and Advances\" is appropriate in a financial context, as \"advances\" can refer to short-term loans or credit extensions. The translation is concise, accurate, and culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience familiar with financial terminology.\nNo major improvements are necessary, as the translations are already correct and fluent. However, to ensure consistency with formal English conventions, the preferred format would be \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances.\"\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to standard English conventions. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **\"Table 3: Growth of Mainland-related Loans\"** – This translation is concise and grammatically correct. However, \"Mainland-related\" may be slightly ambiguous, as it could imply loans related to the mainland in a broader sense, not necessarily loans issued within the mainland.\n2. **\"Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\"** – This is a clear and natural translation. It accurately conveys that the loans are related and located within Mainland China. It is grammatically sound and culturally appropriate.\n3. **\"Table 3 Growth of Related Loans Domestically\"** – While grammatically correct, \"domestically\" is vague and could be interpreted as referring to the domestic context of the country where the translation is being used, rather than specifically Mainland China. This may cause confusion.\n4. **\"Table 3 Mainland China Related Loan Growth\"** – This translation is somewhat awkward due to the lack of a preposition between \"Mainland China\" and \"Related Loan Growth.\" It reads more like a title without proper structure, which is less professional.\n5. **\"Mainland China’s related loan growth (as shown in Table 3)\"** – This translation is grammatically correct but places the table reference at the end, which is less conventional for a table title. It also uses possessive form (\"Mainland China’s\") which may not be necessary or standard in this context.\n6. **\"Table 3 Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\"** – This is identical to the second translation and is therefore equally strong.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation is **\"Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\"**. It is clear, grammatically correct, and adheres to standard English conventions for table titles. It avoids ambiguity by specifying \"Mainland China\" rather than using \"Mainland-related,\" which could be misinterpreted. It also maintains a formal tone appropriate for a financial or economic context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\n# Alleviating Cash Flow Pressure for Bank Customers\n\n# Supporting Local Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises\nThe original Chinese text is a concise title or heading, likely used in a campaign, initiative, or policy statement aimed at promoting or assisting local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to one another, with only minor differences in phrasing and punctuation.\nThe first translation, \"Supporting local small and medium-sized enterprises,\" is grammatically correct and natural in English. However, it lacks the hashtag (#) that appears in several of the other translations, which may be important for consistency with the original format.\nThe second and fifth translations, \"# Support Local SMEs,\" are concise and use the common abbreviation \"SMEs\" for \"small and medium-sized enterprises.\" This is a widely accepted abbreviation in both business and policy contexts. However, the use of all caps for \"Local\" may be considered less formal or less natural in some contexts.\nThe third translation, \"Support Local Small and Medium-sized Enterprises,\" is grammatically correct and uses full terms without abbreviations. It is slightly more verbose than the other translations but is still appropriate for a title or heading.\nThe fourth translation, \"# Support Local Small and Medium Enterprises,\" is similar to the third but omits the hyphen in \"medium-sized,\" using \"medium Enterprises\" instead. This is a minor variation in phrasing but still acceptable.\nThe sixth translation, \"Supporting Local Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,\" is very similar to the first but uses the present participle \"Supporting\" instead of the gerund \"Supporting.\" This is a subtle difference in tone, with \"Supporting\" suggesting an ongoing or active effort, while \"Support\" is more direct and declarative.\nOverall, the best translation would be one that is concise, natural, and consistent with the original format. It should use the common abbreviation \"SMEs\" and include the hashtag if it is part of the original's formatting. It should also maintain a professional and formal tone appropriate for a title or heading.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\n# Support Local SMEs\nThis translation is concise, uses the common abbreviation \"SMEs,\" includes the hashtag as in the original, and maintains a professional and formal tone appropriate for a title or heading.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a vital cornerstone of Hong Kong's economy, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing. Since the HKMA and the banking sector established the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" (SME Coordination Mechanism) in 2019, multiple rounds of SME support measures have been introduced, including the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Scheme,\" to help SMEs navigate the challenges faced during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector introduced additional measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that continue to face challenges due to economic transformation, and to assist SMEs in sustaining their development and upgrading their operations.\n\n# New Support Measures for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced nine measures in March through the SME Coordination Mechanism to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing and supporting their development.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is incorrect. The correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Also, \"continued development\" is slightly less natural than \"sustained development.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"SMEs\" consistently. However, \"continued development\" is less idiomatic than \"sustained development.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. Also, \"continued development\" is less natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"its SME Coordination Mechanism,\" which is more natural. \"Small and medium-sized enterprises\" is more formal than \"SMEs,\" but both are acceptable. \"Continued development\" is still less idiomatic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"sustained development,\" which is more natural. However, \"coordination mechanism\" is lowercase, which is inconsistent with the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses the full name of the mechanism. \"Sustainable development\" is more natural than \"continued development.\" However, \"assist SMEs in obtaining\" is slightly wordy compared to \"help SMEs obtain.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use \"SMEs\" consistently for brevity.\n- Use \"sustained development\" for natural fluency.\n- Capitalize \"Coordination Mechanism\" to match the original text's formality.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced nine measures through its SME Coordination Mechanism in March to help SMEs obtain bank financing and support their sustained development.\n\nNine support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March  \nNine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March  \nThe nine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March.  \nThe nine measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March.  \nNine measures supporting small and medium-sized enterprises announced in March  \nThe nine measures announced in March to support small and medium-sized enterprises  \nReview:  \nThe translations are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and structure that affect fluency and naturalness in English. The first and second translations are concise and direct, but they lack the definite article \"the\" which is commonly used in English when referring to specific sets of measures. The third and fourth translations are identical and include \"the,\" which adds a slight sense of specificity, but the placement of \"to support\" after \"measures\" feels slightly awkward. The fifth translation uses \"supporting\" as a present participle, which is grammatically correct but less common in formal or official contexts. The sixth translation places \"announced in March\" after \"measures,\" which is more natural and flows better in English.\nReasoning:  \nTo produce the best possible translation, the structure should be natural and idiomatic in English. The use of \"the\" is appropriate when referring to specific measures. The phrase \"announced in March\" should be placed after \"measures\" for better flow. The verb \"to support\" should be used in its infinitive form to maintain clarity and formality.\nImproved Translation:  \nThe nine measures announced in March to support small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n1. The first junior translator's translation is grammatically correct and clear, but the phrasing \"Mortgage customers who make timely installment payments are not required to repay early\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise. The second part is accurate but could be more natural.\n2. The second junior translator's translation is more concise and natural, especially with \"No prepayment penalties for mortgage clients who make payments on time.\" However, the second sentence is slightly awkward with \"Loan limits will be adjusted, providing customers with a minimum six-month transition period.\"\n3. The third junior translator's translation is problematic. The phrase \"do not adhere to scheduled contributions\" is confusing and contradicts the original meaning. The second sentence is accurate but could be more natural.\n4. The fourth junior translator's translation misinterprets the original text. The phrase \"if they are unable to make timely payments\" is incorrect, as the original text does not mention inability to make payments.\n5. The fifth junior translator's translation is accurate but the first sentence is awkward with \"who do not make timely payments\" which contradicts the original meaning. The second sentence is accurate but could be more natural.\n6. The sixth junior translator's translation is the most accurate and natural. The first sentence is clear and concise, and the second sentence is also natural and accurate.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a combination of the strengths of the sixth junior translator's translation with some minor adjustments for clarity and naturalness.\nHere is the improved translation:\n1. Do not require mortgage customers who have made timely payments to repay early.\n2. Adjust credit limits to provide customers with a minimum of six months' transition period.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局於2024年在加強香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」的合資格抵押品範圍；優化「北向互換通」；以及優化一級流動性提供行安排。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強面向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」 策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」的登記數目及交易量繼續穩步增長，於2024年底達到1,580萬個登記，全年平均每日處理港元即時交易增至165萬宗。金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 概覽\n\n在2024年，金管局繼續致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n金管局擴展及優化香港與內地間的互聯互通機制，有助鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場間的橋樑角色。年內，多項有關「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）的優化措施出台，便利粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）個人投資者進行跨境投資。於2月，金管局將中華人民共和國財政部（國家財政部）發行的在岸國債和內地政策性銀行發行的政策性金融債納入人民幣流動資金安排的合資格抵押品名單。於7月，兩地相關部門公布進一步支持境外投資者使用通過「債券通」持有的在岸債券作為「北向互換通」交易的履約抵押品，並於2025年1月實施。此外，「北向互換通」於年內進行優化，增加投資者在對沖策略和管理投資組合方面的靈活性及效率。\n\n在2024年，香港的離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。金管局推出一級流動性提供行安排的優化措施，包括增加提供行數目及擴大安排規模。於年底前，香港人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力提升，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要。\n\n金管局推出大灣區金融合作下的多項利民便商措施，包括促進企業跨境融資的跨境徵信互通業務試點，以及便利香港居民在大灣區置業的跨境匯款支付安排。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港整體金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增強香港作為首選基金管理中心及家族辦公室業務樞紐的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，金管局透過Evergreen項目發行第二批代幣化債券，並推出「EvergreenHub」一站式數碼債券知識庫和「數碼債券資助計劃」，繼續推動香港債券市場創新。於10月，金管局公布「可持續金融行動計劃」，訂明進一步鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的具體目標。\n\n另一方面，金管局繼續加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。金管局在11月舉辦第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期三日，主題為「在變局中前航」，雲集全球各地金融業界翹楚分享各自獨到的觀點。峰會先由國務院副總理何立峰先生作開幕主題演講，接着是三間內地金融監管機構的分享環節，以及由國際金融領袖參與的專題討論。峰會共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的領袖參與，充分體現國際金融界對香港的支持和信心。\n\n年內金管局亦舉辦各項其他研討會及會議，包括：\n\n- 於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    - 開始探索以央行數碼貨幣支持香港代幣化市場的發展；\n- 透過「商業數據通」便利中小企借貸；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n「轉數快」的使用在2024年繼續增加，登記數目與交易量在過去六年穩步上升。截至2024年底，「轉數快」登記數目增至1,580萬個，全年每日平均交易宗數較上年上升33%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量持續增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監管15項持牌儲值支付工具（其中四項由持牌銀行發行）。年內金管局繼續與業界緊密合作，因應詐騙風險上升加強管控措施及保障消費者。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局就在香港實施穩定幣發行人監管制度的立法建議，於2月完成為期兩個月的公眾諮詢後，於7月聯合發表諮詢總結，並於12月將《穩定幣條例草案》提交立法會審議。為更了解穩定幣發行人的業務模式，並制定適切的監管制度，金管局亦推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，並於7月公布三間進入「沙盒」的參與機構。與此同時，金管局繼續積極參與國際組織在數碼資產相關課題（包括穩定幣及代幣化）的工作，確保相關監管框架符合國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n# 金管局於2024年就加強香港國際金融中心競爭力的措施一覽\n\n深化香港與內地金融市場互聯互通鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位及加強大灣區內的聯繫\n\n- 優化「跨境理財通」及「北向互換通」\n- 擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排和「北向互換通」的合資格抵押品範圍，納入國家財政部和內地政策性銀行發行的在岸人民幣債券\n- 優化一級流動性提供行安排\n- 提升香港的人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要\n- 為深圳市政府、廣東省政府及海南省政府在香港發行點心債提供支持\n- 通過跨境徵信互通合作，便利企業跨境融資\n- 實施大灣區置業的跨境匯款便利化措施\n- 加深內地相關機構與香港金融業的交流及溝通，開拓商機\n\n# 加強與全球各地的聯繫\n\n- 舉辦連串國際盛事：「國際金融領袖投資峰會」、金融穩定理事會全體會議，以及與國際結算銀行合辦研討會\n- 加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務，並奠下與中東及東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）地區合作的堅實基礎\n- 積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織\n\n# 提升金融平台競爭力\n\n- 透過Evergreen項目推動債券市場創新，包括協助政府發行全球首批多幣種數碼債券啟動一站式數碼債券知識庫「EvergreenHub ，並且推出「數碼債券資助計劃\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the tone of official announcements or reports. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning of the sentence, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and structure that affect fluency and clarity.\nTranslation 1 uses \"strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial centre.\" The phrasing is natural and accurate, with \"globally competitive\" being a precise match for the original Chinese. However, the placement of \"in 2024\" at the beginning of the sentence may slightly disrupt the flow.\nTranslation 2 uses \"enhancing\" instead of \"strengthening\" and \"internationally competitive\" instead of \"globally competitive.\" While \"enhancing\" is a valid synonym, \"strengthening\" is more commonly used in formal contexts related to economic or financial positions. \"Internationally competitive\" is slightly less precise than \"globally competitive,\" as the original emphasizes a global, not just international, scope.\nTranslation 3 places \"in 2024\" at the end of the sentence, which is grammatically correct but less common in formal writing. It also uses \"strengthening\" and \"globally competitive,\" which are accurate.\nTranslations 4, 5, and 6 are nearly identical, with only minor differences in word order. All use \"strengthening\" and \"globally competitive,\" which are the most accurate choices. However, the placement of \"in 2024\" at the beginning of the sentence in translations 4, 6, and 5 is slightly less fluid than placing it at the end, as seen in translation 3.\nThe best approach would be to use \"strengthening\" for consistency with formal financial terminology, \"globally competitive\" to accurately reflect the original's emphasis on global competition, and to place \"in 2024\" at the end of the sentence for a more natural and formal flow.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority made significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a globally competitive international financial center in 2024.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and terminology consistency. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the main actor and mention its collaboration with mainland and Hong Kong authorities.\n- Most translations accurately convey the purpose of the measures: to deepen and expand financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland.\n- The key initiatives—such as optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" expanding eligible collateral, and improving liquidity arrangements—are generally well translated.\n- The final sentence about strengthening Hong Kong’s role as a gateway and offshore RMB hub is consistently rendered across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the translation of specific programs. For example, \"粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通\" is translated as \"Greater Bay Area Cross-Boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-Border Wealth Management Link,\" or \"Cross-border Financial Services Platform for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\" The most accurate and commonly used term is \"Greater Bay Area Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- **\"Southbound Trading Link\" vs. \"Northbound Swap Connect\":** One translation incorrectly refers to \"Southbound Trading Link\" instead of \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" which is a critical error in terminology.\n- **\"Liquidity Provider Arrangement\" vs. \"Liquidity Facility\":** Some translations use \"liquidity provider arrangement,\" while others use \"liquidity facility.\" The term \"liquidity facility\" is more precise in the context of the HKMA’s operations.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly more verbose or awkward in phrasing, such as \"refining the primary liquidity providing arrangement\" or \"improving the arrangements for primary liquidity providers.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the most accurate and commonly accepted English names for the financial programs, such as \"Greater Bay Area Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\n- Maintain consistency in terminology, especially for terms like \"liquidity facility\" and \"liquidity provider arrangement.\"\n- Ensure the translation is fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal or awkward phrasing.\n- Ensure that the final sentence clearly emphasizes Hong Kong’s role as a global offshore RMB hub.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with relevant mainland and Hong Kong authorities to implement a series of measures aimed at deepening and expanding the connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets. These include optimizing the \"Greater Bay Area Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\"; expanding the eligible collateral scope for the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facility and the \"Northbound Swap Connect\"; optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Connect\"; and improving the primary liquidity provider arrangement. These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong’s gateway role and consolidate its position as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its role in strengthening Hong Kong's financial platform.\n- The key areas covered—bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centers—are consistently translated.\n- The mention of the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and the \"ripple effect\" is accurately rendered in all versions.\n- The role of the HKMA in global financial stability and market development is clearly conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive phrasing, such as \"intensified its market promotion efforts\" or \"ensuring a full understanding,\" which can be made more natural.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The use of \"market promotion\" instead of \"marketing\" or \"publicity\" may not be the most idiomatic in this context. Similarly, \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" is slightly awkward compared to \"central banks and regulatory bodies.\"\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"financial platform\" while others use \"financial hub,\" which may reflect different interpretations of the original term. \"Financial hub\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and may be more appropriate.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Mainland China\" is used in some translations, which is acceptable but \"Mainland stakeholders\" is more concise and commonly used in official contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements can be made:\n- Use \"financial hub\" instead of \"financial platform\" for better alignment with common financial terminology.\n- Replace \"market promotion\" with \"marketing\" or \"publicity\" for a more natural tone.\n- Use \"regulatory bodies\" instead of \"regulatory organizations\" for consistency with official terminology.\n- Ensure consistent use of terms like \"Mainland stakeholders\" or \"overseas and mainland stakeholders\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use more idiomatic expressions such as \"helping stakeholders fully understand\" instead of \"ensuring a full understanding.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as a financial hub, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centers. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its marketing efforts targeting overseas and mainland stakeholders, helping them fully understand the robustness of Hong Kong's financial system and the opportunities it offers. The successful holding of the third \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and other major events not only enhanced Hong Kong's image as a leading international financial center but also created a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory bodies, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market development.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, highlighting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) achievements in the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, specifically in the areas of central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and terminology that affect fluency and accuracy.\nTranslation 1 uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in contexts where the reader is expected to know the acronym. However, in formal or public-facing communication, it is often preferable to spell out the full name first before using the abbreviation.\nTranslation 2 uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and is grammatically correct. The preposition \"under\" is slightly less precise than \"across\" or \"in\" when referring to areas of a strategy.\nTranslation 3 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is not the correct name for the HKMA. This is a critical error in terminology and should be avoided.\nTranslation 4 is accurate and uses the full name of the authority, with the preposition \"across\" and the possessive \"its\" to indicate ownership of the strategy. This is a strong translation.\nTranslation 5 is similar to Translation 4 but uses \"in all areas\" instead of \"across all areas.\" Both are correct, but \"across\" may be slightly more natural in this context.\nTranslation 6 is nearly identical to Translation 4, with the only difference being the use of \"various areas\" instead of \"all areas.\" While both are acceptable, \"across all areas\" may be more precise in conveying comprehensive progress.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use the full name of the authority, the preposition \"across,\" and the possessive \"its\" to indicate the strategy belongs to the HKMA. It should also use \"all areas\" to emphasize the breadth of progress.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress across all areas of its \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core information of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key figures: 15.8 million registrations and 1.65 million daily transactions.\n- Most translations use \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) or its full name, which is appropriate for clarity.\n- The mention of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China is consistent across translations.\n- The goal of enabling cross-border payments is clearly conveyed in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Faster Payment\" or \"Zhuanshu Kuai\" without explanation, while others use \"FPS\" with parentheses. The most consistent and professional approach is to use \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) with the Chinese name in parentheses on first mention.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the average daily processing of HKD instant transactions increasing to 1.65 million\" or \"the average daily number of real-time Hong Kong dollar transactions processed throughout the year increasing to 1.65 million.\" These are grammatically correct but lack fluency.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Zhuanshu Kuai\" is not commonly used in English contexts; it is better to use the official English name \"FPS\" or \"Fast Payment System\" for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"aiming to achieve cross-border payment capabilities\" or \"facilitating cross-border payments,\" which can be simplified to \"enabling cross-border payments.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) consistently with the Chinese name in parentheses on first mention.\n- Simplify and streamline sentence structures for better fluency.\n- Ensure that the term \"cross-border payments\" is used consistently and clearly.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary phrasing.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe number of registrations and transaction volume for the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) continue to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024, with the average daily processing of Hong Kong dollar instant transactions increasing to 1.65 million. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with the People's Bank of China to promote the implementation of interconnection between Hong Kong's FPS and the mainland's cross-bank clearing system for online payments, enabling cross-border payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to strive to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology consistency. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the purpose of expanding and optimizing connectivity mechanisms.\n- Most translations correctly reference the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" or similar terms, though there is variation in the exact name used.\n- The key events (February and July announcements) are all accurately translated, with the correct mention of the RMB Liquidity Arrangement and the Northbound Swap Connect.\n- The overall structure of the sentences is logical and follows the chronological order of the events described.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the translation of specific programs, such as \"粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通\" (Cross-border Wealth Management Connect), which is sometimes translated as \"Cross-border Financial Services,\" \"Cross-border Investment Channel,\" or \"Wealth Management Connect.\" This can confuse readers unfamiliar with the exact program names.\n- **Incorrect Program Names:** One translation incorrectly refers to \"Southbound Trading Connect\" instead of \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" which is a critical error.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"facilitating cross-border investments for individual investors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (the Greater Bay Area),\" which is redundant and could be more concise.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Mainland\" is used inconsistently, sometimes as \"Mainland China\" and sometimes as \"the Mainland.\" While not incorrect, it is better to maintain consistency for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the official English name for the program, \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect,\" to ensure clarity and consistency.\n- Ensure that the term \"Northbound Swap Connect\" is used consistently and correctly, avoiding any mislabeling.\n- Maintain consistent terminology for \"Mainland China\" or \"the Mainland\" throughout the translation.\n- Improve sentence fluency by avoiding redundancy and ensuring that the structure is natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded and optimized the interconnected mechanisms between Hong Kong and mainland China, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a bridge between the mainland and international financial markets. This year, several optimization measures related to the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" under the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) were introduced, facilitating cross-border investments for individual investors in the GBA. In February, the HKMA included onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China (State Ministry of Finance) and policy financial bonds issued by mainland China's policy banks in the eligible collateral list of the RMB Liquidity Arrangement. In July, relevant authorities on both sides announced further support for overseas investors to use onshore bonds held through the \"Bond Connect\" as collateral for transactions under the \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" which will be implemented in January 2025. Additionally, the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" was optimized during the year, enhancing investors' flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and portfolio management.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's offshore RMB business experienced steady growth. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced optimized measures for the Primary Liquidity Provision Arrangement, including increasing the number of participating institutions and expanding the scale of the arrangement. By the end of the year, the nighttime cross-border service capabilities of Hong Kong's RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System were enhanced to better meet the growing global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) introduction of measures under the Greater Bay Area (GBA) financial cooperation framework. These measures include a pilot program for cross-border credit information sharing and cross-border remittance arrangements to facilitate property purchases by Hong Kong residents in the GBA.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the two main initiatives.\n- The use of terms like \"cross-border credit information sharing\" and \"cross-border remittance arrangements\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less precise and could be confusing.\n- The phrase \"people-friendly and business-convenient\" in the first translation is somewhat awkward and less idiomatic than alternatives like \"benefiting the public and facilitating business.\"\n- The use of \"corporate financing\" in the fourth translation is slightly less precise than \"enterprise financing\" or \"cross-border financing for enterprises.\"\n- Some translations use \"facilitate\" and \"make it easier\" interchangeably, which, while not incorrect, lacks variety and could be improved for stylistic clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Opt for more idiomatic expressions such as \"benefiting the public and facilitating business\" or \"people-friendly and business-convenient\" depending on the desired tone.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, such as using \"cross-border financing for enterprises\" rather than \"corporate financing.\"\n- Vary the use of verbs like \"facilitate\" and \"promote\" to enhance readability and avoid repetition.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, precision, and fluency while using natural English expressions and consistent terminology.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced a series of measures benefiting the public and facilitating business under the Greater Bay Area financial cooperation framework, including a pilot program for cross-border credit information sharing to promote cross-border financing for enterprises, as well as cross-border remittance arrangements to facilitate property purchases by Hong Kong residents in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey its ongoing efforts to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform.\n- The key initiatives—such as the Evergreen project, the issuance of tokenized bonds, the launch of EvergreenHub, and the Digital Bond Funding Scheme—are all present in each version.\n- The mention of the \"Sustainable Finance Action Plan\" and its goal to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance is consistently translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary and Terminology:** Some translations use slightly inconsistent or less precise terms. For example, \"convenient tax and regulatory environment\" (used in translations 1 and 6) is less formal than \"favorable\" or \"facilitative,\" which are more commonly used in official or policy-related contexts. Similarly, \"Digital Bond Funding Program\" (translation 1) and \"Digital Bond Grant Scheme\" (translations 2, 3, 5, 6) are variations of the same concept, but \"Grant Scheme\" may be more appropriate if the initiative involves financial support.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly more verbose or repetitive. For instance, translations 1 and 4 use \"continues to drive innovation in Hong Kong's bond market\" twice, which can be streamlined.\n- **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness:** The use of \"Authority\" (translations 2, 5) is acceptable, but \"HKMA\" is more precise and consistent with official references.\n- **Consistency in Project Names:** \"Evergreen project\" (translations 1, 2, 4, 5) and \"Evergreen initiative\" (translation 4) should be standardized as \"Evergreen project\" for consistency.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"favorable\" or \"facilitative\" instead of \"convenient\" when describing the tax and regulatory environment.\n- Standardize the name of the project as \"Evergreen project\" throughout.\n- Use \"Digital Bond Grant Scheme\" if the initiative involves financial support, or \"Digital Bond Funding Program\" if it is more general.\n- Ensure consistency in referring to the HKMA as \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"the HKMA\" depending on context.\n- Streamline repetitive phrases to enhance fluency and readability.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to enhancing the overall competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management center and a hub for family office business, the HKMA is working closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In addition, through the Evergreen project, the HKMA has issued the second batch of tokenized bonds and launched EvergreenHub, a one-stop digital bond knowledge base, and the Digital Bond Grant Scheme, continuing to promote innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market. In October, the HKMA announced the “Sustainable Finance Action Plan,” outlining specific goals to further solidify Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen its market expansion efforts, introducing Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. In November, the HKMA hosted the third edition of the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit, themed \"Sailing Ahead in a Changing Landscape,\" brought together leading figures from the global financial industry to share their unique insights. The summit commenced with a keynote speech by Vice Premier He Lifeng of the State Council, followed by presentations from three mainland financial regulatory bodies and panel discussions featuring international financial leaders. A total of over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions participated, fully demonstrating the international financial community's support for and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority also held various other seminars and meetings throughout the year, including:\n\n- Co-hosted a joint climate finance conference with the Dubai Financial Services Authority in September;  \n- Co-hosted the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Global Association of Risk Professionals in October;  \n- Also co-hosted an International Financial Seminar with the Bank for International Settlements in October; and  \n- Hosted the Financial Stability Board plenary meeting in December, the first such meeting held in Asia since 2016, bringing together leaders and senior officials from over 50 national financial authorities and 12 international standard-setting bodies.\n\nThis year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively strengthened its bilateral ties with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE Central Bank) and the Saudi Central Bank, aiming to promote investment and financial market linkages between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed a memorandum of understanding with the UAE Central Bank to establish interoperability between the debt capital market infrastructures of the two regions and to facilitate cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to enhance cooperation in the financial services sector between the two regions.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held the seventh Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue in December, discussing regional and local outlooks and policy challenges, as well as the latest developments and potential areas for cooperation in sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the timeline (January and May) and the countries visited (Thailand and Malaysia).\n- The key message of promoting Hong Kong as an international financial center and strengthening bilateral financial ties is consistently maintained.\n- The use of terms like \"central banks,\" \"financial institutions,\" and \"enterprises\/companies\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n- The mention of promoting the use of the RMB and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlement is accurately rendered in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Respectively\" placement:** Some translations place \"respectively\" after \"January and May,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluid than placing it after \"Thailand and Malaysia.\"\n- **\"Status\" vs. \"position\":** While both are acceptable, \"status\" is more commonly used in formal contexts when referring to a country's standing in the global financial system.\n- **\"Focus on\" vs. \"area of focus\":** The phrase \"one of the key areas of focus was promoting...\" is slightly more natural than \"one of the key areas focused on was promoting...\"\n- **\"Investments\" vs. \"investment\":** The singular form \"investment\" is more standard in formal writing unless referring to multiple distinct investments.\n- **\"Settlements\" vs. \"settlement\":** The singular form \"settlement\" is more commonly used in financial contexts when referring to the process of settling trade or investment transactions.\n- **\"Companies\" vs. \"enterprises\":** While both are acceptable, \"enterprises\" may sound slightly more formal or bureaucratic than \"companies,\" which is more commonly used in international financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"status\" instead of \"position\" for a more formal tone.\n- Place \"respectively\" after \"Thailand and Malaysia\" for smoother flow.\n- Use \"investment\" and \"settlement\" in the singular form for consistency with standard financial terminology.\n- Use \"companies\" instead of \"enterprises\" for a more natural and widely understood term.\n- Use \"one of the key areas of focus was promoting...\" for better grammatical flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) visited Thailand and Malaysia in January and May respectively, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and companies to promote Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and further strengthen bilateral financial ties and cooperation. One of the key areas of focus was promoting the use of the RMB and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as highlighting Hong Kong's competitive advantages.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking matters and continues to play a leading role in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Asia Regional Consultative Group under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and also as co-chair of the FSB’s Financial Innovation Network (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the Governors’ Meeting of Major Emerging Market Economies under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Peer Review Group on Crypto-Asset Frameworks under the FSB. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA has continuously served as chair of the Financial Market Work Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech-related office and its collaboration with banking departments.\n- The \"Fintech 2025\" strategy is consistently mentioned, and the goal of enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub is well captured.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the main clause followed by a list of initiatives.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the name of the office. Some use \"Fintech Promotion Office,\" others use \"Fintech Facilitation Office,\" and one uses \"Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for Financial Technology Promotion.\" The original text uses “金融科技促進辦公室,” which translates most accurately to “Fintech Promotion Office.”\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use “financial technology” instead of the more concise “fintech,” which is standard in English financial discourse. Also, the phrase “Key initiatives to be rolled out this year include” is slightly less natural than “Key measures implemented this year include.”\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term “Asia’s fintech hub” is used in several translations, which is appropriate, but “leading fintech hub in Asia” is slightly more formal and precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the most accurate and consistent terminology for the office, based on the original Chinese.\n- Use “fintech” consistently instead of “financial technology” for brevity and fluency.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is natural and concise, avoiding overly formal or awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain a balance between accuracy and readability, ensuring that the translation reflects the original intent while sounding natural in English.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Promotion Office continues to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy in collaboration with various banking departments, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s leading fintech hub. Key measures implemented this year include:\n\n- Further promote the application of fintech in five key areas by banks, including wealth technology, insurance technology, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology;\n- Advance work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) to understand its benefits and potential application scenarios, including:\n    - Advancing the \"Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Cross-border Network\" (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments;\n    - Further studying the feasibility of issuing a \"digital Hong Kong dollar\" (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; and\n    - Beginning to explore the use of CBDC to support the development of Hong Kong's tokenized markets;\n- Facilitate lending for small and medium-sized enterprises through the \"Commercial Data Link\";\n- Strengthen cross-border fintech collaboration; and\n- Promote wider use of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and grammatical precision that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points: the increase in \"轉數快\" usage, the 15.8 million registrations, the 33% rise in daily transactions, and the growth drivers.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and transactional terminology, such as \"stored-value payment tools\" and \"e-wallets.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term \"轉數快\" is translated differently across translations, including \"Faster Payments,\" \"FPS,\" \"Fast Payment System,\" \"Fast Transfer,\" and even the literal \"Zhuanshu Kuai.\" This inconsistency may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. The most appropriate and commonly used term in English financial contexts is \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System), which should be used consistently with an explanation in parentheses on first mention.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations have minor grammatical issues, such as \"are the main drivers\" (should be \"are the main drivers\") and \"the continued increase in using FPS to pay government bills...\" which is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"the continued use of FPS to pay government bills...\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"value-added services\" in the sixth translation is not appropriate in this context. The original refers to \"增值\" in the context of topping up e-wallets or bank accounts, which should be translated as \"top up\" or \"recharge,\" not \"value-added services.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) consistently with an explanation in parentheses on first mention.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and fluency, particularly in verb usage and sentence structure.\n- Avoid literal translations of terms like \"Zhuanshu Kuai\" and instead use the established English term.\n- Replace \"value-added services\" with \"top up\" or \"recharge\" when referring to e-wallets or bank accounts.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"FPS\" consistently, maintain grammatical accuracy, and ensure clarity and fluency in conveying the growth and usage of the system.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe use of FPS (Fast Payment System) continued to grow in 2024, with registration numbers and transaction volumes showing steady growth over the past six years. As of the end of 2024, FPS registrations reached 15.8 million, with the average daily transaction volume for the year increasing by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments and business payments, the continued use of FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts used for stored-value payment tools has been the main driver behind the sustained growth in FPS transaction volumes.\n\nTo ensure the security and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 15 licensed stored value payment facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to work closely with the industry to enhance control measures and protect consumers in response to the rising risk of fraud.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (e.g., Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Legislative Council).\n- The timeline of events (February consultation, July summary, December submission) is consistently maintained across translations.\n- The concept of a \"sandbox\" for stablecoin issuers is accurately translated, with most using the term \"regulatory sandbox.\"\n- The mention of international organizations and alignment with international standards is well preserved.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau,\" while others use \"Financial Secretary's Department.\" The correct official name is \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\"\n- **Legislative Terminology:** The term \"Stablecoin Bill\" is used in some translations, while others use \"Stablecoin Ordinance Draft\" or \"Draft Stablecoin Ordinance.\" The correct term in Hong Kong legislative context is \"Stablecoin Ordinance.\"\n- **Fluency and Structure:** Some translations are more verbose or awkwardly structured, such as \"the relevant regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices\" (repeated in multiple translations), which can be streamlined.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"deliberation\" is used in some translations, but \"consideration\" or \"review\" may be more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the official name \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\"\n- Use the correct legislative term \"Stablecoin Ordinance.\"\n- Ensure consistent and natural phrasing, avoiding repetition and awkward structures.\n- Maintain clarity and fluency while preserving the formal tone appropriate for regulatory and governmental texts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFollowing a two-month public consultation on legislative proposals for implementing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong, completed in February, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly released a consultation summary in July. In December, they submitted the \"Stablecoin Ordinance\" to the Legislative Council for consideration. To better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and establish appropriate regulatory frameworks, the HKMA also launched a \"sandbox\" for stablecoin issuers and announced three participating institutions that had entered the sandbox in July. At the same time, the HKMA continues to actively engage with international organizations on issues related to digital assets, including stablecoins and tokenization, ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Overview of Measures by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2024 to Enhance Hong Kong’s Competitiveness as an International Financial Centre\n\nDeepening the connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets strengthens Hong Kong's position as an offshore RMB business hub and enhances integration within the Greater Bay Area.\n\n- Optimize the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Link\" and the \"Northbound Swap Connect\"  \n- Expand the eligible collateral scope for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's RMB liquidity arrangements and the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of China and mainland policy banks  \n- Optimize the primary liquidity provider arrangement  \n- Enhance the nighttime cross-border service capability of Hong Kong's RMB real-time payment and settlement system to better meet the global demand for cross-border RMB payments  \n- Support the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government in issuing dim sum bonds in Hong Kong  \n- Facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-border credit information interoperability cooperation  \n- Implement measures to facilitate cross-border remittances for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area  \n- Deepen exchanges and communication between relevant mainland institutions and Hong Kong's financial sector to explore business opportunities\n\n# Strengthening Global Connections\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text, “加強與全球各地的聯繫,” translates to \"Strengthening connections with all parts of the world.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\n1. **\"Strengthening Connections Around the World\"** – This is fluent and natural, but \"around the world\" is slightly less precise than \"globally\" or \"across the globe\" in conveying the idea of global reach.\n2. **\"Strengthening Connections with the World\"** – This is concise but slightly vague. \"The world\" is a broad term and may not fully capture the nuance of \"global各地\" (all parts of the world).\n3. **\"Strengthening Global Connections\"** – This is concise and impactful, but it omits the idea of \"with all parts of the world,\" which is central to the original phrase.\n4. **\"Strengthening Connections with People Around the World\"** – This is more specific than necessary, as the original does not explicitly mention \"people.\" It adds an element not present in the source text.\n5. **\"Strengthen connections with the world.\"** – This is grammatically correct but lacks the formal tone that might be expected in a title or heading.\n6. **\"Strengthening Connections Across the Globe\"** – This is a strong option, as \"across the globe\" is a common and natural expression that conveys global reach effectively.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and faithful to the original meaning. It should capture the idea of strengthening connections with all parts of the world without adding or omitting unnecessary elements. \"Strengthening Global Connections\" is concise but lacks the nuance of \"all parts of the world.\" \"Strengthening Connections Across the Globe\" is more vivid and natural but may be slightly more verbose than needed. A balanced approach would be to use \"Strengthening Global Connections\" as a base and enhance it with a more precise prepositional phrase.\n**Final Translation:**\n# Strengthening Connections Across the Globe\n\n- Host a series of international events, including the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" the plenary meeting of the Financial Stability Board, and a seminar co-organized with the Bank for International Settlements.  \n- Strengthen market expansion efforts by promoting Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders, and lay a solid foundation for cooperation with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \n- Actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations.\n\n# Enhancing the Competitiveness of Financial Platforms\n\nThrough the Evergreen Project, we are driving innovation in the bond market, including assisting the government in issuing the world’s first multi-currency digital bonds, launching the one-stop digital bond knowledge hub “EvergreenHub,” and introducing the “Digital Bond Grant Scheme.”\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2024年）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main points: the performance of global financial markets in 2024, stable economic growth, declining inflation, central banks lowering interest rates, and the Exchange Fund's investment returns.\n- The use of terms like \"policy interest rates,\" \"investment income,\" and \"return on investment\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"performed generally well\" while others use \"performed well\" or \"was generally positive.\" While all are acceptable, \"performed generally well\" is more consistent with the original Chinese, which uses “大致良好.”\n- **Use of \"successively\" vs. \"gradually\":** The original Chinese uses “陸續,” which implies a gradual or sequential process. \"Gradually\" is more accurate than \"successively,\" which suggests a more abrupt or stepwise process.\n- **\"Exchange Fund\" vs. \"Foreign Exchange Fund\":** The original Chinese refers to “外匯基金,” which is more accurately translated as \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" rather than \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- **Currency formatting:** Some translations use \"HK$218.8 billion\" while others use \"HKD 218.8 billion.\" The former is more commonly used in financial contexts and is more concise.\n- **\"Investment return rate\" vs. \"return on investment\":** \"Return on investment\" is a more standard financial term and is more natural in English.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"performed generally well\" to align with the original Chinese.\n- Use \"gradually\" to reflect the sequential and gradual nature of the central banks' actions.\n- Use \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"HK$218.8 billion\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"return on investment\" for standard financial terminology.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate these refinements to ensure clarity, consistency, and natural fluency in English.\nThe global financial markets performed generally well in 2024. Major economies recorded stable growth, while inflation declined to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks gradually lowered policy interest rates, creating a favorable investment environment. For the full year of 2024, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a return on investment of 5.2%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of the delegation by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the official nature of the subject matter. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the original's tone.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and concise, using \"Exchange Fund\" consistently. However, it omits the full name of the committee, which may be important in an official context.\nTranslation 2 uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" consistently and correctly, but the verb \"sets\" is less formal than \"establishes\" or \"determines,\" which may not match the tone of an official document.\nTranslation 3 uses \"shall determine,\" which is more formal and legalistic, but the use of \"shall\" may be overly rigid for modern English usage in this context.\nTranslation 4 is very similar to Translation 2, with the same use of \"sets\" and repetition of \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\nTranslation 5 adds the full name of the authority, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's,\" which may be unnecessary unless the context requires it. It also uses \"establishes,\" which is more formal and appropriate for an official document.\nTranslation 6 is identical to Translation 2 and suffers from the same issues.\nConsidering these points, the best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise terminology, and avoid redundancy. It should also use a verb that reflects the official and authoritative nature of the committee's role.\nThe improved translation should use \"establishes\" to reflect the formal establishment of investment objectives, and it should use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" consistently, as the full name is often used in official documents.\nThe final translation should be:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Safeguard capital;  \n(ii) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(iii) Ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(iv) Strive to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing that the objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and asset allocation, with a reference to Figure 1.\n**Review of the translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. \"Fully consider\" is appropriate, and the reference to \"Figure 1\" is correctly placed. However, \"portfolio structure\" may be slightly less precise than \"portfolio framework\" or \"portfolio composition.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"comprehensively address,\" which is slightly more formal and precise than \"fully consider.\" The phrase \"portfolio framework\" is more abstract than \"portfolio structure,\" but it is still acceptable. The inclusion of \"as illustrated in Figure 1\" is slightly more elaborate than necessary but not incorrect.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and clear. The repetition of \"the Exchange Fund\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect. The phrase \"take into account\" is slightly more formal than \"consider.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a very concise and accurate translation. \"Comprehensively consider\" is a strong and precise choice. The sentence is clean and direct, with no unnecessary repetition.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the third translation. The repetition of \"the Exchange Fund\" is slightly redundant, but the sentence is otherwise clear and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most precise and formal of the translations. \"Comprehensively take into account\" is a strong and accurate phrasing. The repetition of \"the Exchange Fund\" is slightly redundant, but the sentence is otherwise well-structured and clear.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English. It should avoid unnecessary repetition and use precise terminology. \"Comprehensively consider\" is more formal and precise than \"fully consider\" or \"take into account.\" \"Portfolio structure\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"portfolio framework.\" The reference to \"Figure 1\" should be concise and not overly elaborated.\n**Improved translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent in meaning. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that can be refined for clarity and fluency.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations are nearly identical, with slight variations in punctuation (e.g., space before the colon). The third translation uses an apostrophe in \"Fund’s,\" which is grammatically correct but less commonly used in formal or institutional contexts. The fifth translation, \"Investment Portfolio Categories of the Exchange Fund,\" reorders the phrase, which may be less intuitive for readers expecting the fund's name to precede its portfolio categories.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain consistency with standard institutional naming conventions. \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is the full and formal name, and it should be used in preference to \"Exchange Fund\" unless the latter is an established abbreviation. Additionally, the phrase \"Investment Portfolio Categories\" is more naturally ordered as \"Categories of the Investment Portfolio\" when referring to a classification system.\nTherefore, the most fluent and natural translation would be: \"Figure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio.\" This version maintains clarity, adheres to standard phrasing, and is consistent with formal English usage.\n\nThe original text discusses the structure and purpose of the Exchange Fund, emphasizing its division into two portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. Each translation captures the general meaning, but there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision.\n**Translation 1** is clear and fluent, using \"money supply\" and \"full backing,\" which are appropriate. However, \"money supply\" may not be the most precise term in this context; \"monetary base\" is more commonly used in central banking terminology.\n**Translation 2** uses \"currency base\" and \"safeguard the value of assets,\" which are accurate. It also includes the full name of OECD with the acronym in parentheses, which is good for clarity. However, \"primarily invests\" is slightly less direct than \"mainly invests.\"\n**Translation 3** is well-structured and uses \"monetary base\" and \"provisions of the currency board system,\" which are precise. It also uses \"debt and equity markets\" instead of \"bond and stock markets,\" which is more formal and appropriate for financial contexts. However, \"with the aim of preserving\" is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 4** uses \"monetary authority system\" instead of \"currency board system,\" which is a misinterpretation. It also uses \"ample backing\" instead of \"full support,\" which is less precise. The phrase \"as stipulated by\" is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 5** uses \"currency issuance regime\" instead of \"currency board system,\" which is a less common term and may confuse readers. It also uses \"ensure the value and long-term purchasing power of assets,\" which is slightly less natural than \"preserve the value and maintain long-term purchasing power.\"\n**Translation 6** is very close to the best version, using \"monetary base\" and \"currency issuance system.\" However, \"currency issuance system\" is not the standard term; \"currency board system\" is more accurate. It also uses \"ensure the value of assets and long-term purchasing power,\" which is slightly less fluid than \"preserve the value and maintain long-term purchasing power.\"\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"monetary base\" instead of \"money supply\" or \"currency base\" for precision.\n- Use \"currency board system\" instead of \"currency issuance system\" or \"monetary authority system.\"\n- Use \"preserve the value and maintain long-term purchasing power\" for fluency and clarity.\n- Use \"debt and equity markets\" instead of \"bond and stock markets\" for formality and accuracy.\n- Include the full name of OECD with the acronym in parentheses for clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member economies, with the aim of preserving the value and maintaining the long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, as well as the allocation for other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a strategy for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe original text discusses the Foreign Exchange Fund's acceptance of deposits and the specific interest rate arrangements for the Future Fund, which is tied to the returns of two investment portfolios. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is clear and accurate, but uses \"future fund\" in lowercase, which may not be ideal if it's a proper noun. It also uses \"the Future Fund is a primary example,\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 2** uses \"major exception\" instead of \"example,\" which changes the nuance slightly. It also uses \"was\" for the 2024 allocation, which may be outdated if the text refers to a current or ongoing target.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"in the case of the Future Fund, which is a major individual example,\" which is unnecessarily wordy.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the best version, using \"notable exception\" and \"determined based on actual asset allocation.\" It also uses \"within the Future Fund\" for clarity.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Fiscal Reserves\" and \"Government Funds\" with capitalization, which may be appropriate if they are official names. It also uses \"account for approximately 35:65 of Future Fund’s target asset allocation,\" which is slightly awkward phrasing.\n**Translation 6** uses \"from time to time\" instead of \"occasionally,\" which is a minor variation. It also uses \"represents a key individual example,\" which is slightly more formal and precise.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" consistently if it's the official name.\n- Use \"Future Fund\" with a capital \"F\" if it's a proper noun.\n- Use \"notable exception\" or \"key example\" depending on the intended nuance.\n- Use \"target asset allocation\" consistently and clearly.\n- Use present tense for the 2024 allocation if it's still current.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception, as its deposit rates are linked to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with interest rates determined based on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio within the Future Fund was approximately 35:65.\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception, as its deposit rates are linked to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with interest rates determined based on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio within the Future Fund was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and consistency that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the two types of asset allocation: strategic and tactical.\n- The concept of \"benchmark allocation\" and \"tracking error limits\" is consistently translated.\n- The role of the Financial Secretary and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accurately reflected in most translations.\n- The idea of \"strategic deviation\" is captured, though with some variation in terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is confusion between \"strategic deviation\" and \"tactical deviation.\" The original text clearly refers to \"strategic deviation\" as the difference between actual and benchmark allocation. However, translations 1, 2, 6 use \"tactical deviation,\" while translations 3, 4, 5 use \"strategic deviation.\" This is a critical error, as the term \"strategic deviation\" is not standard in finance; the correct term is \"tactical deviation.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"the difference between the actual allocation and the benchmark allocation is referred to as 'tactical deviation'\" (translation 3), which is grammatically correct but could be more concise.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Exchange Fund\" is correctly used, and the reference to the \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is appropriate for the context of Hong Kong.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"strategic deviation\" is not standard in financial terminology. The correct term is \"tactical deviation,\" which refers to the deviation from the strategic (benchmark) allocation.\n- The phrase \"the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as 'tactical deviation'\" should be used consistently.\n- The sentence structure can be refined for greater fluency and clarity, particularly in the explanation of the roles of the Financial Secretary and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is expressed in terms of an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and permissible tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the allowable range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the allowable range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe original text describes the responsibilities of the Exchange Fund Investment Office under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), emphasizing its role in managing a significant portion of the Exchange Fund's investments and implementing risk management strategies.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology. However, it uses \"support portfolio\" which may not be the most precise term in this context. Also, \"implement\" is slightly less formal than \"execute\" in financial contexts.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" consistently and \"supporting portfolio\" is more natural than \"support portfolio.\" The use of \"executes\" is appropriate for financial strategies.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate but omits \"Exchange Fund\" in the second sentence, which could cause confusion. It also uses \"supporting portfolio\" but lacks the full name \"Exchange Fund\" in some instances, which may be less precise.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and consistent. It uses \"support portfolio\" and \"executes\" appropriately. However, it repeats \"Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily in the second sentence, which could be streamlined.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is very similar to the fourth, with the same strengths and minor repetition. It uses \"executes\" and \"global fixed-income market\" correctly.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation has several issues. It incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"foreign exchange fund\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the proper noun \"Exchange Fund.\" The term \"macroeconomic risk management\" is less precise than \"macro risk management\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct full name of the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use the proper noun \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Use precise financial terminology such as \"supporting portfolio\" and \"executes.\"\n- Avoid unnecessary repetition.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for financial documentation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff are directly responsible for managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This internally managed portion of the investment portfolio includes investments in the global fixed-income market and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through various derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 外聘投資經理,\" which translates to \"External Investment Manager\" in English. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, with minor variations in punctuation and plurality.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify \"外聘投資經理\" as \"External Investment Manager,\" which is the most direct and accurate translation.\n- The use of the term \"External\" is appropriate, as it conveys the idea of someone hired from outside the organization, which aligns with the meaning of \"外聘.\"\nWeaknesses:\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations (e.g., Translation 3 and 4) is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement or heading structure. Since the original text includes the \"#\", it may be intended as a heading or label, but in standard English usage, it is not typically included in job titles unless specified.\n- Translation 4 uses the plural form \"External Investment Managers,\" which may not be appropriate unless the context clearly indicates that multiple individuals are being referred to. The original text uses the singular form \"經理,\" so the singular is more accurate unless otherwise specified.\nImprovements:\n- The best translation should retain the accuracy of \"External Investment Manager\" while removing the unnecessary \"#\" symbol unless it is required for formatting.\n- The singular form is more appropriate unless the context clearly indicates a plural.\nBased on this reasoning, the most accurate and natural translation is \"External Investment Manager.\"\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset categories. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the Exchange Fund, achieve sustainable returns, and enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to draw on the external investment managers' market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe original text discusses the expenses associated with hiring external investment managers, listing specific costs and noting that these expenses vary annually due to market factors. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in vocabulary, structure, and emphasis that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the expenses: fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes.\n- The core message—that these expenses vary annually due to market factors—is consistently conveyed.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Transaction costs\" vs. \"transaction fees\":** Some translations use \"transaction costs,\" which is slightly broader and less precise than \"transaction fees,\" which is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **\"Vary annually\" vs. \"vary from year to year\":** While both are correct, \"vary annually\" is more concise and natural in formal writing.\n- **\"Primarily due to market factors\" vs. \"primarily influenced by market factors\":** Both are acceptable, but \"primarily due to market factors\" is more direct and concise.\n- **Word order and flow:** Some translations place \"primarily influenced by market factors\" after \"vary annually,\" which slightly disrupts the flow. A more natural structure would be to state the cause before the effect.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"transaction fees\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"vary annually\" for conciseness.\n- Place the causal phrase (\"primarily due to market factors\") before the effect (\"vary annually\") for better flow.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually, primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately translate key terms such as \"investment environment,\" \"risk management,\" and \"three-line defense system.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory or financial documents.\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" consistently, which is the correct and commonly used abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" (first translation), which is incorrect. The correct entity is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use phrases like \"has established,\" \"has implemented,\" and \"has set up\" repeatedly, which can make the text feel repetitive and less fluent. A more varied structure would enhance readability.\n- **Nuance and Precision:** The original text uses terms like \"穩健的風險管理\" (\"robust\/sound risk management\") and \"三重防線\" (\"three-line defense system\"). While all translations capture these concepts, some use \"three-line-of-defense framework\" or \"three-line defense system,\" which are acceptable but could be more precisely aligned with standard financial terminology.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The translations are generally culturally appropriate, but the use of \"strategic planning and diversified investment activities\" or \"portfolio diversification\" may vary slightly in emphasis compared to the original, which emphasizes \"多元化投資工作\" (\"diversified investment work\").\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly.\n- Vary sentence structure to avoid repetition and enhance fluency.\n- Use precise financial terminology, such as \"three-line defense system\" or \"three-line-of-defense framework,\" depending on the most commonly accepted usage in financial governance contexts.\n- Ensure that the translation reflects the original's emphasis on \"穩健的風險管理\" (\"robust\/sound risk management\") and \"多元化投資工作\" (\"diversified investment work\") with appropriate English equivalents.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone suitable for regulatory or institutional communication.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making robust risk management even more critical. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA has set up a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. It regularly monitors major categories of investment risk, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, and has established risk management procedures to provide a solid framework for strategic planning and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately translate key terms such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"ESG,\" and \"responsible investment.\"\n- Most translations capture the main idea that ESG factors are integrated into the investment process when risk-adjusted returns are comparable.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"HKMAO\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is an error. It also uses \"Sustainable Development Report\" with a capital \"S\" in \"Sustainable,\" which is inconsistent with the original text.\n- **Translation 2** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly referencing the \"2024 Sustainability Report.\" However, it uses \"offer long-term returns comparable to other investment options after adjusting for risk,\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"while also reducing\" which is slightly more natural than \"and also reduce.\" However, it repeats \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"HKMA's Investment Fund\" instead of the \"Exchange Fund,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"Investment Fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not accurate.\n- **Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, using \"risk-adjusted long-term returns\" correctly and referencing the \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\" with the correct capitalization.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"moderately emphasizing\" instead of \"appropriately emphasizing,\" which slightly changes the nuance. It also uses \"responsible investing\" instead of \"responsible investment,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct acronym \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Accurately refer to the \"Exchange Fund\" and not \"Investment Fund.\"\n- Use \"responsible investment\" as a noun phrase, which is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- Correctly reference the \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\" with the correct capitalization.\n- Use natural and fluent English without unnecessary repetition or awkward phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while avoiding their weaknesses.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund. Its guiding principle is that ESG investments are generally prioritized when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. Details regarding the HKMA's work on responsible investment are provided in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2024\n\nThe original sentence, \"2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好,\" is a straightforward statement about the general performance of global financial markets in 2024. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and tone that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nTranslation 1: \"Global financial markets performed generally well in 2024.\"  \nThis is concise and accurate. The use of \"generally well\" is appropriate and conveys the nuance of \"大致良好\" effectively. However, the absence of the article \"the\" before \"global financial markets\" may feel slightly less natural in formal English writing.\nTranslation 2: \"The global financial markets performed generally well in 2024.\"  \nThis version is very similar to Translation 1 but includes the article \"the,\" which makes the sentence sound more natural and complete in English. It is a slight improvement in terms of fluency.\nTranslation 3: \"Global financial markets performed generally well in 2024.\"  \nThis is identical to Translation 1 and shares the same strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 4: \"The global financial markets' performance was generally good in 2024.\"  \nThis version uses a passive structure and the word \"good\" instead of \"well.\" While grammatically correct, \"good\" is more commonly used to describe nouns (e.g., \"a good performance\"), whereas \"well\" is used to describe actions or behaviors. This makes \"performed well\" more idiomatic than \"performance was good.\" The possessive form \"markets'\" is also slightly more complex than necessary.\nTranslation 5: \"The global financial markets performed reasonably well in 2024.\"  \nThis version uses \"reasonably well\" instead of \"generally well.\" While both are acceptable, \"reasonably well\" implies a more moderate or cautious assessment, which may not fully align with the original's more neutral \"大致良好.\"\nTranslation 6: \"The global financial markets performed fairly well in 2024.\"  \nThis is similar to Translation 5, using \"fairly well\" instead of \"generally well.\" \"Fairly well\" also carries a slightly more cautious or moderate tone than \"generally well,\" which may not be the best match for the original.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would retain the natural flow of the original while using idiomatic English. Including the article \"the\" before \"global financial markets\" improves fluency, and \"generally well\" is the most accurate and natural equivalent of \"大致良好.\" The passive structure in Translation 4 and the more cautious tone in Translations 5 and 6 are less aligned with the original's neutral and general assessment.\nGlobal financial markets performed generally well in 2024.\n\nMajor stock markets recorded significant gains in 2024, with the U.S. stock market notably outperforming in the first three quarters amid generally favorable economic and inflation trends, as well as the AI boom. However, market conditions in the fourth quarter became volatile and retreated from their highs due to concerns over rising inflation and increasing bond yields, prompting investors to adopt a more cautious stance. In mainland China and Hong Kong, investor confidence improved in the third quarter following a series of proactive measures introduced by the central government to stimulate the economy and stock market. Nevertheless, both markets softened in the fourth quarter amid ongoing uncertainty regarding real economic growth.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: the global bond market experienced volatility in 2024 due to shifting interest rate policies and the anticipation of U.S. fiscal policy in 2025.\n- The use of terms like \"rate cuts,\" \"pace and extent,\" and \"downward pressure on bond prices\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in prepositions and articles:** Some translations use \"the\" before \"U.S. fiscal policy\" (e.g., Translation 1), while others omit it (e.g., Translation 4). This is a minor issue but affects consistency.\n- **Word choice:** \"Fluctuations\" (Translation 6) is slightly less precise than \"volatility\" in the context of financial markets.\n- **Verb usage:** \"Began focusing\" (Translation 3) is slightly more direct than \"began to focus\" (Translation 2 and 4), but both are acceptable.\n- **Tense and phrasing:** \"Leading to a sharp rise\" (Translation 1) is slightly more active than \"with U.S. Treasury yields rising sharply\" (Translation 2), which is more passive and less direct.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"volatility\" consistently, as it is the more standard term in financial contexts.\n- Maintain parallel structure and consistent prepositions (e.g., \"the U.S. fiscal policy\").\n- Use active voice where appropriate to enhance clarity and fluency.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"putting downward pressure on bond prices\" is used consistently, as it is a standard expression in financial writing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe global bond market experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although major central banks generally established the direction of rate cuts, the pace and extent of these cuts changed multiple times throughout the year. By the fourth quarter, the market began focusing on the U.S. fiscal policy for 2025, leading to a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields during the quarter and putting downward pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to interest rate trends and the relatively strong performance of the US economy.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2024.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, which included:\n\n- Bond investment income of HKD 135.9 billion;  \n- Stock investment income of HKD 90.9 billion (of which HKD 21.8 billion from Hong Kong stock investments and HKD 69.1 billion from other stock investments);  \n- A downward foreign exchange valuation adjustment of HKD 35.6 billion for non-HKD assets; and  \n- Other investment income of HKD 27.6 billion held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund Investment Holdings.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation gains of HKD 2.8 billion.\n\nBy the end of 2024, the total value of the Exchange Fund's assets reached HKD 408.1 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 54.12 billion, of which private equity accounted for HKD 43.48 billion and real estate for HKD 10.64 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment within the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 28.86 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality and professionalism of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key figures (5.2%, 7.2%, 4.1%, 11.2%) and the timeframes (2024, since 2009).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of information.\n- The use of terms like \"annualized internal rate of return\" is accurate and appropriate in a financial context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is variation in the name of the fund: \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" and \"foreign exchange fund.\" The most formal and commonly used term in official contexts is \"Exchange Fund,\" which should be used consistently.\n- **\"Supporting Portfolio\" vs. \"Support Portfolio\":** The term \"support portfolio\" is used in some translations, but \"supporting portfolio\" may be more natural in English.\n- **\"Comprised of\" vs. \"with\":** The sixth translation uses \"comprised of,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal and less commonly used in financial reporting than \"with.\"\n- **\"Since the commencement of its investments\" vs. \"since its inception\":** While both are correct, \"since its inception\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Capitalization of Portfolio Names:** Some translations capitalize \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" and \"Strategic Asset Portfolio,\" which is appropriate if these are official names. However, this should be consistent across the translation.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, as it is the standard term in financial reporting.\n- Use \"supporting portfolio\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"with\" instead of \"comprised of\" for smoother readability.\n- Use \"since its inception\" for conciseness and formality.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of portfolio names if they are official titles.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) achieved an investment return rate of 5.2% in 2024, with the investment portfolio returning 7.2% and the supporting portfolio returning 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has delivered an annualized internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 displays the investment return rates of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The Exchange Fund's average return rates were 2.0% from 2022 to 2024, 3.1% from 2020 to 2024, 3.1% from 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% since 1994.

However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject as the \"functional departments\" or \"institutional functional departments\" supporting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- The key concepts—transparency, accountability, efficiency, professionalism—are consistently translated.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" as an acronym is appropriately introduced in some translations, enhancing clarity.\n- The mention of communication channels (traditional and social media, website, information center, etc.) is accurately rendered in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use repetitive phrasing, such as \"maintaining high transparency and accountability\" or \"demonstrating excellent\/exceptional\/outstanding efficiency and professionalism.\" While these are accurate, they lack variation and can feel formulaic.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The use of \"maintaining communication\" in some translations is slightly less dynamic than \"engages with\" or \"maintains contact with.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"broader society\" while others use \"wider community\" or \"broader community.\" A consistent term would enhance readability.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"the HKMA\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better flow.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the language should be more fluid and varied, avoiding repetitive structures. The term \"HKMA\" should be introduced once with the full name, and then used consistently. The phrase \"actively engages with\" is more dynamic than \"maintains communication with.\" Also, \"broader community\" is more natural than \"broader society\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe functional departments of the organization support the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in its operations, ensuring a high degree of transparency and accountability, and demonstrating excellence in efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, the HKMA actively engages with the broader community and market participants through traditional and social media, its website, the HKMA Information Centre, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is committed to building a flexible, responsive, and professional work team, while upholding strict fiscal discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to address changes and ensure the effective implementation of all policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media Applications\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 傳媒關係及社交媒體應用\". The key terms are \"傳媒關係\" (media relations) and \"社交媒體應用\" (social media applications). The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are some nuances to consider.\nThe first junior translator used \"Social Media Engagement\" instead of \"Applications,\" which is a more general term and may not fully capture the intent of \"應用\" (application, usage, or implementation). The second through sixth translators all used \"Applications,\" which is more precise in this context.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in the original text is important as it suggests this is a heading or title, likely for a document or section. The first and fifth translators included the hashtag in their translations, which is appropriate. However, the others omitted it, which may be a minor oversight depending on the context.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct. However, \"Social Media Applications\" is a more formal and precise term than \"Social Media Engagement,\" which is more about interaction or involvement. Given the context of \"應用\" (application), \"Applications\" is more accurate.\nConsidering cultural appropriateness, the term \"Media Relations\" is standard in English business and public relations contexts, so it is appropriate. \"Social Media Applications\" is also a commonly used term in professional settings.\nThe best possible translation would retain the hashtag if it is part of the original formatting, use \"Applications\" for precision, and maintain the structure as a heading. Therefore, the improved translation is:\n# Media Relations and Social Media Applications\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its efforts to maintain communication with the media.\n- The numerical data (207 events, 14 press conferences, etc.) are consistently translated across all versions.\n- The key themes—transparency, public understanding, tokenization, anti-fraud measures, and SME support—are all accurately captured.\n- The use of terms like \"bilingual press releases\" and \"media inquiries\" is appropriate and consistent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Instant interviews\" vs. \"on-site interviews\" vs. \"site visits\":** The term \"instant interviews\" is awkward and not commonly used in formal contexts. \"On-site interviews\" is more natural, though \"media interviews\" is even more standard. \"Site visits\" is incorrect in this context, as it implies physical visits rather than interviews.\n- **\"Mainland\" vs. \"mainland\" vs. \"international\":** The term \"mainland\" is acceptable, but \"Mainland China\" is more precise. \"International\" is less specific than \"overseas\" or \"outside Hong Kong.\"\n- **\"Anti-scam measures\" vs. \"anti-fraud measures\":** \"Anti-fraud\" is more standard in formal contexts than \"anti-scam.\"\n- **\"Processed\" vs. \"handled\" vs. \"addressed\":** \"Processed\" is too technical for media inquiries. \"Handled\" and \"addressed\" are more natural and commonly used in this context.\n- **\"Routine media inquiries\" vs. \"daily media inquiries\":** \"Routine\" is more appropriate than \"daily,\" as it implies regular, recurring inquiries rather than inquiries that occur every day.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"media interviews\" instead of \"instant interviews\" or \"on-site interviews.\"\n- Use \"Mainland China\" for clarity.\n- Use \"anti-fraud measures\" for consistency with formal terminology.\n- Use \"handled\" or \"addressed\" for media inquiries.\n- Use \"routine media inquiries\" for a more natural and professional tone.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural and professional language while maintaining accuracy and consistency with the original text.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2024, the HKMA organized or participated in a total of 207 events, including 14 press conferences, four media briefings, 14 media interviews, and 175 other public events. To enhance public awareness of the HKMA’s core functions, the HKMA held press conferences and media briefings for local, Mainland China, and overseas media, covering topics such as tokenization, anti-fraud measures, and support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Throughout the year, the HKMA also arranged 25 media interviews, issued approximately 600 bilingual press releases, and addressed a large number of routine media inquiries.\n\nMr. Yu Weiwen, CEO, was interviewed by the media on-site at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2024.\"\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Vice President, delivered a welcome speech at the \"Account Interconnection\" Use Case Demonstration Day.\n\nMedia representatives actively participated in events organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2024, particularly the third \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit received over 10,000 news reports from local, mainland, and international media.\n\nMr. Yu Weiwén, Chairman, accepted a live media interview at the \"2024 International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\"\n\nMr. Ruan Guoheng, Executive Vice President, chaired a media briefing on the establishment of the Special Task Force for SME Financing.\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Vice President, delivered the opening remarks at the \"2024 Financial Markets Summit.\"\n\nTo better engage the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) operates six social media platforms (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube), which have attracted over 200,000 followers. The HKMA produces creative social media content to raise public awareness of a range of topics and initiatives, such as fraud prevention, fintech, green and sustainable finance, support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and major events hosted by the HKMA. The HKMA also livestreams the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" on its social media platforms, fostering public and industry participation.\n\nPosting creative content on social media can help enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's initiatives and various topics.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) public inquiry service and its role in educating the public about the authority's functions and operations. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in style, formality, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently. It is clear and formal, suitable for official contexts.\n**Translation 2** omits \"Hong Kong\" from the name of the authority, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the context. This could lead to ambiguity, especially in international settings.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"the Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is less precise and may not be suitable for an official document.\n**Translation 4** uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable if the reader is familiar with the term. However, the use of \"enquiry\" (British spelling) may be inconsistent with the rest of the text, which uses \"inquiry\" (American spelling).\n**Translation 5** is similar to Translation 4 but uses \"enquiry\" and \"HKMA\" consistently. It is clear and concise, though the use of \"enquiry\" may be regionally specific.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"the authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in the second half of the sentence. This is slightly less precise and may be confusing.\n**Improvements and Reasoning:**\n- The full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" should be used for clarity and formality, especially in official contexts.\n- Consistency in spelling is important: \"inquiry\" is more commonly used in American English, while \"enquiry\" is British. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is used in Hong Kong, it may be more appropriate to use \"enquiry\" to reflect the local context.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation is acceptable but should be introduced with the full name first for clarity.\n- The phrase \"provides citizens with an effective channel to enhance their understanding\" is clear but could be slightly refined for fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s public enquiry service provides citizens with an effective channel to enhance their understanding of the Authority’s main functions and operations.\n\nIn 2024, the Public Inquiry Service handled a total of 9,594 inquiries (Figure 1), all of which were responded to within the HKMA’s service commitment timeframe (Table 1). Approximately half of these inquiries concerned banking consumer affairs, financial infrastructure and bond market development, banking policies and regulations, as well as banknotes and coins (Figure 2). Common inquiries included the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and notices, and \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe original phrase \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數\" translates to \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\" or \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with slight differences in word choice and punctuation.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate use of \"Figure 1\" to denote the visual element and the correct use of \"Public\" to refer to the general populace. The use of \"Queries\" and \"Inquiries\" both convey the idea of questions or requests made by the public, though \"Inquiries\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official or statistical contexts.\nWeaknesses include minor inconsistencies in punctuation and phrasing. For example, the fifth translation omits the colon after \"Figure 1,\" which is standard in such captions. Additionally, some translations use \"Queries\" while others use \"Inquiries,\" with no clear justification for the choice.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"Inquiries\" due to its formal tone, which is appropriate for a statistical or official context. It would also include the colon after \"Figure 1\" to maintain consistency with standard formatting. Therefore, the improved translation is \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries.\"\n\nFigure 2: Breakdown of Inquiries Received in 2024, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nThe original text provides a concise summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) publications and the awards received by its reports. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are variations in terminology, style, and institutional names that require refinement.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the publisher of the reports.\n- The key awards and categories are accurately translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original's logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Institutional Names:** There is inconsistency in the translation of \"香港會計師公會\" (Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and \"香港管理專業協會\" (Hong Kong Institute of Management). Some translations use \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants\" or \"Hong Kong Institute of Management Professionals,\" which may not be the official English names.\n- **Award Titles:** The award names vary slightly, such as \"Judge's Commendation Award\" vs. \"Merit Award\" vs. \"Award of Commendation.\" These should be standardized to match the official English titles of the awards.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use overly formal or awkward phrasing, such as \"received the Judging Commendation Award\" or \"the Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2024\" without proper punctuation.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat the year or the report titles unnecessarily, which can make the text feel verbose.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the official English names of the institutions and awards to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n- Standardize the terminology for awards (e.g., \"Merit Award\" or \"Commendation Award\") to match the official titles.\n- Improve sentence flow and reduce redundancy for better readability.\n- Ensure that the translation maintains a professional and concise tone, consistent with the original text.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the official names of the institutions and awards, maintain a clear and concise structure, and ensure grammatical and stylistic fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority published its \"2023 Annual Report\" and \"2023 Sustainability Report.\" The \"2023 Sustainability Report\" received a Merit Award in the \"Public\/Non-Profit Organizations (Large)\" category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants' \"Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2024.\" Additionally, the \"2023 Annual Report\" won a Bronze Award in the \"Non-Profit and Charitable Organizations\" category of the Hong Kong Institute of Management's 2024 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly updated the \"Monthly Financial Data Report\" and published:\n\n- Two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability  \n- Four issues of the Quarterly Report; and  \n- 14 articles from the \"Insights\" publication.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text lists three items: two issues of a semi-annual report, four issues of a quarterly report, and 14 articles from a publication titled \"匯思.\" The junior translators have made various attempts to render this into English, but there are notable inconsistencies and inaccuracies.\nThe first junior translator provides a clear and grammatically correct translation, using \"Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability\" and \"Quarterly Report,\" and translating \"匯思\" as \"Insights.\" This is a strong and fluent translation.\nThe second junior translator uses \"Semi-annual Report\" with a hyphen, which is acceptable, but \"Huishi\" is left in transliteration without explanation, which may be confusing for English readers unfamiliar with the term.\nThe third junior translator misinterprets the title of the first report as \"Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Report,\" which is not accurate. Also, \"Hui Si\" is translated as \"Think Tank,\" which is a misinterpretation of the term \"匯思\" (which likely means \"Insights\" or \"Reflections\").\nThe fourth junior translator uses \"Report on Monetary and Financial Stability\" without the word \"Semi-Annual,\" which omits a key descriptor. However, \"Insights\" is a good translation for \"匯思.\"\nThe fifth junior translator incorrectly translates \"匯思\" as \"Fiscal Monitor,\" which is a completely different publication and unrelated to the original term.\nThe sixth junior translator uses \"Huisi\" in transliteration without explanation, which is less reader-friendly than using a translated term like \"Insights.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\n- Two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability  \n- Four issues of the Quarterly Report; and  \n- 14 articles from the \"Insights\" publication.\n\n# Organization Website\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) website, detailing the amount and types of information available, including legal registers maintained under specific ordinances. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and adherence to official English conventions.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the website URL and the number of pages (over 73,000).\n- Most translations accurately convey the availability of English and Chinese (both traditional and simplified) versions.\n- The legal registers are generally translated with appropriate terminology, though there is some variation in the exact titles used.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term \"institution\" is used in some translations, which is less precise than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"HKMA.\" Also, \"authorized,\" \"recognized,\" and \"licensed\" are used interchangeably, which may not align with the exact legal terminology in the original text.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"making it convenient for the public to access\" or \"facilitating public access to the latest information from the HKMA.\" These can be more naturally phrased.\n- **Register Titles:** The titles of the legal registers differ slightly across translations, which may affect clarity and consistency. For example, \"Stored Value Payment Tools\" vs. \"Stored Value Facilities\" or \"Value-Added Payment Tools.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"institution\" instead of \"HKMA\" may be less clear to English-speaking audiences unfamiliar with the term.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Ensure consistent use of legal terminology, such as \"Recognized Institutions\" and \"Licensed Operators\" as per the original text.\n- Improve sentence flow and use more natural phrasing, such as \"provides access to\" instead of \"making it convenient for the public to access.\"\n- Standardize the titles of the legal registers to match the original Chinese, ensuring accuracy and consistency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 73,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, providing the public with easy access to the latest information from the HKMA. The website also includes the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Instruments,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments Ordinance.\n\nSince 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been progressively releasing financial data and important information published on its website through open application programming interfaces (open APIs). As of the end of 2024, a total of 177 open APIs have been launched on the website in accordance with the original plan. For more detailed information about the HKMA’s open APIs, please visit the HKMA Open API portal at https:\/\/apidocs.hkma.gov.hk.\n\n# Information Center\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre as the 55th floor of Phase 2 of the International Finance Centre.\n- Each translation accurately conveys the purpose of the Information Centre: to introduce the HKMA's work and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations dividing the Information Centre into an exhibition hall and a library.\n- The use of terms such as \"interactive displays,\" \"materials and exhibits,\" and \"research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Terminology:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"the Authority.\" While this is not a major issue, consistency in terminology is important for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more fluent than others. For example, the first and third translations use more natural phrasing, such as \"comprises an exhibition hall and a library\" and \"introduces the HKMA's functions.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Two International Finance Centre\" is used in some translations, which is not the standard name. The correct and commonly used name is \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations use phrases like \"enhance public awareness\" or \"enhance public understanding,\" which are both correct but slightly redundant. \"Enhance public understanding\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Clarity of Purpose:** Some translations use \"its purpose is to introduce\" while others use \"its aim is to introduce.\" Both are acceptable, but \"its aim is to introduce\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for an official description.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, with \"HKMA\" in parentheses for clarity.\n- Use the standard name \"International Finance Centre Phase 2\" to ensure cultural and geographical accuracy.\n- Use more natural and fluent phrasing, such as \"comprises two sections\" instead of \"divided into two parts.\"\n- Use precise and concise language, such as \"enhance public understanding\" instead of \"enhance public awareness.\"\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is varied and avoids repetition, while maintaining clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2 and comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. Its aim is to introduce the HKMA's work to the public and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The exhibition hall provides an interactive introduction to the HKMA's functions and the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors, and also features reference materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe original text provides factual information about the number of visitors to an information center and the number of guided tours provided. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in word choice, phrasing, and style.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate numerical data and the correct use of terms like \"information center\" and \"guided tours.\" However, there are minor inconsistencies in prepositions (\"within the year\" vs. \"this year\"), the use of \"information center\" (with or without capitalization), and the phrasing of the increase (\"an increase of about 120%\" vs. \"a 120% increase from\").\nThe use of \"welcomed\" is more natural than \"received\" in the context of visitors. Additionally, \"on over 570 occasions\" is slightly more formal and less direct than \"over 570 times\" or \"over 570 guided tours.\"\nThe best translation would maintain consistency in terminology, use natural phrasing, and ensure clarity and fluency. It should also reflect the formal tone of the original text, which appears to be from a report or official statement.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation would be:\nThe information center welcomed over 68,000 visitors this year, a 120% increase compared to 2023. It also provided over 570 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision that affect the quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the library's location, the number of items in its collection, and the topics covered.\n- Each version accurately references Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance and the two registers maintained by the library.\n- The use of terms like \"public inspection\" or \"public reference\" is consistent with the intent of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term used for the institutions varies between \"Authorized,\" \"Recognized,\" and \"Approved.\" In the context of Hong Kong's legal and regulatory framework, \"Recognized\" is the most appropriate term, as it aligns with the official terminology used in the Banking Ordinance.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"holds\" or \"maintains\" in a way that feels slightly mechanical. \"Houses\" or \"contains\" may be more natural in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Clarity:** Some translations repeat \"the library\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n- **Cultural and Legal Appropriateness:** The term \"local representative offices\" is more precise than \"local representatives\" when referring to the register, as it reflects the formal structure of the institution.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"Recognized\" consistently for institutions, as it is the standard term in Hong Kong's legal context.\n- Use \"houses\" or \"contains\" instead of \"holds\" for a more natural tone.\n- Avoid redundancy by varying sentence structure and reducing repetition of \"the library.\"\n- Ensure that the titles of the registers are precise and match the original Chinese, using \"Local Representative Offices\" and \"Securities Business Employees\" for clarity and legal accuracy.\n- Use \"public reference\" or \"public inspection\" depending on the intended nuance, but \"public reference\" is more commonly used in legal and institutional contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe library, located adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. It also maintains the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Recognized Institutions' Securities Business Employees,\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, for public reference.\n\nKindergarten students participated in a guided tour of the Information Centre to learn about the design of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nInformation center staff introduced visitors to a mosaic artwork created using Hong Kong coins, depicting the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\nThe original Chinese phrase \"社區聯繫及公眾教育\" can be translated in several ways, depending on the nuance intended. The term \"聯繫\" can be translated as \"Engagement,\" \"Contact,\" or \"Liaison,\" each carrying slightly different connotations. \"Engagement\" suggests active participation and interaction, which is often preferred in community-related contexts. \"Contact\" is more neutral and transactional, while \"Liaison\" implies a more formal or intermediary role.\n\"Public Education\" is a direct and widely accepted translation of \"公眾教育,\" and all the provided translations agree on this part. However, the use of the hashtag \"#\" in some translations may not be appropriate unless the text is intended for social media or a list of headings. In formal or professional contexts, it is better to omit the hashtag unless it is part of the original formatting.\nAmong the translations, \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" appears most frequently and is the most natural and widely understood term in English for this context. It conveys the idea of active involvement and interaction with the community, which aligns well with the original Chinese phrase.\n\"Community Liaison and Public Education\" is also a valid translation, but \"Liaison\" may be less commonly used in this context compared to \"Engagement.\" It may be more appropriate in a formal or administrative setting.\n\"Community Contact and Public Education\" is a more neutral and less dynamic translation, which may not fully capture the active nature of \"聯繫\" in the original phrase.\nIn conclusion, \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" is the most accurate and natural translation of \"社區聯繫及公眾教育,\" as it effectively conveys the intended meaning and is widely understood in English-speaking contexts.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998, attracting over 68,000 participants to date. In 2024, we held an online seminar that drew more than 800 students and teachers from 41 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an overview of the HKMA's functions, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, fraud prevention, the deposit protection scheme, green finance, and opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nWe use various channels to reach out to and educate the public, reminding them how to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers. The 2024 activities attracted a total of over 67,000 citizens to participate.\n\nTo align with the trends of digital payments and green living, we are promoting through social media and radio, encouraging citizens to give electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year period, and also considering the distribution of physical red envelopes using \"New Year banknotes.\"\n\nProducing an animated short film encourages the distribution of electronic red envelopes.\n\n# Anti-Scam Song — \"Don't Click on Random Links\"\n\nTo further strengthen anti-fraud efforts, we have launched an anti-fraud song performed by singer Mr. Yuen Kwong and Mr. Ruan Guoheng, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, reminding the public \"Don't Take Fake Links Seriously, Don't Let People Deceive You,\" and emphasizing the importance of properly safeguarding sensitive personal information and credit card data. The effectiveness of the cross-media promotional campaign has been recognized, earning it international promotional accolades.\n\nVice President Mr. Ruan Guo-Heng (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\n\nCross-media promotional campaigns enhance public awareness of fraud prevention.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is: \"跨媒體宣傳活動加強公眾防騙意識\" which translates to \"Cross-media promotional activities strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\"\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical precision.\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Cross-media promotional campaign enhances public awareness of fraud prevention.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"campaign\" in singular, which may not fully reflect the plural nature of \"activities\" in the original. Also, \"enhances\" is slightly less strong than \"strengthens.\"\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Cross-media promotional activities enhance public awareness of fraud prevention.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately reflects the plural \"activities\" and uses \"enhance,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less dynamic than \"strengthen.\"\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Cross-media publicity campaigns enhance public awareness of fraud prevention.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"publicity campaigns,\" which is a common term in media contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Publicity\" is slightly more formal and may not be as commonly used in modern marketing contexts as \"promotional.\"\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Cross-media promotional campaigns strengthen public awareness of fraud.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"strengthen,\" which is a strong verb.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fraud\" is too vague; the original specifies \"fraud prevention,\" which is more precise.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Cross-media promotional campaigns enhance public awareness against scams.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Against scams\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Scams\" is more informal than \"fraud prevention,\" which may not match the tone of the original.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Cross-media publicity campaign enhances public awareness of fraud prevention.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and uses \"publicity campaign.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Singular \"campaign\" again, and \"publicity\" may not be the best term in this context.\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"promotional campaigns\" to align with modern marketing terminology.\n- Use the plural \"campaigns\" to match the original's \"activities.\"\n- Use \"strengthen\" for a stronger, more active verb.\n- Retain \"fraud prevention\" for clarity and precision.\n- Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in English.\nThus, the best translation is:  \n**\"Cross-media promotional campaigns strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\"**\n\n# Cross-Border Wealth Management: New Opportunities (TV Short Film Series)\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the main actor and mention the collaboration with a local TV station.\n- The titles of the TV series are translated consistently as variations of “New Opportunities in Cross-Border Wealth Management.”\n- The key elements of the program—such as the use of iconic scenes from Hong Kong films, the explanation of the framework, eligibility, products, risk management, and promotion channels—are all present in each version.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term “跨境理財通” is translated inconsistently as “Cross-Border Wealth Management Link,” “Cross-Border Wealth Management,” “Wealth Management Connect,” or “Cross-Border Wealth Management Pilot Scheme.” This inconsistency may confuse readers and should be standardized.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as using “also known as” or repeating the same term multiple times (e.g., “Cross-border Wealth Management”).\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as “help citizens further understand” or “utilizes iconic scenes,” which can be made more natural.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The phrase “classic scenes from five iconic Hong Kong films” is slightly redundant and could be more succinctly phrased as “iconic scenes from five popular Hong Kong films.”\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term “跨境理財通” should be consistently translated as “Cross-Border Wealth Management Link” (CWML), as this is the official term used in English financial contexts.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** The translation should avoid redundancy and use natural, idiomatic English. For example, “help citizens further understand” can be simplified to “help the public understand.”\n- **Clarity and Precision:** The translation should clearly distinguish between “Northbound” and “Southbound” channels and ensure that the explanation of the program’s content is concise and well-structured.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with a local television station to produce a television series titled “New Opportunities in Cross-Border Wealth Management,” helping the public understand the opportunities and convenience that the Cross-Border Wealth Management Link (CWML) offers to retail investors in cross-border investments. The series uses iconic scenes from five popular Hong Kong films to explain the framework of the CWML, investor eligibility requirements, the products available through the Northbound and Southbound channels, risk management, and key considerations for cross-border investing. The series will be promoted through television, digital, and social media platforms.\n\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**短片以風趣幽默的方式介紹「跨境理財通」**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short film introduces 'Cross-Border Wealth Management Link' in a witty and humorous way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate translation of the core message.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Short film\" may not be the best term for \"短片\" in this context; \"short video\" is more commonly used in modern media. \"Witty and humorous\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short film introduces 'Cross-border Wealth Management Connect' in a humorous and witty manner.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Connect\" instead of \"Link,\" which may be more appropriate for a financial product.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Short film\" is still not ideal. \"Humorous and witty manner\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short film introduces the 'Cross-Border Wealth Management Link' in a humorous and entertaining way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"entertaining\" which adds a more natural tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Short film\" is still not the best term. \"Link\" may not be the most accurate term for the financial product.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces 'Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect' in a witty and humorous way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"short video,\" which is more natural. \"Connect\" is likely the correct term for the financial product.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Witty and humorous\" is redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces the 'Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect' in a humorous and engaging way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"short video\" and \"engaging,\" which is a more natural and appealing term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Engaging\" is slightly less precise than \"humorous\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video humorously introduces 'Cross-border Wealth Management Connect.'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"short video\" and places the adverb \"humorously\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Cross-border\" is hyphenated inconsistently with other translations.\n### Reasoning for Improvement:\n- **\"Short video\"** is more natural and modern than \"short film\" in this context.\n- **\"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\"** is likely the most accurate and commonly used term for the financial product.\n- **\"Humorous and engaging\"** or **\"in a humorous and engaging way\"** provides a more natural and appealing tone than \"witty and humorous.\"\n- **Consistency in hyphenation** and capitalization is important for clarity and professionalism.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe short video humorously introduces \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect.\"\n\n# Hong Kong's Ultimate Wealth Management Showdown\n\nTo enhance secondary students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with multiple relevant organizations to host the \"All-Hong Kong Financial Literacy Challenge.\" The event marks its 10th anniversary in 2024, with the theme \"Future Financial Talent,\" aiming to help secondary students gain early insights into innovations, financial technology, artificial intelligence, and future trends, while encouraging them to uphold sustainable development and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and cultural appropriateness that warrant careful consideration.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the two parts of the competition: the online quiz and the mentorship program.\n- The key figures (e.g., 32,000 students, 125,000 participations) are consistently translated.\n- The term \"Greater Bay Area Invitational\" is consistently used, which is appropriate for the context.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The term \"Dominance Challenge\" (used in Translation 3) and \"Championship Battle\" (used in Translation 5) are not standard translations of the original term \"爭霸戰.\" A more appropriate and commonly used term would be \"Championship Challenge.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Translation 4 contains a grammatical error with \"the online quiz环节 of the competition\" (the word \"环节\" is not translated and appears in the English text).\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The order of regions in the \"Greater Bay Area Invitational\" varies slightly across translations (e.g., \"Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong\" vs. \"Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau\"). While both are acceptable, consistency in the order is preferable for clarity and cultural sensitivity.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Financial literacy\" (used in Translation 6) is slightly more formal than \"financial knowledge\" or \"financial understanding,\" which may be more appropriate depending on the intended audience.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Championship Challenge\" consistently as the official name of the competition.\n- Ensure that all numerical data is clearly presented and grammatically correct.\n- Maintain a consistent order of regions when referring to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau region.\n- Use \"financial knowledge\" or \"financial understanding\" rather than \"financial literacy\" unless the context specifically requires a more formal tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe first part of the Championship Challenge is an online quiz competition, testing participants' financial knowledge and understanding of popular financial topics. In 2024, 32,000 students from 290 secondary schools participated in the online quiz, setting a new record. Between 2015 and 2024, approximately 125,000 students from 440 secondary schools participated in the online quiz segment of the Championship Challenge. The second part of the Championship Challenge, the \"Youth Financial Talent Program,\" is conducted in a mentorship format, with experienced professionals from various fields serving as mentors to train students for the \"Design Thinking Challenge.\" In 2024, this part of the Championship Challenge introduced a special \"Greater Bay Area Invitational\" to promote interaction and exchange among students from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau.\n\nVice President Chen Weimin delivered a welcome speech at the championship finals and encouraged the participants.\n\nStudents participating in the \"Youth Financial Talent Program\" meet with their mentors.\nThe original Chinese text is: 參與「少年金融人才計劃」的學生與導師會面.\nAll six translations are very similar, with only minor differences in punctuation, tense, and wording. Here is a critical evaluation of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: \"Students participating in the 'Youth Financial Talent Program' meet with their mentors.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate translation, correct grammar, and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None significant. The use of \"their\" is appropriate, indicating a direct relationship between students and mentors.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Same as the first.  \n   - **Strengths and weaknesses**: Identical to the first, so the same applies.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Same as the first.  \n   - **Strengths and weaknesses**: Identical to the first, so the same applies.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: \"Students participating in the Youth Financial Talent Program meet with mentors.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: The translation is still accurate and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The omission of quotation marks around the program name is slightly less formal, though not incorrect. Also, \"mentors\" without \"their\" is slightly less specific but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: \"Students participating in the 'Youth Financial Talent Program' met with their mentors.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The use of past tense (\"met\") may not be appropriate unless the meeting has already occurred. The original text does not specify a time, so present tense is more neutral and appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: \"Students and mentors participating in the 'Young Financial Talent Program' will meet.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: The use of \"will meet\" implies a future event, which may be appropriate if the meeting is scheduled.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"students and mentors participating\" changes the meaning slightly, suggesting that both groups are participating in the program, rather than the students being part of the program and meeting with mentors. Also, \"Young Financial Talent Program\" is slightly different from the original \"少年金融人才計劃,\" which more accurately translates to \"Youth Financial Talent Program.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The original text uses present tense, indicating a general or ongoing action, so present tense is most appropriate.\n- The phrase \"their mentors\" adds clarity and specificity.\n- The program name should be in quotation marks and accurately translated as \"Youth Financial Talent Program.\"\n- The structure \"Students participating in the 'Youth Financial Talent Program' meet with their mentors\" is the most accurate, natural, and grammatically sound translation.\n\n# Educational Tabletop Games\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative to launch and promote a financial education board game, emphasizing its educational value for primary school students. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the organization and accurately convey the timeline (2023 launch, 2024 promotion).\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"financial education board game\" and \"simulated scenarios.\"\n- The core message about the game's educational purpose for students is preserved in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Administration\" (Translation 3), which is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- **Game Title:** Some translations alter the title to \"$mart Financial 321\" or \"$mart Finance 321\" (Translations 4, 5, 6), whereas the original uses \"$mart理財321,\" which should be kept as is, with the Chinese characters in the title.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Translation 1 uses \"Li Cai\" instead of the original Chinese characters, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. Translation 3 uses \"tabletop game\" instead of \"board game,\" which is less common in this context.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"elementary school students\" (Translation 3) is less commonly used in English-speaking contexts than \"primary school students.\"\n- **Verb Tense:** Translation 3 uses \"continues to promote\" in the present tense, which is inconsistent with the past context of 2023 and 2024.\n**Improvements:**\n- Retain the original title with Chinese characters: \"$mart理財321.\"\n- Use \"board game\" rather than \"tabletop game\" for consistency with the original.\n- Use \"primary school students\" for cultural appropriateness.\n- Ensure consistent verb tenses and use \"continued to promote\" for 2024.\n- Use \"raise awareness of this original board game among the public\" for clarity and completeness.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the original title, use consistent terminology, and ensure fluency and cultural appropriateness.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched its first financial education board game, \"$mart理財321,\" in 2023 and continued to promote it in 2024 to raise awareness of this original board game among the public and enhance its role as an educational tool. The game allows primary school students to learn about different payment methods, basic financial concepts, financial technology, and cybersecurity through simulated scenarios.\n\nAt the community level, we set up a booth at the \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024\" and organized workshops during the Christmas and Lunar New Year periods, as well as parent-child workshops at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) offices, to further promote financial and money management concepts. In addition, we arranged school visits for primary students to try out the board games and conducted training workshops to encourage secondary school teachers to use board games as one of the teaching materials in the financial education module of the newly introduced secondary school subject \"Citizenship, Economics, and Society.\" The board games have been recognized by the Education Bureau as one of the outstanding teaching tools and were used as prizes for winning schools in its \"Financial Education School Award Scheme (2023\/24).\" In 2024, the HKMA conducted approximately 40 board game workshops, attracting participation from over 3,600 students, parents, teachers, and social workers.\n\nBased on the provided translations, several observations can be made regarding their strengths and weaknesses:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a new board game based on their previous experience, and it is the first of its kind in Hong Kong to teach students about green finance.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically correct.\n- The term \"green finance\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and accurate.\n- The event name \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024\" is correctly translated and formatted in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"souvenir\" but omits the possessive form \"its\" when referring to the HKMA's booth, which slightly weakens the clarity.\n- **Translation 2** correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" with the acronym, which is good for clarity, but the phrase \"strategic board game\" is slightly less common than \"strategy board game.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Corporate Greening Transformation\" instead of \"Corporate Green Transformation,\" which is a minor but notable difference in the title.\n- **Translation 4** omits the possessive \"its\" when referring to the HKMA's booth, similar to Translation 1.\n- **Translation 5** is the most detailed and uses \"impart green finance knowledge,\" which is a slightly more formal and precise verb than \"convey.\" It also includes \"its booth,\" which improves clarity.\n- **Translation 6** omits the acronym \"HKMA\" and uses \"distributed\" instead of \"given out\" or \"given away,\" which is acceptable but less dynamic.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The phrase \"Building on the experience of developing\" is slightly more natural than \"Based on the experience of developing\" or \"Drawing on the experience of developing.\"\n- The title \"Corporate Green Transformation\" is more consistent with the original Chinese and should be used rather than \"Corporate Greening Transformation.\"\n- Including the acronym \"HKMA\" after the full name improves clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the organization.\n- Using \"given away as a souvenir\" is more natural and commonly used than \"distributed as a souvenir\" or \"given out as a souvenir.\"\n- The phrase \"designed to impart green finance knowledge to students\" is more precise and formal than \"to convey green finance knowledge to students.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nBuilding on the experience of developing the \"$smart理財321\" board game, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the strategy board game \"Corporate Green Transformation,\" which is being given away as a souvenir at its booth at the \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024.\" This is the first board game in Hong Kong designed to impart green finance knowledge to students.\n\nWealth management capabilities, financial literacy, and community engagement are central themes in the original text. The junior translators have generally captured the core message, but there are variations in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nThe first translation uses \"financial literacy and financial management skills,\" which is slightly repetitive. The second and third translations use \"financial knowledge and wealth management capabilities,\" which is more varied and precise. The fourth and sixth translations use \"financial knowledge and wealth management capabilities,\" which is consistent and accurate. The fifth translation uses \"money management skills,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise than \"wealth management capabilities.\"\nThe term \"Investor and Financial Education Council\" appears in several translations, but \"Investors and Financial Education Committee\" is also used. The original text uses \"投資者及理財教育委員會,\" which translates more accurately to \"Investor and Financial Education Committee.\" The term \"committee\" is more appropriate than \"council\" in this context, as it refers to a formal body.\n\"Community engagement initiatives\" is a common and appropriate phrase, but \"community participation initiatives\" is less standard and slightly less natural in this context.\nThe phrase \"enhancing the financial literacy and wealth management capabilities of Hong Kong citizens\" is more natural and concise than \"enhancing the financial knowledge and wealth management capabilities of Hong Kong residents.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"Investor and Financial Education Committee,\" \"financial literacy and wealth management capabilities,\" and \"community engagement initiatives,\" with a natural and concise structure.\nIn addition, we continue to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Committee to enhance the financial literacy and wealth management capabilities of Hong Kong citizens, and we will explore further collaboration with various stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement initiatives.\n\nPromoting financial education to teachers, students, and parents through board game activities.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) and the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).

While Exchange Fund is a shorter version, it may be too vague without context. Hong Kong Monetary Authority refers to a specific institution, not the fund itself. Exchange Stabilization Fund is a different type of fund typically associated with central banks. The best translation would be \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" as it directly and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text.\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Auditor-General  \n- Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text consists of two items: “審計署署長報告” and “外匯基金財務報表.” These are formal titles, likely from official documents or reports. The junior translators have provided several variations, and while all are reasonably accurate, there are nuances that can be refined for clarity, formality, and consistency with standard English usage in official contexts.\n1. **\"Report by the Audit Office Director\"** – This is grammatically correct but slightly informal. \"Director\" may not be the most appropriate title for the head of an audit office in formal contexts.\n2. **\"Report by the Audit Commission Chairman\"** – \"Audit Commission\" is not a standard term in many jurisdictions. The term \"Audit Office\" is more commonly used, and \"Chairman\" may not be the correct title for the head of an audit body.\n3. **\"Auditor General's Report\"** – This is a strong and commonly used term in official contexts, especially in government and public sector reporting. It is concise and formal.\n4. **\"Audit Office Director's Report\"** – Similar to the first translation, but slightly more formal. However, \"Director\" may not be the most accurate title for the head of an audit office.\n5. **\"Auditor General's Report\"** – Same as translation 3, and is a strong choice.\n6. **\"Report of the Auditor-General\"** – This is grammatically correct and formal, but the phrasing \"Report of the Auditor-General\" is slightly more verbose than \"Auditor General's Report.\"\nFor the second item, “外匯基金財務報表,” the translations vary between \"Foreign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\" and \"Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund.\" Both are acceptable, but \"Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\" is more formal and aligns better with standard financial reporting terminology.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Auditor General's Report\" for the first item, as it is the most commonly used and formal term in official reporting.\n- Use \"Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\" for the second item, as it is more formal and aligns with standard financial terminology.\nThese choices ensure consistency, formality, and clarity in the translation, making it suitable for official or formal contexts.\n\n# Auditor-General's Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Commission\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which are set forth on pages 209 to 309. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2024, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2024, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of an Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. I addressed these matters in the course of auditing the financial statements as a whole and forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese text is a heading or title, likely from a financial reporting or accounting document. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are reasonably accurate but differ slightly in structure and nuance.\nTranslation 1 is concise but lacks the hashtag and capitalization typically used in formal headings. Translation 2 includes the hashtag and capitalizes all major words, which is appropriate for a title. Translation 3 uses \"Fair Value Measurement\" instead of \"Valuation,\" which is a slightly different phrasing but still accurate. Translation 4 is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"at\" instead of \"Measured at,\" which is slightly less precise. Translation 5 omits \"Financial\" before \"Liabilities,\" which is a minor but notable error. Translation 6 is identical to Translation 2, which is a good choice for a formal title.\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, include the hashtag if appropriate, and use precise financial terminology. \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\" is the most accurate and consistent with standard financial reporting terminology. It preserves the structure of the original, uses the correct preposition (\"Measured at\"), and includes the necessary repetition of \"Financial\" for clarity and precision.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 37.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 391.5117 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 138.6299 billion.\n\n86% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe original text discusses the fair value estimation of 14% of financial assets using Level 3 parameters, which are not based on observable market data, and specifies the total value and composition of these assets.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"HKD 552.51 billion\" is incorrect; the original states \"5,522.51億港元,\" which is 5,522.51 billion HKD, not 552.51 billion. Also, \"unlisted investment funds\" is slightly less formal than \"non-listed investment funds.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. However, it incorrectly translates \"5,522.51億港元\" as \"5,522.51 billion HK dollars,\" which is correct numerically but uses \"HK dollars\" instead of the more standard \"HKD.\" Also, \"non-listed investment funds\" is more appropriate than \"unlisted.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation has a minor error in the numerical value, stating \"HK$552.251 billion\" instead of \"5,522.51 billion.\" Additionally, \"unlisted investment funds\" is less standard than \"non-listed investment funds.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in meaning and uses \"Level 3 inputs\" instead of \"Level 3 parameters,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation. However, it incorrectly states \"HKD 552.251 billion\" instead of \"5,522.51 billion.\" Also, \"non-listed investment funds\" is preferred over \"unlisted.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in meaning and uses \"non-listed investment funds.\" However, it incorrectly states \"HKD 552.251 billion\" instead of \"5,522.51 billion.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in meaning and uses \"non-listed investment funds.\" However, it incorrectly states \"HKD 552.251 billion\" instead of \"5,522.51 billion.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe most accurate translation should reflect the correct numerical value of \"5,522.51 billion HKD\" and use the standard term \"non-listed investment funds.\" Additionally, the phrase \"Level 3 parameters\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"Level 3 inputs.\" The verb tense should be consistent, and the sentence structure should be clear and professional.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fair value of the remaining 14% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, with the parameters used not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets amount to HKD 5,522.51 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the original Chinese sentence, the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency, precision, and professional tone.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate identification of the key elements: \"significant\/substantial\/large amounts,\" \"estimates,\" \"valuation of financial assets and liabilities,\" and \"key audit matter.\"\n- Proper use of the term \"measured at fair value\" or similar expressions, which is standard in financial reporting contexts.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- **\"Amounts\" vs. \"Amount\":** The original uses \"所涉數額龐大\" (the amounts involved are substantial), which is plural. Translations 2 and 5 use \"amount\" (singular), which is less accurate. Translations 1, 3, 4, and 6 use \"amounts\" (plural), which is more consistent with the original.\n- **\"Reliance on estimates\" vs. \"use of estimates\" vs. \"need for estimates\":** While all are acceptable, \"use of estimates\" (Translation 3) is more neutral and commonly used in audit contexts. \"Reliance on estimates\" (Translation 1) is slightly more formal, while \"need for estimates\" (Translations 4 and 5) implies a necessity rather than a method.\n- **\"Financial assets and financial liabilities\" vs. \"financial assets and liabilities\":** The original specifies \"金融資產及金融負債,\" which includes the word \"financial\" for both. Translations 1, 2, 3, and 6 include \"financial\" for both, while 4 and 5 omit it for liabilities. This is a minor but important detail for precision.\n- **\"Carried at fair value\" vs. \"measured at fair value\" vs. \"accounted for at fair value\":** \"Measured at fair value\" (Translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is the most standard and precise term in accounting and auditing literature. \"Carried at fair value\" (Translation 2) is less common in this context, and \"accounted for at fair value\" (Translation 4) is somewhat redundant.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would use \"amounts\" (plural), \"use of estimates,\" and \"measured at fair value,\" while maintaining the full specification of \"financial assets and financial liabilities.\"\nFinal Translation:\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including relevant monitoring measures.\n\nEvaluate and test monitoring measures, including those related to application monitoring within computer systems.\nThe original Chinese sentence is concise and technical, focusing on the evaluation and testing of monitoring measures, particularly those related to computer system applications. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in phrasing and fluency.\nThe first three translations are grammatically correct and use \"monitoring measures related to\" or \"for relevant applications within computer systems.\" However, they repeat \"monitoring measures\" twice, which can be redundant. The fourth and fifth translations use \"Evaluation and testing monitoring measures,\" which is awkward phrasing—“evaluation and testing” should be a verb phrase, not a noun phrase. The sixth translation is more concise, using \"relevant application monitoring measures for computer systems,\" but it lacks clarity in specifying that the monitoring measures are for applications within computer systems.\nThe best translation should avoid redundancy, maintain clarity, and ensure natural English phrasing. A more fluent and precise version would be: \"Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including those related to application monitoring within computer systems.\" This version eliminates repetition, uses \"those\" to refer back to \"monitoring measures,\" and clearly specifies the scope of the applications being monitored.\n\nObtain confirmations from third parties regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nIf market quotations are used, verify the prices against independent sources.\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, the suitability of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the related assumptions should be assessed, as well as the verification of the parameters through independent sources; and\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nThe first, second, third, and fifth translations are very similar, with minor variations in verb choice (\"assess\" vs. \"evaluate\") and preposition use (\"based on\" vs. \"against\"). These differences are largely stylistic and do not significantly affect the meaning. The fourth and sixth translations offer slightly more varied structures, with the fourth using \"assess the suitability\" and \"reasonableness\" as noun phrases, which is more concise and natural in formal English. The sixth translation uses \"should be assessed\" and \"verification of parameters through independent sources,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more passive and less direct than the others.\nIn terms of fluency and naturalness, the fourth and sixth translations are the most polished, though the fourth is more concise and direct. The use of \"assess the suitability\" and \"reasonableness\" as noun phrases in the fourth translation is more idiomatic in formal writing. Additionally, \"verify the parameters using independent sources\" is more natural than \"verify the parameters based on\" or \"verify the parameters against.\"\nThe best possible translation should maintain the formal tone of the original while ensuring clarity, grammatical correctness, and natural phrasing. It should also preserve the parallel structure of the original Chinese, which lists two actions: assessing the valuation method and its assumptions, and verifying the parameters through independent sources.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation should use active voice where appropriate, maintain parallel structure, and use natural prepositions and phrasing. The final translation should reflect these considerations while remaining faithful to the original meaning.\n\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original Chinese text is a directive to evaluate the suitability of a valuation method and the reasonableness of its assumptions and parameters, particularly when the parameters are not based on observable market data.\nAll six translations capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, structure, and emphasis. The first translation begins with \"Assess the suitability...\" which is slightly more general than the original, which starts with a conditional clause. The second and fourth translations are nearly identical and follow the original structure closely, beginning with the conditional clause. The third translation starts with \"Whether the valuation method...\" which is more of a question form than a directive, slightly deviating from the original's imperative tone. The fifth and sixth translations are very similar to the second and fourth, with minor variations in verb choice (\"assess\" vs. \"evaluate\" vs. \"determine\").\nThe best translation should maintain the original's conditional structure, use precise and consistent terminology, and ensure clarity and fluency in English. \"Evaluate\" is a strong and appropriate verb in this context, and \"parameters\" and \"assumptions\" should be consistently used. The phrase \"related assumptions and parameters\" is slightly redundant; \"the assumptions and parameters\" is more concise and natural in English.\nBased on these considerations, the most accurate and fluent translation would be:\nIf the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese text is a title or heading, likely from a financial or accounting document. The junior translators have produced several variations of the English translation, with minor differences in capitalization, word choice, and phrasing.\nThe first and fourth translations use \"measured at fair value,\" which is a direct translation of the Chinese term \"按公平值列帳.\" However, in accounting terminology, the more standard and widely accepted term is \"carried at fair value.\" This is because \"carried at\" is the conventional phrasing used in financial reporting standards such as IFRS and GAAP when referring to the valuation of assets.\nThe second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Investment Properties\" with a capital \"P,\" which is appropriate if this is a formal title or section heading. However, in general English usage, \"investment property\" does not require capitalization unless it is part of a proper noun or title.\nThe third translation, \"Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value,\" is the most accurate and natural-sounding. It uses the correct accounting terminology (\"carried at fair value\") and appropriately capitalizes \"Investment Property\" if it is part of a formal heading. It also maintains a consistent and professional tone suitable for financial documents.\nThe best translation should reflect standard accounting terminology, maintain proper capitalization for formal headings, and ensure clarity and fluency in English. Therefore, the improved translation is:\nValuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, numerical formatting, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: The term \"聯營公司\" is most accurately translated as \"associate companies\" (used in translations 2, 5, and 6), while \"joint ventures\" is used in others. \"Jointly controlled entities\" (translation 3) is less standard in financial reporting. \"Associated companies\" is the most precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n2. **Numerical Formatting**: The original text states \"211.32億港元\" (HK$21.132 billion). Some translations use \"HK$21.132 billion\" (translations 1, 4, 5, 6), which is correct, while others use \"HKD 21.32 billion\" (translation 2), which is incorrect due to the decimal placement and currency symbol.\n3. **Verb Usage**: \"Carried at fair value\" (translation 1, 4, 6) is more standard in financial reporting than \"accounted for at fair value\" (translations 2, 3, 5), which is also acceptable but slightly less precise.\n4. **Fluency and Structure**: The phrase \"the fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by...\" (translations 1, 2, 4, 6) is more fluid and natural than \"regardless of whether the investment properties are held directly by the Group or through...\" (translation 3).\n5. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**: The use of \"independent professional valuers\" (translations 1, 4, 6) is more standard in financial reporting than \"appraisers\" (translation 2) or \"valuers\" (translation 3), though all are acceptable.\n6. **Nuance and Precision**: The original text uses \"主要業務為持有海外投資物業\" (\"whose primary business is the holding of overseas investment properties\"). The most accurate and natural phrasing is \"whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties\" (translations 1, 4, 5, 6), rather than \"which primarily engage in holding\" (translation 5), which is slightly less direct.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and amounted to HK$21.132 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also holds interests in associate companies and joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties. Whether held directly by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined by valuations provided by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of investment properties carried at fair value include:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined in accordance with the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports.\n\nAssess the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and\n\nAssess whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the associated assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe original text is a formal statement regarding the responsibilities of a financial management official concerning the content of an annual report. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, \"Financial Management Officer\" may not be the most accurate title for the role described, depending on the context. The use of \"other information\" is consistent with the original, and the exclusion of financial statements and the auditor's report is accurately conveyed.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"Financial Controller,\" which may not be the exact title of the role in the original. It also uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Financial Services Authority,\" which could be a misinterpretation of the original term. The structure is fluent, but the title discrepancy may affect accuracy.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Financial Management Commissioner\" is a possible title, but it may not align with the original. The term \"Financial Management Authority\" is also not clearly defined in the original text. The translation is otherwise fluent and accurate in content.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Financial Management Bureau,\" which may not be the correct titles. The phrase \"must be responsible\" is slightly awkward compared to \"is responsible.\" The translation is otherwise clear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"Financial Controller\" and \"Financial Services Commission,\" which may not be the exact titles. The structure is fluent, and the exclusion of financial statements and the auditor's report is accurately conveyed.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"Financial management officers\" (lowercase) and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the exact titles. The use of \"data\" instead of \"information\" is a minor deviation, but it is still understandable. The translation is fluent and accurate in content.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe key issues across all translations are the use of potentially incorrect titles and the choice of terms like \"data\" versus \"information.\" The original text uses \"金融管理專員\" which is best translated as \"Financial Management Officer\" or \"Financial Management Commissioner,\" depending on the official title in the relevant jurisdiction. The term \"Financial Services Authority\" or \"Monetary Authority\" may not be the exact name of the organization in the original text, so it is important to use the most accurate title available.\nThe phrase \"其他資料\" is best translated as \"other information\" rather than \"data,\" as it refers to a broader range of content, not just numerical data. The exclusion of \"財務報表及我的審計師報告\" should be clearly stated as \"excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for other information. This other information includes all the information in the 2024 Annual Report of the Financial Services Authority, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nWith regard to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the information I have obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original Chinese text is a formal title referring to the responsibilities of an audit committee under specific governmental or financial oversight bodies. The junior translators have attempted to render this into English, but their translations vary in accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct but lacks clarity in the relationship between the entities. It reads as if the Audit Committee is under both the Financial Management Officer and the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which may not be the intended structure.\nTranslation 2 misidentifies the Financial Management Officer as the \"Review Committee\" and incorrectly places the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee as the superior body to the Review Committee, which is not clear from the original text.\nTranslation 3 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Management Officer\" and similarly misplaces the structure of the oversight bodies.\nTranslation 4 is the most accurate in terms of identifying the \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" and the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" but it still lacks clarity in the relationship between the Audit Committee and these bodies.\nTranslation 5 and 6 both use \"Financial Controller\" and \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term. Additionally, the structure of the oversight bodies is not clearly conveyed.\nThe best possible translation should accurately reflect the original structure, using the correct title for the financial officer and clearly indicating the hierarchical relationship between the Audit Committee and the oversight bodies. It should also be concise and grammatically sound.\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer in preparing accurate financial statements in accordance with specific accounting standards and legal directives, while also ensuring internal controls are in place to prevent material misstatements.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of legal terminology. However, the phrase \"the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is clear and grammatically sound. However, it omits the reference to the Chief Executive's instructions, which is a critical component of the original text.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and well-structured. The use of \"it\" to refer to the Financial Management Officer is slightly ambiguous, but it is generally acceptable in formal writing.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Management Officer.\" This is a significant error, as the title is crucial in a legal context.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but it uses \"Exchange Fund Bill\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is incorrect. Additionally, the phrase \"financial management professionals\" is less precise than \"Financial Management Officer.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly identifies the \"Financial Management Officer,\" references the correct legal document (\"Exchange Fund Ordinance\"), and uses appropriate legal terminology. The structure is clear and the meaning is well-preserved.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the title \"Financial Management Officer,\" reference the correct legal document (\"Exchange Fund Ordinance\"), and use precise legal terminology. It should also be concise and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management officer must assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclose matters related to the going concern where applicable, and use the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward statement about the structure and responsibilities of a committee. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in terminology and style that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Audit Committee\" as being under the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" (with some using \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\").\n- The verb \"overseeing\" is used consistently, which is appropriate for describing the committee's role.\n- The use of \"Group’s financial reporting process\" is accurate and maintains the formal tone of the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Foreign Exchange Fund\" vs. \"Exchange Fund\":** The original uses \"外匯基金,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\" However, in some official contexts, \"Exchange Fund\" may be used as a shortened or established term. This is a matter of style and consistency with official terminology.\n- **Capitalization of \"Group\":** Some translations use \"Group\" with a capital letter, while others use it lowercase. This is a stylistic choice, but in formal or corporate contexts, \"Group\" is often capitalized when referring to a specific entity.\n- **\"Overseeing\" vs. \"supervising\":** While both are correct, \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal or corporate contexts to describe the monitoring of processes, making it a more natural choice.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** The first and third translations use \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" while the second, fifth, and sixth use \"Exchange Fund.\" This discrepancy could be due to different interpretations of the original term or lack of reference to official terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to:\n- Use the most accurate and consistent terminology, likely \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" based on the original.\n- Capitalize \"Group\" if it refers to a specific entity.\n- Use \"overseeing\" as it is more natural in formal corporate contexts.\n- Ensure consistency in capitalization and terminology across the translation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The original title, \"# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任,\" translates to \"The Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this title, each with slight differences in phrasing and grammatical structure.\nTranslation 1: \"The Responsibilities of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\" is grammatically correct and uses the plural form \"Responsibilities,\" which is appropriate if the text discusses multiple duties. However, the original Chinese uses the singular \"責任\" (responsibility), suggesting a more general or overarching duty.\nTranslation 2: \"The Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\" uses the possessive form \"Auditor’s,\" which is more specific than the plural \"Auditors.\" This may be appropriate if the text focuses on a single auditor, but the original is more general.\nTranslation 3: \"The responsibilities of an auditor in relation to the audit of financial statements\" is grammatically correct and uses the singular \"an auditor,\" which aligns with the singular \"責任\" in the original. However, the phrase \"in relation to\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nTranslation 4: \"The Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\" is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses the singular \"Responsibility\" and the plural \"Auditors,\" which may be slightly inconsistent, but it is still a strong translation.\nTranslation 5: \"# Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\" is nearly identical to Translation 4, except for the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol, which may be a formatting artifact and not part of the intended title.\nTranslation 6: \"Responsibilities of Auditors in Auditing Financial Statements\" uses the verb \"Auditing\" instead of \"the Audit,\" which is slightly different in tone and may be less formal.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use the singular \"Responsibility\" to match the original Chinese, and to use the plural \"Auditors\" to reflect the general professional role rather than a specific individual. The phrase \"in the audit of financial statements\" is more standard and formal than \"in auditing financial statements.\"\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be: \"The Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" This version is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns well with the original in both meaning and tone.\nThe Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Office, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error.\n\nUnderstanding internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls.\n\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n\nDetermine whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the financial management commissioner is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and\n\nPlan and execute group audits to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business units within the group, which serves as the basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and reviewing the audit work performed in connection with the group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, along with the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, each captures the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to professional accounting terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, it uses \"External Funds Advisory Committee\" instead of the more standard \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Also, the phrase \"I determine which matters are most important to the audit\" is slightly less formal than the original.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" correctly and \"public interest benefit\" is a precise term. However, \"will describe these matters in my auditor’s report\" is slightly less formal than the original's passive voice.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is slightly more specific than necessary. The phrase \"because there is a reasonable expectation\" is slightly wordy compared to the original's more concise phrasing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" correctly and \"public interest generated by such disclosure\" is a natural phrasing. However, \"I will determine which matters communicated with the Audit Committee\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is one of the most accurate translations. It uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"reasonable expectation\" as in the original. The structure is clear and professional, though \"in which case I decide not to communicate the matter in the report\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation introduces \"Review Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee,\" which is not present in the original text. This is a significant deviation and may mislead the reader. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the correct terminology (\"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\"), maintain the formal tone of the original, and ensure clarity and conciseness. It should also avoid unnecessary elaboration and ensure that the legal and professional nuances are preserved.\n**Improved Translation**:\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and thus constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless prohibited by law or regulation from disclosing a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that communicating a matter in my report would result in negative consequences that outweigh the public interest, in which case I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\nThe original title, \"# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註,\" is a heading for a section of financial documentation. The goal is to translate it into English in a way that is both accurate and consistent with standard financial terminology.\nReview of the translations:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"# Foreign Exchange Fund - Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the meaning of \"外匯基金\" as \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and \"財務報表附註\" as \"Notes to the Financial Statements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of a hashtag (#) is unnecessary unless it's part of a specific formatting requirement. It may be better to omit it unless it's used consistently in the document.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The phrase \"Notes to the Financial Statements\" is correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Exchange Fund\" is less precise than \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is the more commonly used term in financial contexts.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"# Exchange Fund - Financial Statements Notes\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Statements Notes\" is not the standard phrasing. The correct term is \"Notes to the Financial Statements.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"# Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is accurate and uses the standard financial terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is unnecessary unless required for formatting.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is the most accurate and natural translation. It avoids unnecessary formatting and uses standard financial terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None identified.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The term \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Notes to Financial Statements\" is missing the preposition \"the,\" which is standard in financial reporting.\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**  \nThe most accurate and natural translation is \"Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements.\" It uses the correct terminology, omits unnecessary formatting, and adheres to standard financial reporting conventions. The phrase \"Notes to the Financial Statements\" is the standard title used in financial documents, and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is the most precise and commonly used term for \"外匯基金.\" The hashtag (#) is not required unless it is part of a specific document format, and its inclusion may be misleading or unnecessary in this context.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all amounts are listed in millions of Hong Kong dollars.\n\n# 1 Main Business\n\nThe original text outlines the legal framework under which the Financial Management Officer manages the Exchange Fund, emphasizing the source of their authority and the Fund’s core functions. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, grammatical correctness, and precision of terminology.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically sound, but it misattributes the delegation of powers. It incorrectly states that the Financial Secretary delegates powers to the Financial Management Officer, whereas the original text indicates that the Financial Secretary himself acts as the Fund manager and confers powers on the Financial Management Officer.\n**Translation 2** is fluent and accurate in terms of content, but it uses “Financial Management Officers” (plural) instead of “Financial Management Officer” (singular), which may not align with the original text. It also uses “responsibility” instead of “functions,” which slightly alters the nuance.\n**Translation 3** is accurate and well-structured, correctly identifying the Financial Management Officer as the one exercising powers conferred by the Financial Secretary. It uses “main functions” and “soundness” appropriately, aligning well with the original.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in meaning and structure. It correctly identifies the source of authority and the Fund’s functions. However, it uses “Currency Fund Ordinance” instead of “Exchange Fund Ordinance,” which is a critical error in terminology.\n**Translation 5** misrepresents the role of the Financial Secretary, stating that the Financial Secretary manages the Fund directly, which contradicts the original text that states the Financial Management Officer is the one managing the Fund under the Financial Secretary’s authority.\n**Translation 6** is accurate in most respects but uses “safeguard” instead of “defend,” which is a minor stylistic choice. It also uses “systems” instead of “system,” which is slightly less precise.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Correctly identify the Financial Management Officer as the one managing the Fund, not the Financial Secretary.\n- Use the correct legal name: “Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).”\n- Use precise terminology such as “defend” and “soundness.”\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and clarity in sentence structure.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would accurately reflect the original text’s structure and meaning, using precise legal terminology and ensuring grammatical correctness.\nThe Fund is managed by the Financial Management Officer, who exercises powers conferred upon him by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the Fund Manager of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The Fund's main functions are to defend the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Style**: \n   - The use of \"portfolio\" is consistent across translations, but some variations in capitalization (e.g., \"Support Portfolio\" vs. \"support portfolio\") exist. Capitalization is more formal and appropriate in financial contexts.\n   - \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is correctly used in some translations, while others refer to \"currency board system\" or \"currency issue system.\" The correct term is \"currency board system\" in the context of Hong Kong's monetary framework.\n   - \"OECD\" is sometimes spelled out as \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,\" which is more formal and appropriate in official documents.\n2. **Grammar and Syntax**:\n   - Some translations use \"has been included\" or \"has been accounted for,\" which may imply a continuous or ongoing action, whereas the original text suggests a completed action. \"Are included\" or \"are accounted for\" is more accurate.\n   - The phrase \"which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government purchased\" is more concise and natural than \"which were purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).\"\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**:\n   - The term \"monetary base\" is correctly used in all translations, but \"monetary base\" is more precise than \"currency base\" or \"monetary foundation.\"\n   - The phrase \"included in the fund's accounts\" is more natural than \"accounted for in the fund's books\" or \"recorded in the fund's accounts.\"\n4. **Fluency and Readability**:\n   - Some translations use \"information on operating segments is presented in Note 31,\" which is more formal and appropriate than \"information about operating segments is included in Note 31.\"\n   - The use of \"debt and equity markets\" in one translation is less precise than \"bond and stock markets\" or \"bond and equity markets.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation should:\n- Use formal and consistent capitalization for portfolio names.\n- Accurately reflect Hong Kong's \"currency board system.\"\n- Use precise financial terminology such as \"monetary base\" and \"bond and stock markets.\"\n- Employ clear and concise phrasing, avoiding overly wordy constructions.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and natural flow in English.\n---\nThe fund’s assets are managed through four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. Under Hong Kong’s currency board system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched with the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, purchased by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government for strategic purposes and included in the fund’s accounts. Information on operating segments is presented in Note 31.\n"}
