{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

the Hong Kong Monetary Authority faced challenges head-on amid a complex external environment. Throughout the year, regional military conflicts continued, multiple countries held important elections, and the global economic outlook remained unclear, leading to ongoing volatility in the world situation. However, policymakers around the world sought an appropriate balance between controlling soaring inflation and supporting economic development, driving major economies to achieve resilient growth. Additionally, with the US launching its first interest rate cut in four years, together with a series of supportive economic policies introduced by Mainland China, market sentiment turned more optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains full of uncertainties.\n\nFaced with complex circumstances, our response strategy is to continue fully leveraging Hong Kong's role as a hub for offshore RMB business, fintech, and green and sustainable finance, as well as its unique advantages, to continue consolidating Hong Kong's leading status as an international financial centre. In 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority achieved significant progress in these key areas. Annual events such as the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" and other activities and initiatives received enthusiastic responses, fully demonstrating the international community's steadfast confidence in Hong Kong's prospects as an international financial centre.\n\nFacing the cyclical adjustment and structural transformation of Hong Kong's economy, we have closely collaborated with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviating their repayment burdens in a high interest rate environment while helping them sustain development. Together with a number of policy measures introduced by the Central Government and the Hong Kong SAR Government, Hong Kong's economy has achieved a steady recovery. In 2024, Hong Kong's economy recorded a moderate growth of 2.5%.\n\nAs we review the translations, several key observations emerge regarding translation quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness. All translations capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"geopolitical\" for \"地緣政治\" and \"supply chains\" for \"供應鏈.\"\n- The phrase \"global economy\" is consistently used for \"全球經濟.\"\n- The term \"trade protectionism\" is accurately used for \"貿易保護主義.\"\n- The translations effectively convey the idea of \"uncertainties\" and \"variables\" in the context of economic outlooks.\n- The use of \"intensify,\" \"exacerbate,\" and \"escalate\" for \"加劇\" and \"升溫\" is appropriate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"geopolitical politics\" instead of \"geopolitical situation,\" which is less idiomatic.\n- The first and fourth translations use \"Financial markets\" with a capital \"F,\" which is inconsistent with the lowercase \"financial markets\" used in other translations and is not standard in general English unless referring to a specific entity.\n- The first translation uses \"double impact\" instead of \"dual impact\" or \"double blow,\" which is less idiomatic in economic contexts.\n- The fourth translation uses \"stepping further into 2025,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic.\n- The first and fourth translations use \"prospects\" in a way that is less precise than \"economic outlooks\" or \"economic prospects.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"geopolitical situation\" consistently for \"地緣政治形勢.\"\n- Use \"global financial markets\" with lowercase \"financial\" for consistency and naturalness.\n- Use \"dual impact\" or \"double blow\" depending on the nuance intended.\n- Use \"economic outlook\" or \"economic prospects\" for \"經濟前景.\"\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used accurately and in context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nEntering 2025, the global economy continues to face numerous uncertainties amid a more complex geopolitical situation. The rise of trade protectionism and the increase in tariff barriers will lead to disruptions in global supply chains, intensify geopolitical economic fragmentation, and add more variables to the global economic outlook. Should geopolitical tensions further escalate, they may cause a dual impact on the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFaced with a complex and severe economic and financial environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will remain vigilant, faithfully fulfill our responsibilities, strive to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, and continuously consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. We will deepen our linkages with market participants, actively promote the development of emerging fields, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains its leading position in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: Resilient Cornerstone\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms provided. However, there are minor differences in capitalization and punctuation that affect the overall fluency and presentation of the title.\nThe term \"聯繫匯率制度\" is correctly translated as \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" in all translations, which is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary options. The term \"穩健基石\" is translated as \"Resilient Cornerstone\" in all translations, which is also accurate and fits well within the context.\nThe only notable difference is the use of a hash symbol (#) in the sixth translation, which is not present in the original text and may be an unnecessary addition. Additionally, the capitalization of \"Linked\" and \"Resilient\" in the first, third, and fifth translations is more consistent with title case, which is generally preferred for headings or titles.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the correct terminology, use title case for the heading, and avoid any unnecessary symbols or punctuation. Therefore, the improved translation would be:\nLinked Exchange Rate System: Resilient Cornerstone\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been implemented for over 40 years and has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, successfully withstanding the challenges posed by multiple economic and interest rate cycles, demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the US interest rate policy in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar money market continued to operate smoothly in accordance with the mechanism of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. In the first four months of the year, the exchange rate slightly weakened due to reduced liquidity, but subsequently strengthened gradually, approaching the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level by year-end. The stable exchange rate fully reflects the market's confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. At the same time, the Linked Exchange Rate System has continued to receive a high degree of recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System is built on our continued proactive efforts to explain to the public the operational mechanisms and advantages of the system, as well as rigorous market monitoring work. By collecting detailed data and combining advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies, we conduct more timely and comprehensive monitoring of the market and assessments of financial stability.\n\n# Banking System: Maintaining Resilience Amid Multiple Challenges\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong banking sector demonstrated strong resilience amid multiple macroeconomic challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining robust. At the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also robust, with the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, surpassing the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. Influenced by factors such as persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt issues in some mainland real estate companies, and a weak local commercial real estate market, the classified loan ratio rose to 1.96% by year-end. Due to banks adhering to prudent credit risk management and maintaining adequate provisions, the related risks remain overall manageable.\n\nWhile continuously monitoring banking credit risks, including those related to residential property mortgage loans, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented two rounds of adjustments to the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans in 2024 in response to changes in property market conditions and related risks in the banking sector. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratio and loan-to-income ratio limits for all residential properties have reverted to the levels prior to the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile all six translations capture the core message of the original text, they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"third-party\" for \"第三方\" and \"CrowdStrike global incident\" for \"CrowdStrike全球事故.\"\n- Most translations use \"operational resilience frameworks\" for \"運作穩健性架構\" and \"mapping and scenario testing\" for \"入配工作及情景測試.\"\n- The phrase \"critical business operations\" is consistently used for \"關鍵業務運作,\" which is appropriate.\n- The use of \"Hong Kong banking sector\" for \"香港銀行業\" is accurate and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"strive\" or \"strives\" for \"致力,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise. \"Committed to\" or \"dedicated to\" might be better.\n- \"Vulnerable links\" in Translation 6 is incorrect; the correct term from the dictionary is \"vulnerable session(s),\" but \"vulnerable links\" is more natural in context.\n- \"Vulnerable sessions\" in Translation 5 is awkward and likely a mistranslation of \"脆弱環節.\"\n- \"Robust frameworks\" is a good choice, but \"resilient frameworks\" is also acceptable and used in several translations.\n- \"Severe situations\" is a good translation for \"嚴重的情況,\" but \"severe incidents\" might be more precise in context.\n- \"Mapping and scenario testing\" is the correct translation for \"入配工作及情景測試,\" but some translations use \"mapping and scenario testing work,\" which is redundant.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"committed to\" for \"致力.\"\n- Use \"operational resilience frameworks\" for \"運作穩健性架構.\"\n- Use \"mapping and scenario testing\" for \"入配工作及情景測試.\"\n- Use \"critical business operations\" for \"關鍵業務運作.\"\n- Use \"vulnerable links\" or \"vulnerable sessions\" for \"脆弱環節,\" with \"vulnerable links\" being more natural.\n- Use \"severe incidents\" for \"嚴重的情況\" in context.\n- Ensure fluency and natural phrasing in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nWhile continuing to strengthen bank credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological resilience of banks to address the new challenges brought about by increasing reliance on third-party service providers. Taking the CrowdStrike global incident in July last year as an example, the incident highlighted that operational failures can cause serious cascading consequences in today’s highly interconnected global environment. Although the impact of the incident on Hong Kong’s banking sector was limited, it reflects the need to ensure that banks have established robust frameworks to maintain critical business operations even in the event of severe incidents. Encouragingly, all banks in Hong Kong have now established operational resilience frameworks and have already entered an important phase of mapping and scenario testing, identifying and addressing vulnerable links to ensure the continued operation of critical business functions.\n\nAt the same time, to respond to evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority focused last year on strengthening the banking sector's cyber defense capabilities, including issuing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulatory institutions to advance the cross-industry \"Cyber Mapping\" project, assessing and responding to systemic cyber risks that may arise from the interconnections among financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and technology service providers. After the trial phase in 2024, the project will be fully launched this year.\n\nAnother major challenge brought about by technological development is the escalating threat of financial fraud, which is becoming increasingly complex and requires joint efforts from banks, regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the public. We have already asked banks to further strengthen their online banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group) also expanded its coverage to include all major retail banks and six licensed stored value payment facility institutions, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of information exchange, with the amount of criminal proceeds confiscated also increasing accordingly. At the same time, the legislative amendment consultation on promoting information sharing among banks has received widespread support. This legislation will help further enhance banks' ability to detect and prevent financial crimes.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned measures, enhancing public awareness of suspicious transactions and self-protection is equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the \"Suspicious Account Alert\" mechanism and launched the \"Consumer Protection Against Fraud Charter 2.0,\" introducing more participating institutions to broaden the charter's protection network and further safeguard the public. At the same time, we also introduced the \"Smart Secure Deposit Service,\" allowing bank customers to choose to segregate part of their deposits, providing additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the various measures to assist customers in preventing scams, we also addressed the possibility of individual customers over-borrowing impulsively. Last year, we required retail banks to provide a minimum seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully reconsider and assess their financial responsibilities and repayment capabilities after entering into a loan agreement. Meanwhile, the \"Credit Information Sharing\" personal data infrastructure project was successfully launched last year, achieving significant progress in enhancing personal credit data services.\n\nIn addition to regulatory work, another key focus of our work in 2024 is to ensure credit supply to support the real economy, which is particularly important for SMEs, a vital pillar of Hong Kong's economy. Last year, we jointly launched the \"9+5\" support measures with the banking sector to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing to meet their working capital needs and to support their upgrading and transformation. Banks have made commitments not to require mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to repay early, nor to lower credit limits purely based on a decline in collateral value. As of now, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loan approvals, involving a total credit amount of HK$95 billion. Banks have also reserved approximately HK$39 billion in dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support the continued development of SMEs amid changing market conditions. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association jointly established the SME Financing Taskforce to provide support to SMEs at both the individual case and industry-wide levels. Given the current trade disputes and the uncertain outlook of the external economy, we introduced three additional support measures targeting specific industries in April 2025, further strengthening support for SMEs across multiple sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nIn maintaining the stability of the banking sector and enhancing its operational efficiency, we continue to promote the application of technology in the banking industry and actively accelerate the adoption of financial technology. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have already integrated financial technology into their day-to-day operations. Furthermore, given the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening risk management in the banking sector, preventing fraud, and enhancing customer experience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with Digital Hong Kong last year to launch the \"GenAI Sandbox,\" encouraging banks to apply GenAI responsibly. We have also issued guidelines to banks, clearly stipulating that if banks apply GenAI in customer-facing services, they must ensure customers receive adequate protection. In addition, the HKMA is actively utilizing GenAI technology internally to enhance analytical and supervisory efficiency. Beyond GenAI, we have also promoted collaboration and innovation in the fintech ecosystem by launching a new FiNETech series of events, establishing a matching platform called \"FintechConnect,\" and organizing a series of cross-industry exchange activities to strengthen the connections between financial services and the technology sector.\n\n# Strengthen Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nDespite 2024 being full of challenges and uncertainties, Hong Kong still maintains its leading status as an international financial centre, further expanding and enhancing its influence across various areas and internationally.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is a concise statement about Hong Kong's resilience and continued growth in 2024, despite challenges. The key terms to be translated accurately include \"地位\" (status, position, standing, role), \"更\" (further, more), \"充滿\" (challenging, full of), \"年\" (year), \"挑戰\" (challenge(s)), \"影響\" (impact, influence), \"多個\" (various, many), \"香港\" (Hong Kong), \"金融中心\" (financial centre), \"國際\" (international), \"仍\" (remain(s), still), \"持續\" (continued, continue), \"領域\" (areas, fields), \"穩\" (stable), \"提升\" (enhance, improve), \"拓展\" (expand, extend), and \"2024\" (2024).\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"presence\" which is not in the dictionary. \"Continuously expanding and enhancing\" is redundant and slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"enhancing its standing\" which is good. However, \"further enhancing\" is missing the nuance of \"in various areas and international influence.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"remains a leading international financial centre\" which is accurate. However, \"continues to expand and enhance its position\" is slightly vague and lacks the nuance of \"in various areas and international influence.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"maintains its leading position\" and \"continuously expanding and enhancing its influence across multiple areas and internationally.\" This is fluent and accurate, though \"across multiple areas and internationally\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"continues to maintain its leading position\" and \"further expanding and enhancing its presence in multiple areas and its international influence.\" This is accurate and fluent, though \"presence\" is not in the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"maintains its leading status\" and \"further enhancing and expanding in various areas and international influence.\" However, \"enhancing and expanding in\" is awkward and not idiomatic.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"status\" for \"地位,\" \"further\" for \"更,\" \"challenging\" for \"充滿,\" \"year\" for \"年,\" \"challenges\" for \"挑戰,\" \"influence\" for \"影響,\" \"various\" for \"多個,\" \"Hong Kong\" for \"香港,\" \"financial centre\" for \"金融中心,\" \"international\" for \"國際,\" \"still\" for \"仍,\" \"continued\" for \"持續,\" \"areas\" for \"領域,\" \"stable\" for \"穩,\" \"enhance\" for \"提升,\" \"expand\" for \"拓展,\" and \"2024\" for \"2024.\"\nThe final translation should be concise, fluent, and use the correct terms from the dictionary. It should also reflect the nuance of the original sentence, which emphasizes Hong Kong's resilience and continued growth in multiple areas and international influence.\n\nHong Kong plays an unparalleled and unique role as a vital bridge connecting Mainland China and international markets. By launching various favorable measures and strengthening collaboration with all parties, Hong Kong continuously consolidates and enhances its status as a regional hub for fintech and sustainable finance. For details on our specific work in green and sustainable finance, refer to the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Rapid growth in RMB business is deepening financial cooperation with the Mainland.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's Renminbi business continued to maintain strong momentum, recording significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly in offshore bank loans. The Renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement system set a new historical high for the daily average transaction value, reaching 310 billion yuan, reflecting the more prominent role of Hong Kong as the global offshore Renminbi business hub.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen the financial connectivity between Hong Kong and the Mainland. The \"Three Links and Three Facilitations\" policy launched in 2024, together with six new measures announced at the beginning of this year, have all achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a RMB 10 billion trade finance liquidity facility, providing banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funding to expand RMB trade finance services, thereby supporting the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through the Bond Connect \"Northbound\" as eligible collateral for the HKMA's RMB liquidity facility, the Hong Kong Offshore Clearing Company, and offshore RMB bond repurchase business, particularly onshore bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks. This innovative initiative has enhanced the appeal of onshore bonds to offshore investors, helping to promote greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. Last year, we also launched the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect 2.0,\" achieving multifaceted upgrades and optimizations, including offering a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and promotion arrangements, and expanded individual investment quotas. These measures not only reinforce Hong Kong's status as a global hub for offshore RMB business but also further strengthen our role as an important gateway connecting the Mainland with international markets.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports amid improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle. The labor market remained resilient, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures further eased. Hong Kong's stock market showed a significant rebound, while the property market remained largely weak due to market sentiment being pressured by the sustained high-interest rate environment. Given the ongoing escalation of trade tensions, it is expected that Hong Kong's economy will face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China's proactive introduction of economic stimulus measures, together with multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, should help consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international cooperation and deepen regional collaboration.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a financial or regulatory context. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體\" and \"remains\" for \"素維持.\"\n- The term \"resilient\" is a strong and appropriate choice for \"穩健.\"\n- \"Capital\" and \"liquidity\" are correctly translated, and \"robust\" is a suitable match for \"充裕.\"\n- \"Overall asset quality remains manageable\" is a consistent and accurate rendering of \"整體資產質素維持可控.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"all very robust\" which is grammatically awkward and stylistically unbalanced.\n- The second and third translations use \"being very robust\" which is redundant and less direct than \"are robust.\"\n- The fourth translation separates the clauses with \"and,\" which slightly disrupts the flow but is still acceptable.\n- The fifth translation uses \"the overall quality of assets\" which is slightly more wordy than \"overall asset quality.\"\n- The sixth translation is the most concise and grammatically sound, using \"capital and liquidity both robust\" which is a natural and idiomatic construction.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also use the most natural phrasing in English. The phrase \"capital and liquidity both robust\" from the sixth translation is the most idiomatic and concise. The use of \"overall asset quality remains manageable\" is consistent across several translations and is accurate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient, with capital and liquidity both robust, and the overall asset quality remains manageable.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding the direction of U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency markets have continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened during the first four months of 2024, then strengthened for the rest of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience in withstanding external shocks.\n\n# Banking sector stability\nThe original text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking system stability\" or \"Stability of the banking system.\" The dictionary provides several options for \"穩定\" (stability, stable, resilient, financial stability, soundness, safe and sound, integrity, stabilisation) and specifies that \"銀行體\" should be translated as \"banking sector.\"\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **\"Banking system stability\"** – This is a correct and natural translation. However, the dictionary specifies \"銀行體\" should be translated as \"banking sector,\" not \"banking system.\" This is a minor but important deviation.\n2. **\"Banking Sector Stability\"** – This translation uses the correct term \"banking sector\" from the dictionary and capitalizes \"Sector\" unnecessarily, which may be stylistically inconsistent with the original text's lowercase usage.\n3. **\"banking sector stability\"** – This is accurate and follows the dictionary's guidance. The only issue is the lowercase \"banking,\" which may not match the original's stylistic choice, but it is still a valid translation.\n4. **\"#BankingSectorStability\"** – This is a hashtag-style translation, which is not appropriate for a formal or standard translation. It lacks proper spacing and punctuation, making it unsuitable for most contexts.\n5. **\"Banking sector stability\"** – This is the same as translation 3 and is accurate and natural.\n6. **\"Banking sector stability\"** – Same as translation 5.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"banking sector\" as specified in the dictionary and maintain a natural, fluent structure. The lowercase \"banking sector stability\" is appropriate, but to match the original's use of a hashtag (the \"#\") and the capitalization of the term, a slightly adjusted version may be more consistent. However, since the original text is not a hashtag, it is better to present it in a standard format.\n**Improved translation:**\nBanking sector stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and translate key terms from the dictionary, such as \"支援\" as \"support,\" \"風險\" as \"risks,\" \"監管\" as \"regulatory,\" and \"生成式人工智能\" as \"Generative Artificial Intelligence.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning of the Chinese text.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"banking sector,\" \"cyber defense,\" and \"cross-industry initiatives.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"banking system\" instead of \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體,\" which is not the best match according to the dictionary.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"fintech\" for \"金融科技,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"financial technology.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"banking sector's operations\" instead of \"banking sector's operational resilience,\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"cybersecurity\" instead of \"cyber defense,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary's \"network\" and \"defence\" options.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"banking sector’s stability\" instead of \"banking system stability,\" which is not the best match for \"銀行體.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"bank-to-bank\" for \"跨行,\" which is not the best match for \"cross-industry\" or \"cross-sectoral.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"Financial technology\" is more precise than \"fintech\" in this context.\n- \"Cyber defense\" is more aligned with the dictionary's \"network\" and \"defence\" options.\n- \"Cross-industry\" is more appropriate than \"bank-to-bank\" for \"跨行.\"\n- The phrase \"enhance the operational resilience and cyber defense resilience of the banking sector\" is slightly redundant and can be streamlined.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based regulation and contingency planning, safeguarded the stability of the banking sector. It also provided regulatory guidance and support to the industry in responding to emerging risks, in order to enhance the operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector. To encourage the application of financial technology, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including the \"Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"consumer credit,\" \"Generative Artificial Intelligence,\" \"customer-facing,\" \"Wealth Management Connect,\" and \"digital asset-related activities.\"\n- Most translations maintain the structure and intent of the original text, particularly in conveying the initiatives taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- The use of terms like \"cooling-off period,\" \"guidance,\" and \"relaxed restrictions\" is consistent across translations, showing a good grasp of the core message.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistencies in terminology:** Some translations use \"SmartSafe Deposit\" or \"SmartSafe,\" while others use \"WiseSave\" or \"Smart Deposit.\" The dictionary lists \"智安存\" as \"SmartSafe,\" so this should be standardized.\n- **Ambiguity in \"Wealth Management Connect\":** Some translations use \"Wealth Management Connect\" while others use \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" or \"Wealth Management Connect (WMC).\" The dictionary lists \"理財通\" as \"Wealth Management Connect\" or \"WMC,\" so the full name should be used consistently.\n- **Inaccurate or unclear phrasing:** Phrases like \"completed the full transition of personal credit data services to 'Credit Information Link'\" or \"CreditGo\" are not in the dictionary and may not be official terms.\n- **Missing or misused terms:** \"信資通\" is translated as \"CreditGo\" or \"Credit Reference Service,\" but the dictionary lists \"信資通\" as \"Credit Information Link\" or \"Credit Reference Service.\" The most accurate term is \"Credit Information Link.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations are overly literal or awkward, such as \"working closely with the industry to provide one more Payment arrangement\" or \"enhanced the Pilot Scheme for Wealth Management Connect business.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Use \"SmartSafe\" for \"智安存\" and \"Wealth Management Connect\" for \"理財通.\"\n- **Clarity and natural phrasing:** Use natural English expressions such as \"introduced a cooling-off period\" and \"optimized the pilot scheme.\"\n- **Accuracy in official terms:** Use \"Credit Information Link\" for \"信資通\" and avoid non-dictionary terms like \"CreditGo.\"\n- **Fluency and readability:** Ensure the translation flows naturally in English, avoiding overly literal or awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the \"Consumer Protection Against Scams Charter 2.0,\" \"SmartSafe,\" and introduced a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products offered by banks, to enhance consumer protection in the banking sector. In addition, the HKMA provides guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services, and introduced an additional payment arrangement for secondary property transactions, working closely with the industry. The HKMA has also issued guidelines related to digital asset activities, optimized the pilot scheme for the Wealth Management Connect business, relaxed a number of restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit reference services to \"Credit Information Link.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays an important role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. By strengthening information exchange and cooperation through the public-private partnership platform, the number of suspicious transaction reports has significantly increased, thereby enabling more effective confiscation of criminal proceeds. The consultation on legislative amendments to promote information sharing by banks has received widespread support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes. In addition, the HKMA has issued guidelines to banks on the application of artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious activities and to prevent and disrupt authorized payment scams, and has optimized the \"suspicious account alert\" mechanism.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) progress in implementing international regulatory standards and enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"regulatory standards\" and \"enhanced to strengthen protection.\" It is fluent and accurate, but \"enhanced\" is less precise than \"optimized\" or \"upgraded\" for the context of improving a scheme.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"optimized\" and \"various aspects,\" which are appropriate. It is fluent and adheres well to the dictionary. However, \"in Hong Kong\" is redundant since the subject is already \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Scheme.\"\n3. **Third Translation:** Similar to the second, but uses \"Hong Kong's\" instead of \"the Hong Kong,\" which is more natural. It is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"etc.\" after \"disclosure,\" which is not necessary and slightly disrupts the flow. It is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"multiple areas\" and \"the protection for depositors.\" \"Multiple\" is less precise than \"various\" or \"several\" in this context. The rest is accurate.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"supervisory standards\" and \"enhanced.\" While \"supervisory\" is a valid translation for \"監管,\" \"regulatory\" is more commonly used in this context. \"Enhanced\" is acceptable but \"optimized\" or \"upgraded\" might be more precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"regulatory standards\" instead of \"supervisory standards\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"various aspects\" or \"several areas\" to reflect the nuance of \"多個範疇.\"\n- Use \"optimized\" or \"enhanced\" for \"優化,\" with \"enhanced\" being slightly more natural in this context.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"in Hong Kong\" when the subject already includes \"Hong Kong.\"\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure, in Hong Kong. In addition, various aspects of Hong Kong's Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution mechanism, implementing resolution standards and requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties, thereby reducing the risk of disorderly early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in formulating banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing barriers to resolution feasibility, and enhancing the capacity to execute resolutions.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"Wealth Management Connect,\" \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" \"RMB Liquidity,\" and \"offshore renminbi business hub.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"reinforce,\" \"gateway role,\" and \"global hub.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" (correct), but \"reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role\" is slightly less precise than \"reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role and consolidate its status.\"\n- **Translation 2** omits \"HKMA\" in the phrase \"HKMA's RMB Liquidity Arrangements,\" which is important for clarity.\n- **Translation 3** is the most comprehensive and accurate, using \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly translating \"reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role and consolidate its status.\"\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" instead of \"Cross-border,\" and \"Northbound Bond Connect\" instead of \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the best version, but it uses \"initiatives\" instead of \"measures\" and omits \"HKMA\" in one instance.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly uses \"Wealth Management Connect\" without the \"Cross-border\" qualifier and \"Northbound Bond Connect\" instead of \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms, such as \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\n- Include \"HKMA\" where appropriate for clarity.\n- Use \"reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role and consolidate its status as a global offshore RMB business hub\" for precision.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent English structure.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with relevant mainland and Hong Kong authorities to introduce a range of measures aimed at jointly deepening and expanding the connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland financial markets, including optimizing the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\"; expanding the eligible collateral scope for HKMA RMB liquidity arrangements and \"Northbound Swap Connect\" transactions; and optimizing the \"Northbound Swap Connect.\" These measures will help reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role and consolidate its status as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use terms from the dictionary, such as \"financial stability\" for \"穩定\", \"promote\" for \"促進\", and \"Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰\". However, some translations use \"financial centre\" instead of \"financial platform\", which is not the exact match for \"平台\" in the original text. The dictionary lists \"platform\" as an acceptable translation, so \"financial platform\" should be used.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some suffer from awkward phrasing. For example, \"the third Investment Summit\" should be \"the third 'Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit'\" to match the dictionary's \"Investment Summit\" and \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" options. Also, \"corporate treasury centres\" should be \"corporate treasury centres\" (with \"centres\" as per the dictionary).\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, but some use \"HKMA\" inconsistently. The dictionary includes \"HKMA\" as an option for \"香港\", so it should be used when referring to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n4. **Improvements**: The best translation should use \"financial platform\" consistently, include the full name of the summit when appropriate, and ensure that all dictionary terms are used accurately. It should also maintain a formal and professional tone, as expected in official communications.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of all versions while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and fluency in English.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made good progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s financial platform’s competitiveness, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach efforts to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, ensuring they fully understand the soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" and various other successful events have not only enhanced Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also created a positive ripple effect. In addition, the HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting the development of financial markets.\n\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in all areas of its \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the HKMA is closely collaborating with the People's Bank of China to promote the implementation of the linkage between Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) and the Mainland's interbank online payment clearing system, achieving cross-border payments.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nIn 2024, the global financial markets generally performed well, with major economies recording stable growth, and major central banks also gradually lowering policy interest rates as inflation moderated. Against this background, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues its efforts to promote asset diversification and responsible investment. Meanwhile, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintaining close connections with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and work. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to incorporate these.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator** uses \"Gold Corporation\" for \"金管局,\" which is incorrect. \"金管局\" refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not a gold corporation. This is a major error. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n2. **Second junior translator** correctly identifies \"金管局\" as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and uses \"close links\" for \"聯繫.\" The translation is accurate and natural, with proper use of \"enhance the public's understanding.\"\n3. **Third junior translator** uses \"linkages\" for \"聯繫\" and \"public and markets\" for \"社會及市場.\" While \"linkages\" is acceptable, \"public and markets\" misrepresents the original, which refers to \"society and the market.\" The phrase \"enhancing understanding\" is slightly less precise than \"enhance the public's understanding.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator** correctly identifies \"HKMA\" and uses \"close contact\" for \"聯繫.\" The translation is accurate and natural, with proper use of \"enhance the public's understanding.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator** uses \"linkages\" and \"public and markets,\" similar to the third. It also uses \"enhancing public understanding\" which is slightly less precise than \"enhance the public's understanding.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator** correctly identifies \"HKMA\" and uses \"close contact\" for \"聯繫.\" The translation is accurate and natural, with proper use of \"enhance the public's understanding.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify \"金管局\" as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- Use \"close contact\" or \"close links\" for \"聯繫.\"\n- Use \"society and the market\" rather than \"public and markets.\"\n- Use \"enhance the public's understanding\" for \"提升公眾對...的了解.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would incorporate the accuracy of the second, fourth, and sixth translations, while avoiding the misrepresentation of \"社會及市場\" as \"public and markets.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with society and the market through various channels to enhance the public's understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority strives to establish a flexible and professional workforce, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

Stability\n\n# September 16\n\nTo promote the development of the bond markets in Hong Kong and Macau, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Debt Securities Central Settlement System has established a direct link with the Central Securities Depository System under the Macau Monetary Authority.\n\n# October 25\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will increase the number of primary liquidity providers in the Hong Kong offshore RMB market to 11 banks, and increase the total amount of RMB liquidity available under the primary liquidity provider arrangement from 180 billion RMB to 200 billion RMB.\n\n# Banking Sector\nThe original text is \"# 銀行體系\" with a dictionary entry specifying that \"銀行體\" should be translated as \"banking sector.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, with the most notable differences being the use of \"system\" versus \"sector\" and the inclusion of a hashtag (#) in some translations.\nThe term \"銀行體系\" literally translates to \"banking system,\" but the dictionary specifies that \"銀行體\" should be translated as \"banking sector.\" This suggests that the intended translation is \"banking sector,\" not \"banking system.\" Additionally, the use of a hashtag (#) is not standard in formal English translations unless the text is intended for a specific format like a heading in a document or a social media post. Since the original text appears to be a heading or title, it is reasonable to retain the hashtag if it is stylistically appropriate.\nAmong the translations, the first, third, and fourth translators used \"banking sector\" without the hashtag, while the second and fourth used \"Banking Sector\" with a capital \"B\" and the hashtag. The fifth and sixth translators used \"Banking System,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary's specified translation.\nThe best translation should use \"banking sector\" as specified in the dictionary, retain the hashtag if it is stylistically appropriate, and ensure that the capitalization is consistent with standard English usage for headings. Therefore, the most accurate and stylistically appropriate translation is \"# Banking Sector.\"\n\n# Feb 7\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the report titled \"Digitalization of the Supervision of Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing: Where Now and the Way Forward,\" detailing how to strengthen and modernize anti-money laundering regulation.\n\n# Feb 20\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of two circulars to banks, providing guidance on the sale and distribution of tokenized products and the provision of digital asset custody services. The dictionary provides specific English alternatives for key terms, which must be used in the translation.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"circulars\" and \"guidance\" correctly. However, it uses \"respectively providing guidance on the sales and distribution\" which is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and grammatically correct. It uses \"the provision of digital asset custody services\" which is appropriate. However, it omits \"to banks\" which is present in the original text.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"record-keeping\" instead of \"custody,\" which is not the best fit for the term \"保管\" in this context. \"Custody\" is more appropriate for financial services.\n4. **Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"respectively\" correctly and \"custody services for digital assets\" is natural.\n5. **Translation 5** is grammatically correct but uses \"keeping services\" instead of \"custody services,\" which is less precise in a financial context.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"provides\" instead of \"issued\" for \"發出,\" which is incorrect. \"Provides\" is not the right verb for issuing a circular. Also, \"record-keeping\" is again used instead of \"custody.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently.\n- Use \"circulars\" for \"通告.\"\n- Use \"guidance\" or \"guidelines\" for \"指引.\"\n- Use \"custody\" for \"保管\" in the context of digital assets.\n- Include \"to banks\" as the original text specifies the recipients.\n- Use \"respectively\" to clarify that each circular addresses a different topic.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued two circulars to banks, respectively providing guidance on the sale and distribution of tokenized products and on the provision of digital asset custody services.\n\n# Feb 28\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and numerical accuracy that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the issuer of the guidance.\n- The term \"countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary entry for \"逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施.\"\n- The use of \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio\" or \"mortgage loan-to-value ratio\" is accurate and natural in financial contexts.\n- The term \"stress testing\" is correctly used for \"壓力測試,\" and \"basis points\" is correctly used for \"基點.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical errors:** Several translations incorrectly use \"HK$30 million\" instead of \"HK$3 million\" and \"HK$35 million\" instead of \"HK$3.5 million.\" This is a critical error that could mislead readers.\n- **Terminology inconsistency:** Some translations use \"guidelines\" while others use \"guidance,\" which are both acceptable, but should be consistent within a single translation.\n- **Redundancy and fluency:** Some translations are slightly wordy or repetitive, such as using \"raising the maximum mortgage ratio\" multiple times in the same sentence.\n- **Use of \"legislative changes\":** One translation incorrectly uses \"legislative changes\" for \"修訂,\" which is not appropriate in this context. \"Amendments\" or \"revisions\" would be more accurate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure numerical accuracy by using \"HK$3 million\" and \"HK$3.5 million\" as specified in the original text.\n- Maintain consistent terminology, such as using \"guidance\" or \"guidelines\" consistently throughout the translation.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, avoiding redundancy.\n- Replace \"legislative changes\" with \"revisions\" or \"amendments\" for accuracy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued guidelines to banks, adjusting countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures applicable to property mortgage loans and other related regulatory requirements. Key revisions include: (1) raising the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for self-occupied residential properties valued at HK$3 million or below to 70%; for self-occupied residential properties valued at HK$3.5 million or above to 60%; and for non-self-occupied residential properties to 60%; (2) raising the LTV ratio cap for non-residential properties to 70%; (3) raising the LTV ratio cap for property mortgage loans with \"asset level\" as the approval basis to 60%; and (4) suspending the requirement for stress testing of property mortgage loans assuming a 200 basis point increase in interest rates.\n\n# Feb 28\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement regarding the extension of application periods for specific credit guarantee products under a government scheme. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced varied results.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but has a grammatical issue: “SME financing Guarantee Scheme”’s “80% credit Guarantee Product” and “90% credit Guarantee Product” application period is extended to March 31, 2026. The possessive form “SME financing Guarantee Scheme”’s is awkward and should be rephrased. Also, the use of “application period is extended” is passive and less natural than active voice.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses active voice and correctly places the scheme name and products in the sentence. The phrase “has been extended” is appropriate for formal announcements. The use of “Credit Guarantee Product” with capitalization is consistent with the dictionary options.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate. The use of “application periods” is correct, and the phrase “are extended to the end of March 2026” is natural. However, the use of “Products” with capitalization may be inconsistent with the dictionary, which lists both singular and plural forms.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a very accurate translation. It uses the full name “Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme” as per the dictionary, which is more precise than “SME.” The phrase “has been extended until the end of March 2026” is natural and appropriate for formal announcements.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is problematic. It misplaces the scheme name and incorrectly uses “extend” as a verb without a subject. The structure is confusing and grammatically incorrect.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses the correct structure and active voice. The phrase “is extended until the end of March 2026” is natural and appropriate. The use of “Credit Guarantee Product” with capitalization is consistent with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name “Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme” as per the dictionary.\n- Use the correct term “Credit Guarantee Product” with capitalization.\n- Use active or passive voice appropriately for a formal announcement.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nUnder the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" the application period for the \"80% Credit Guarantee Product\" and the \"90% Credit Guarantee Product\" has been extended until the end of March 2026.\n\n# March 28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" has launched nine measures to support SMEs in obtaining bank financing and assist them in sustaining their development. These include not requiring mortgage customers to make early repayments; adjusting credit limits to provide customers with a minimum six-month transition period; and actively considering offering interest and fee waivers for SME customers in need.\n\n# April 1st\n\nIntroduce a 1% positive neutral countercyclical capital buffer.\n\n# April 10\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Banking Association (Banking Association) have launched the \"Consumer Protection Against Scams Charter 2.0,\" expanding the scope of the Charter to further assist the public in preventing credit card fraud and other digital scams. The Charter 2.0 has received full support from multiple government departments, financial regulatory bodies, and related institutions; more than 230 financial institutions and merchants from various industries have participated.\n\n# April 26th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"FiNETech Exchange\" for \"FiNETech匯\" and \"about 100\" for \"約100\". However, \"FiNETech Exchange\" may not be the most natural term in this context, and \"classification ledger technology\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA\" and \"gathering\" instead of \"event\" or \"series\". It also uses \"uncover\" for \"發掘\", which is less common in this context than \"explore\" or \"discover\".\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"Securities companies\" with a capital \"S\", which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"securities\" (lowercase). It also uses \"discover\" for \"發掘\", which is less natural than \"explore\" or \"uncover\".\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"event\" for \"首次FiNETech\" and \"about 100\" for \"約100\". It also uses \"classification technology\" instead of \"ledger technology\", which may not be as precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Securities companies\" with a capital \"S\", which is inconsistent. It also uses \"uncover\" for \"發掘\", which is less natural than \"explore\".\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" and \"about 100\" correctly. It also uses \"classification ledger technology\" for \"分類帳技術\", which is the most precise translation from the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"HKMA\" for consistency, \"about 100\" for \"約100\", and \"distributed classification ledger technology\" for \"分布式分類帳技術\". It should also use \"explore\" for \"發掘\" and \"cooperation arrangements\" for \"合作安排\". The term \"FiNETech\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA launched the FiNETech series to promote financial technology applications. The first FiNETech event brought together about 100 banks, securities companies, insurance companies, and technology enterprises to jointly explore advanced cooperation arrangements in wealth technology, insurance technology, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed classification ledger technology.\n\n# May 3\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a classification directory to support informed decision-making in green and sustainable finance and to promote the flow of green capital. The dictionary provides specific terms that must be translated with exact English equivalents.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" and \"industry practitioners\" from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"flow of green capital\" and \"basis for making decisions.\" However, it omits the term \"directory\" from the original, using \"taxonomy\" instead, which is acceptable but not exact.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"liquidity of green funds\" instead of \"flow of green capital,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term \"資金\" (funds\/capital). It also uses \"Classification Directory\" correctly, but \"liquidity\" is not the intended meaning here.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, with the same strengths and the same omission of \"directory\" in favor of \"taxonomy.\" It is fluent and accurate otherwise.\n4. **Translation 4** is the most accurate, using \"Classification Directory\" as per the dictionary and \"flow of green capital\" correctly. It also uses \"enable the industry\" and \"make informed decisions,\" which are natural and precise.\n5. **Translation 5** incorrectly combines \"Taxonomy\" and \"Directory\" into \"Taxonomy Directory,\" which is not a standard term. It also uses \"publishes\" in present tense, which is less appropriate for a published document.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"Classification Directory\" and \"flow of green capital\" correctly. It also uses \"enable the industry\" and \"make informed decisions,\" which are natural and precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Classification Directory\" as per the dictionary, use \"flow of green capital\" for \"資金,\" and use \"enable the industry\" or \"provide industry practitioners with a basis for making decisions.\" It should also use \"publish\" in the past tense to reflect the action of publishing a document.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA published the \"Hong Kong Sustainable Finance Classification Directory\" to enable the industry to make informed decisions when developing green and sustainable finance, and to promote the flow of green capital.\n\n# June 21\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局向銀行發出指引，加強保護消費者防範偽冒來電。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   *\"The Financial Supervisory Commission provides guidelines to banks to protect consumers and prevent fraudulent telephone calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"guidelines\" and \"fraudulent telephone calls\" accurately.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" is not the correct name for \"金管局\" (HKMA). Also, \"protect consumers and prevent\" is redundant; the original uses \"加強保護消費者防範\" which is more about strengthening protection against.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to enhance consumer protection against fraudulent telephone calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), uses \"issued guidelines\" and \"enhance consumer protection against fraudulent telephone calls\" effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"enhance\" is slightly less precise than \"strengthen\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"strengthen\" and \"fraudulent calls\" effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monetary Authority\" is too vague; \"HKMA\" is more specific and appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The banking sector provides guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection and prevent fraudulent telephone calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"strengthen\" and \"prevent\" well.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"banking sector provides guidelines to banks\" is illogical and redundant. The subject should be the authority, not the sector.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks to enhance consumer protection and prevent fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"enhance\" and \"prevent\" effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monetary Authority\" is vague; \"HKMA\" is more precise. Also, \"enhance\" is slightly less strong than \"strengthen.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   *\"The HKMA issues guidelines to banks to enhance consumer protection against fraudulent calls.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"fraudulent calls.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"enhance\" is slightly less strong than \"strengthen.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **\"金管局\"** should be translated as **\"HKMA\"** (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), which is the official name.\n- **\"發出指引\"** should be translated as **\"issued guidelines\"** or **\"provided guidelines\"**. \"Issued\" is more formal and appropriate for regulatory actions.\n- **\"加強保護消費者防範偽冒來電\"** should be translated as **\"strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent telephone calls\"**. \"Strengthen\" is more precise than \"enhance\" in this context, and \"fraudulent telephone calls\" is more specific than \"fraudulent calls.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA issued guidelines to banks to strengthen consumer protection against fraudulent telephone calls.\n\nOn the same day, the Banking Association launched the newly revised \"Voluntary Operational Guidelines for Person-to-Person Direct Telephone Promotion,\" optimizing the guidelines for the industry regarding telephone promotion activities.\n\n# June 24th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Banking Association, and the Hong Kong Chinese Banking Association co-organised the \"Banking Sector Support for SMEs Workshop,\" bringing together 200 representatives from the banking industry and chambers of commerce, as well as SME operators, to exchange opinions on the support measures and diversified services provided by the banking sector for SMEs.\n\n# June 25\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared its key priorities in combating fraud at the launch ceremony of the \"Celebrating the Return • SME Financial Services Entering the Community Special Lecture.\"\n\n# June 28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued two regulatory circulars to authorized institutions, reminding the industry to abide by all relevant legal and regulatory requirements when conducting pilot schemes for the cross-border transmission of credit information data.\n\n# July 3\n\nThe Legislative Council passed the \"Deposit Protection Scheme (Amendment) Ordinance 2024,\" implementing various enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme in two phases.

Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"suspicious account alert\" and \"automated teller machine (ATM) transactions.\" However, \"deposit machine transactions\" is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"deposit machines.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: The use of \"Association of Banks\" is not in the dictionary, and \"will be expanded to include online banking and teller transactions\" is slightly off in meaning compared to the original, which refers to \"cabinet transfers\" (teller transfers). Also, \"expand into\" is not the best fit for \"擴展.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"teller transfers\" correctly. However, \"deposit machines\" is slightly less precise than \"deposit-taking machines\" or \"cash deposit machines.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"ATM transactions (including deposit machines)\" effectively. However, it omits the mention of \"cabinet transfers\" (teller transfers) in the second sentence, which is present in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"teller transfers\" correctly and includes \"transactions at automated teller machines (including deposit machines)\" which is natural and precise. It also uses \"Hong Kong Banking Association\" which is not in the dictionary, but it is a reasonable interpretation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original, but \"banking Association\" is not in the dictionary, and \"suspicious account alerts\" (plural) is not the best match for the original, which uses the singular \"警示\" (alert). Also, \"cash deposit machine\" is slightly more specific than needed.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"可疑帳號警示\" should be \"suspicious account alert\" (singular).\n- \"網上銀行\" is \"online banking.\"\n- \"櫃位轉帳\" is \"teller transfers.\"\n- \"自動櫃員機（包括存鈔機）交易\" should be \"transactions at automated teller machines (including deposit machines).\"\n- \"12月\" is \"December.\"\n- \"聯同\" is best translated as \"in collaboration with.\"\n- \"銀行公會\" is \"Banking Association.\"\nBased on this, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fifth and third translations, ensuring accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Final Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Police Force (Police) and the Banking Association, announced that the coverage of the \"suspicious account alert\" mechanism will be expanded to include online banking and teller transfers. The scope of the alert mechanism was further expanded in December to include transactions at automated teller machines (including deposit machines).\n\nA range of enhanced measures to combat fraud were also simultaneously introduced, for example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, police, and the banking sector jointly established a mechanism to provide more timely and updated alerts regarding fake bank websites and telephone calls for the \"Anti-Scam Vigilance App.\"\n\n# August 2nd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared insights on measures to prevent and detect financial crimes at the \"2024 Financial Sector Anti-Money Laundering Workshop.\"\n\n# Aug 5\n\nThe Monetary Authority published a summary of the public consultation on the review of the three-tier banking system, with respondents broadly supporting the proposal to implement a new two-tier banking system.\n\n# August 6\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishing a report on virtual banks and the achievement of policy objectives related to their introduction. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"review report,\" which are acceptable. However, \"has achieved the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n2. **Translation 2:** Uses \"the HKMA has published a report reviewing virtual banks,\" which is grammatically correct. However, \"the development of virtual banks have already achieved\" is incorrect due to subject-verb agreement (\"development\" is singular, so \"has\" should be used).\n3. **Translation 3:** Uses \"issued a review report\" and \"has reached the three policy objectives.\" The use of \"reached\" is slightly less precise than \"achieved\" in this context. Also, \"HKMA\" is used without full name, which may be less formal.\n4. **Translation 4:** Uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a review report,\" which is more formal and complete. However, \"the development of virtual banks have already achieved\" is grammatically incorrect.\n5. **Translation 5:** Uses \"The HKMA has published a review report on virtual banks. According to the review results, the development of virtual banks has achieved the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\" This is grammatically correct and uses appropriate terminology. It is concise and clear.\n6. **Translation 6:** Uses the full name of the HKMA and includes the acronym in parentheses, which is more formal and appropriate. However, \"has already achieved\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name of the HKMA with the acronym in parentheses for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"published\" as the correct translation for \"發表\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Use \"review report\" for \"檢討報告\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Use \"development\" for \"發展\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Use \"policy objectives\" for \"政策目標\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Use \"introducing\" for \"引入\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published a review report on virtual banks. According to the review results, the development of virtual banks has achieved the three policy objectives of introducing virtual banks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority subsequently published a summary of public consultation on the proposal to rename \"virtual banks\" to \"digital banks\" in October.

It also encourages banks to explore the use of artificial intelligence to enhance consumer protection.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"GenAI\" appropriately. However, \"providing a set of guiding principles\" is slightly redundant, as \"guidelines\" already implies principles.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent but uses \"applying GenAI\" instead of \"application of GenAI,\" which is slightly less formal. It uses \"leverage\" effectively, which is a strong term in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2, with the same strengths and minor redundancy. It uses \"strengthen\" instead of \"enhance,\" which is slightly more forceful but still appropriate.\n4. **Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"HKMA.\" This is a critical error, as the original text clearly refers to the HKMA. It also uses \"Artificial Intelligence\" with a capital \"A,\" which is inconsistent with the lowercase \"genai\" in the original.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, using \"guidance\" and \"safeguard\" appropriately. It avoids redundancy and uses \"enhance\" effectively.\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses \"core principles\" and \"Artificial Intelligence\" with a capital \"A.\" However, it uses \"Protection\" with a capital \"P\" at the end, which is inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"GenAI\" with lowercase \"g\" and \"a\" as in the original.\n- Use \"guidelines\" or \"guidance\" appropriately.\n- Use \"safeguard\" or \"protect\" as appropriate.\n- Use \"leverage\" or \"use\" for \"利用.\"\n- Avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure consistency in capitalization and terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issues guidelines to banks on the application of GenAI, providing a set of principles to safeguard consumers. The HKMA also encourages banks to actively explore leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance consumer protection.\n\n# August 23\n\nThe original text discusses the establishment of a joint taskforce by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Banking Association to support SMEs at both the case and industry levels. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to incorporate these.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"further promote support for SMEs\" and correctly translating \"專責小組\" as \"Taskforce on SME Financing.\" It also correctly uses \"case and industry levels.\" However, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more commonly abbreviated as \"HKMA\" in formal contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is slightly awkward with \"to further promote and support the work of SMEs from individual cases and industry level(s).\" The phrase \"work of SMEs\" is not idiomatic in this context. Also, \"SMEs financing Taskforce\" should be \"SME Financing Taskforce.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Joint\" before the taskforce name is redundant, as \"jointly established\" already conveys the collaboration. Also, \"at the level of case and industry\" is awkward phrasing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version, using \"further promote support for SMEs' work\" and \"case and industry levels.\" However, \"SMEs' work\" is not the most natural phrasing in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is similar to the fourth but uses \"SME work\" instead of \"SMEs' work,\" which is slightly more natural. However, \"from case and industry levels\" is not the most idiomatic phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is concise but uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may be less formal than desired. Also, \"from individual cases and industry levels\" is awkward.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or the standard abbreviation \"HKMA.\"\n- Correctly use \"SME Financing Taskforce\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"further promote support for SMEs\" to reflect the nuance of the original.\n- Use \"at both the case and industry levels\" to accurately reflect the original's structure and meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Banking Association jointly established a \"SME Financing Taskforce\" to further promote support for SMEs at both the case and industry levels.\n\n# September 9\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a circular sharing the advantages of artificial intelligence in monitoring suspicious activities, as well as the measures taken by the authority to support and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence in the banking sector, including co-hosting a forum with Digital Hong Kong in November to share relevant experiences.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Affairs Oversight Committee (SFC) jointly issued a summary document on the joint consultation regarding the optimization of Hong Kong's over-the-counter derivatives reporting regime.

However, it uses \"will take effect\" which is slightly less formal than \"takes effect.\"\n**Translation 2** is also accurate and fluent, using \"specifying\" from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Basel III\" and \"gazetted.\" However, it uses \"Amendment\" instead of \"Amendments\" as in the original, which is a minor discrepancy.\n**Translation 3** has some issues. It uses \"specified\" instead of \"designating\" or \"specifying\" in the correct form. Also, \"Jan\" is used instead of \"January,\" which is less formal and less appropriate for a legal notice. The use of quotation marks around \"Basel III\" is inconsistent with the original.\n**Translation 4** is accurate and fluent, using \"designating\" correctly and \"Basel III Accord.\" However, it uses \"commencement date\" instead of \"effective date,\" which is a slight deviation from the original.\n**Translation 5** has several errors. It uses \"year\" instead of \"year\" in the title, which is incorrect. It also uses \"specified\" in the wrong form and \"in Hong Kong\" instead of \"in Hong Kong.\" The use of \"to be in Hong Kong\" is grammatically incorrect.\n**Translation 6** is concise but has some issues. It uses \"designates\" correctly but omits the word \"gazetted\" and uses \"effective date\" instead of \"date on which... takes effect,\" which is less precise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"Notice on the Effective Date of the 2023 Banking Sector (Capital) (Amendments) Rules 2024\" was gazetted, designating January 1, 2025, as the date on which the final reform package of Basel III takes effect in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 10th\n\nTo prevent payment card transaction fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks to further strengthen the security of online payment card transactions.

The key terms include \"金管局\" (HKMA), \"銀行\" (banks), \"指引\" (guidance), \"逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施\" (countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures), \"按揭貸款\" (mortgage loans), \"物業\" (property), \"上限\" (limit), and \"供款與入息比率\" (debt-to-income ratio).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"guidance\" correctly. The term \"loan-to-value ratio\" is accurate, but \"debt-to-income ratio\" is more commonly used than \"repayment-to-income ratio.\" The use of \"following amendments\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"guidelines.\" The term \"loan-to-value ratio\" is accurate, and \"debt-to-income ratio\" is appropriate. However, \"after revision\" is slightly less formal than \"after the revision.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"macroeconomic prudential\" instead of \"macroprudential,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"loan-to-income ratio\" is not the standard term for \"供款與入息比率.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"repayment-to-income ratio,\" which is not standard. \"Macro-prudential\" is correctly hyphenated, and \"cap\" is a good synonym for \"limit.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"repayment-to-income ratio,\" which is not standard. \"Upper limit\" is acceptable, but \"after revision\" is slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"guidelines\" and \"cap\" appropriately. \"Debt-to-income ratio\" is correct. The use of \"percent\" instead of \"per cent\" is acceptable in American English but may be less formal in British English.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" \"guidelines\" for \"指引,\" \"countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures\" for \"逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施,\" \"mortgage loans\" for \"按揭貸款,\" \"residential and non-residential properties\" for \"住宅物業和非住宅物業,\" \"loan-to-value ratio\" for \"按揭成數上限,\" and \"debt-to-income ratio\" for \"供款與入息比率.\" The phrase \"after the revision\" is more formal and appropriate than \"after revision.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines to banks, adjusting the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures applicable to property mortgage loans. After the revision, the loan-to-value ratio cap for all residential and non-residential properties is uniformly set at 70 percent, and the \"debt-to-income ratio\" cap is uniformly set at 50 percent.\n\n# October 16\n\nThe Government announced the launch of optimization measures for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for up to 12 months of \"interest-only repayment\" on existing and new loans. Additionally, the maximum loan guarantee period for 80% and 90% credit guarantee products has been extended to 10 years and 8 years respectively, and a \"partial principal repayment\" option is now available for new loans under the two guarantee products. These measures took effect on November 18.\n\n# 10月18日\nThe original text is a simple date: \"10月18日,\" which translates to \"October 18th\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating the characters \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), including \"month,\" \"month (date),\" \"Oct,\" \"day,\" and \"date.\" The numbers \"10\" and \"8\" are straightforward and should be translated as \"10\" and \"8\" respectively.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"October 18\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a correct and natural translation of the date. It uses the full month name and the day number, which is standard in English.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It omits the \"th\" in \"18th,\" which is not strictly necessary in all contexts but is commonly used in formal writing.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# October 18\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of the \"#\" symbol is consistent with the original text's formatting.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"th\" is missing, and the \"#\" is not typically used in English date formats unless it's part of a heading or title.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"Oct 18th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a concise and correct format, using the abbreviation \"Oct\" for October and including the \"th\" for the day.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"th\" is optional in informal contexts, but it's not incorrect.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# Oct 18\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"#\" matches the original formatting, and \"Oct 18\" is a standard date format.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"th\" is missing, and the \"#\" may be unnecessary unless it's part of a specific format.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"Oct 18\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a standard and concise format.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"th\" is missing, which may be considered less formal.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"Oct 18 day\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** It includes the word \"day,\" which is one of the dictionary options for \"日.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"Oct 18 day\" is not a standard English date format and is awkwardly phrased.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and consistent with standard English date formats. It should also respect the original formatting, which includes the \"#\" symbol. The most appropriate format would be **\"# October 18\"** or **\"# Oct 18\"**, depending on whether the full month name or the abbreviation is preferred. Since the dictionary includes both \"October\" and \"Oct\" as valid translations for \"月,\" either is acceptable. However, using the full month name (\"October\") is more formal and widely understood.\n### Final Translation:\n# October 18\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced five new measures in collaboration with the banking sector to support SMEs through capital and banking products and services. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (HKMA, banking sector, SMEs) and the main actions (launching measures, supporting SMEs, facilitating financing).\n- Most translations use appropriate terms from the dictionary, such as \"SMEs\" for \"企,\" \"capital\" for \"資本,\" and \"credit products\" for \"貸產品.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"further support the sustained development\" and \"exploring new business and markets,\" which are accurate but slightly less dynamic than alternatives.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"relaxing bank capital,\" which is not an exact match for \"釋放銀行資本\" (which should be \"releasing bank capital\"). It also uses \"setting aside dedicated funds,\" which is correct but could be more concise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"relaxing banking capital,\" which is again not an exact match for \"釋放銀行資本.\" It also uses \"exploring new business opportunities,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal, using \"releasing bank capital\" and \"launching more credit products and services.\" However, it uses \"from the aspects of capital and banking products and services,\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 5** is concise and accurate, using \"continuous development\" and \"expanding their business and markets.\" However, it omits the phrase \"from the perspectives of capital and banking products and services,\" which is important for context.\n- **Translation 6** has a grammatical error with \"relaxes bank capital\" (should be \"relaxing bank capital\") and uses \"pre-allocating dedicated funds,\" which is not the best match for \"預留專項資金\" (which should be \"reserving dedicated funds\").\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"releasing bank capital\" instead of \"relaxing bank capital\" for \"釋放銀行資本.\"\n- Use \"reserving dedicated funds\" for \"預留專項資金.\"\n- Use \"launching more credit products and services\" for \"推出更多協助中小企轉型的信貸產品及服務.\"\n- Ensure that the phrase \"from the perspectives of capital and banking products and services\" is included for completeness.\n- Use \"SMEs\" consistently for \"企\" and \"banking sector\" for \"銀行業.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the banking sector, has launched five new measures to further support SMEs' continued development and assist them in exploring new business opportunities and markets, from the perspectives of capital and banking products and services. These include releasing bank capital to facilitate SME financing needs, reserving dedicated funds to support SMEs, and launching more credit products and services to assist SMEs in their transformation.\n\n# October 28\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"cross-sectoral,\" \"one-stop assistance,\" and \"precise matching.\" It correctly uses \"foster\" for \"推動\" and \"ecosystem\" for \"生態.\" However, it uses \"further strengthening the platform to enhance cooperation\" which is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"cross-sectoral\" and \"one-stop service\" correctly. It uses \"incorporate\" for \"納入\" and \"enhancing collaboration\" for \"提升.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"Management Bureau\" for \"管理局,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is very similar to the second, with the exception of \"cross-industry\" instead of \"cross-sectoral.\" While \"cross-industry\" is acceptable, \"cross-sectoral\" is more precise in this context. It also uses \"joint growth\" for \"共同成長,\" which is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is slightly less fluent, with a run-on sentence in the second paragraph. It uses \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is less concise. It also uses \"further strengthen\" instead of \"further strengthening,\" which is grammatically incorrect.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation has several grammatical errors, such as \"aims to link financial institutions and fintech service providers\" (missing \"to\" after \"aims\") and \"platform one-stop support\" (incorrect structure). It also uses \"co-operation\" and \"co-operation\" inconsistently.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"cross-industry\" appropriately, \"incorporating\" for \"納入,\" and \"drive the joint growth\" for \"推動...共同成長.\" It also correctly uses \"Management Bureau\" for \"管理局.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement**:\n- Use \"cross-sectoral\" instead of \"cross-industry\" for \"跨行\" as it is more precise in the context of financial services.\n- Use \"fintech\" consistently instead of \"financial technology\" for brevity and industry standard.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness, such as using \"further strengthening\" instead of \"further strengthen.\"\n- Use \"drive the joint growth\" for \"推動...共同成長\" to maintain the nuance of collective progress.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"co-operation\" and \"collaboration.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the cross-sectoral fintech matching platform \"Fintech Connect,\" aiming to link financial institutions with fintech service providers. The platform offers a one-stop service to assist in the precise matching of fintech service supply and demand, promoting collaboration and innovation. The HKMA has partnered with the Shenzhen Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone Management Bureau, incorporating fintech service providers from Qianhai to further strengthen the platform, enhance cooperation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and drive the joint growth of the fintech ecosystem.\n\n# November 5th\nThe original text is a simple date: \"11月5日\", which translates to \"November 5th\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), including \"November\" for \"11月\" and \"5th\" or \"5\" for \"5日\". The most natural and fluent translation would be \"November 5th\", which is consistent with standard English date formatting. The use of \"5th\" is more appropriate than \"5\" in this context, as it reflects the ordinal nature of the day in the date. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly correct, but some variations exist in the use of \"5th\" versus \"5\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol, which is not necessary in this context. The best translation is \"November 5th\", which is concise, accurate, and follows standard English conventions for expressing dates.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issues guidelines to banks operating in the payment card issuance and acquiring business regarding direct payment card authorisation, to strengthen consumer protection when merchants temporarily suspend operations or cease business.\n\n# November 8\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introducing a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to promote responsible borrowing and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and uses the correct term \"cooling-off period.\" The verb tense is appropriate (\"is introducing\"), and the sentence structure is natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of \"HKMA.\" This is a critical error, as the original text refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not the Financial Services and Markets Commission. The rest of the translation is accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" and the correct verb tense (\"introduces\"). The sentence structure is natural and the terminology is consistent with the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"HKMA\" and the correct verb tense (\"introduces\"). The sentence is well-structured and the terminology is consistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but uses the past tense (\"introduced\") instead of the present tense. The original text does not specify a past action, so the present tense is more appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and concise, using the past tense (\"introduced\"). However, similar to the fifth translation, the use of the past tense may not be appropriate unless the action has already been completed.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct organization name (\"HKMA\"), the correct verb tense (present tense, as the action is ongoing or has been recently implemented), and maintain fluency and natural English structure. The third and fourth translations are the most accurate and concise, with the fourth being slightly more concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA introduces a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to promote responsible borrowing and reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing.\n\n# November 11th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Digital Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, and the Hong Kong Association of Mainland Chinese Banks co-hosted the \"SME Digital Technology Solutions Showcase Day.\" More than 100 participants, including SMEs from the catering and retail sectors, bank representatives, and technology solution providers, exchanged opinions on how the banking sector can support the digital transformation of SMEs through big data and technology; technology service companies also showcased various digital technology solutions designed for SMEs on-site.\n\n# November 13\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the Police, the Digital Policy Office, and the Banking Association, jointly organised a workshop to enhance the industry's awareness of deepfake technology scams and to share good practices in managing related risks.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2025 年工作重點及前瞻\n\n2025年環球經濟前景仍然不明朗，美國的經濟與貿易政策存在顯著的不確定性，加上美國通脹面對上行風險，以致市場憂慮美國政策利率的未來走向。與此同時，在中國內地公布及陸續推出經濟刺激措施後，內地與香港的市場氣氛改善，而政府推出的各項相關支持措施應可令訪港旅遊業進一步改善。香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局將繼續致力促進香港金融體系及基建的穩定與健全。面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，我們會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，我們會積極把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港的國際金融中心地位。我們會繼續謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 金融體系穩定健全\n\n在新一屆美國政府下，政策走向難以預料，並引致地緣經濟碎片化，因此預期全球經濟不明朗的情況應會在2025年持續。金管局肩負促進香港金融體系穩定健全的重任，將繼續提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，確保能掌握最新發展，並作好準備隨時為香港經濟提供支援。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n展望2025年，鑑於宏觀經濟環境不明朗，環球金融市場或會出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。我們亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，並評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n宏觀經濟環境的不確定性很可能會對銀行體系帶來挑戰。與此同時，數碼化的持續發展及生成式人工智能(GenAI)等創新科技的應用，既帶來眾多好處，亦不免為銀行增添新的業務操作與科技風險。面對上述環境，金管局將致力於透過提供政策與實務指引，以及與個別銀行以至整體業界的持續監管聯繫與溝通，進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會因應科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準與最佳做法，繼續加強及改進銀行規管架構與監管模式。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在信貸環境面臨壓力下，金管局將繼續重點監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估它們的信用風險管理手法的成效，特別是涉及貸款分類與撥備，以及問題貸款管理等範疇。同時，我們會與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，並鼓勵認可機構在維持審慎信用風險管理的首要原則下，繼續支持實體經濟。\n\n主要先進經濟體利率前景不明朗及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫，致使環球金融市場更趨波動，有見及此，金管局會繼續採取主動，監管認可機構的市場風險管理。因應宏觀經濟環境不明朗，以及銀行服務日益數碼化，我們亦會審視認可機構如何管理流動性風險，以加強它們應付突發性資金流的能力。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n金管局會繼續其提升銀行體系整體運作穩健性的工作，審視銀行在識別維持關鍵運作的潛在風險並作出補救方面的進度，以作為其實施運作穩健性架構的其中一部分。\n\n鑑於銀行業日益倚賴第三方服務供應商，金管局會進一步加強銀行對第三方風險的管理，制定新指引以實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所制定的相關國際標準。\n\n在網絡防衛韌性方面，金管局會透過跨界別的「網絡地圖」項目評估系統性網絡風險。該項目正由金管局聯同其他本地金融監管機構按照國際貨幣基金組織的建議共同推進。此外，我們將審視銀行實施「穩固三重數據備份」安排的情況及推出網絡防衛韌性測試框架，以推動銀行加強在遇到嚴峻網絡事故時恢復關鍵運作的能力。\n\n儘管我們留意到銀行業更廣泛採用GenAI等高端技術所帶來的好處，但亦會保持警覺，留意新生風險，並按需要就相關技術的運用提供指引。\n\n我們亦會與業界及其他相關持份者合作，保持機動應對，防患未然，以提升銀行打擊數碼詐騙及防範千變萬化的詐騙手法的能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2025年，金管局將推出制度改革、創新及其他措施，以提升香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈的整體能力、減低來自非法資金流的威脅，以及與最新的國際標準及最佳做法看齊。\n\n作為政府跨部門合作的一部分，我們將協助進行第三次香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的全面評估，以加深對科技發展所帶來的潛在弱點的了解，並根據評估結果制定有效且適度的指引，以配合新的穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。\n\n我們將會繼續在能帶來公眾價值的領域帶領及推廣負責任地應用科技，包括人工智能。相關工作包括加強可疑活動監察，讓銀行能識別及制止更多詐騙及傀儡戶口，從而進一步增加向執法機構提交的優質及有助作出跟進的情報。\n\n為加強打擊詐騙和其他金融罪行的力度，我們將提出所需的法例修訂建議，為銀行間分享個人戶口的訊息創造必要的途徑與保障。為加強偵測非法資金流的速度與數量，金管局將展開有關支付數據分析平台的工作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n在2025年，金管局會就認可機構在證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的操守進行現場及非現場審查。我們會重點留意高收益複雜產品、數碼資產及相關投資產品、「跨境理財通」業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，按需要就銷售證券、投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。為促進數碼資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，我們會繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為數碼資產行業制定穩健、周全和平衡的監管架構。\n\n此外，金管局會促進及監察業界實施「跨境理財通」優化措施的情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局聯繫，以進一步優化該計劃及其他銀行相關的跨境項目。\n\n我們亦會按需要整合及釐清有關財富管理及強積金相關業務的現行指引，讓業界更容易掌握金管局的監管規定，便利遵守。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案於2025年1月1日在香港生效。金管局將就最終改革方案在詮釋方面的常見問題持續向認可機構提供指引並加以釐清，以確保業界一致地採納該方案。\n\n巴塞爾委員會在2022年12月發出銀行審慎處理加密資產風險承擔的新標準，再於2024年7月發出具針對性修訂，進一步釐清穩定幣得到優惠監管待遇的準則。同時，巴塞爾委員會亦發表題為「加密資產風險承擔的披露」的文件，列載更新的加密資產風險承擔披露規定。為於香港實施相關標準，金管局會研究可能需要對《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）規則》、《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（《風險承擔限度規則》）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》等各套規則作出的法例修訂。金管局亦會因應實施經驗及業界回饋，對《風險承擔限度規則》提出若干優化建議。金管局將於2025年上半年就修訂進行法定諮詢，以能按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2026年1月1日實施新標準。金管局亦會制定相關銀行業申報表及輔助指引，以便利認可機構實施新標準。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為緊貼最新國際標準、監管方法及銀行業的發展，金管局計劃更新多個《監管政策手冊》單元，包括CA-G-5「監管審查程序」、CA-B-2「具系統重要性銀行」、IC-5「壓力測試」、IR-1「銀行帳內的利率風險」及IC-3「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」。《監管政策手冊》單元CR-G-13「對手方信用風險管理」會作出修訂，以反映巴塞爾委員會在2024年12月發出的「對手方信用風險管理指引」提出的穩健做法。\n\n# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\n\n巴塞爾委員會於2024年4月發出經修訂的《有效監管銀行業的主要原則》（《主要原則》）。經修訂《主要原則》反映自對上一次在2012年進行修訂以來監管與規管方面的發展，以及最近的結構性趨勢對銀行與銀行體系的影響。金管局將於2025年進行詳盡的自我評估，以確保其監管及規管架構符合經修訂《主要原則》。\n\n# 會計準則\n\n國際會計準則理事會計劃在2025年就動態風險管理(Dynamic Risk Management)發出徵求意見稿。金管局將與其他有關當局合作，就建議的動態風險管理會計模型對現行審慎監管規定的影響作出研究。\n\n# 執法\n\n金管局在2024年就擴大金融管理專員的調查及執法權力的建議諮詢銀行業，以確保他仍具備必要權力有效履行在《銀行業條例》下的職能。經考慮在諮詢中收到的意見後，金管局將調整有關建議，並制定必要的法例修訂，以進一步諮詢各持份者。\n\n# 處置機制\n\n金管局正繼續推行為期多年的項目，以建立運作暢順的認可機構處置機制。在2025年，金管局優先進行以下範疇的工作（表1）：\n\n表1 2025年處置機制的工作重點\n\n# 處置政策及標準\n\n- 就有關金管局對處置中的估值採取的方法，以及認可機構為支持適時穩健的處置估值而須具備的事前能力及安排的《實務守則》篇章進行諮詢，並完成相關制定工作\n- 推進制定處置重組的政策標準的工作\n\n# 國際及跨境合作\n\n- 參與國際處置政策發展及有效實施方面的工作，尤其金融穩定理事會透過轄下的處置機制督導小組及各工作小組計劃於2025年進行的12項處置機制改革措施\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms such as “withstand,” “buffers,” and “sufficient.” However, “should be able to further improve” is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some awkward phrasing, such as “resilient resilience,” which is redundant. Also, “policy interest rates” is not the best match for “利率” (interest rate), which is better translated as “policy rates.”\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate, with good use of dictionary terms. The phrase “leverage its robust resilience” is slightly more natural than “backed by the resilient resilience.”\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses “policy interest rates” instead of “policy rates,” which is not ideal. However, it is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is very strong, with natural phrasing and accurate use of dictionary terms. The phrase “resilient shock-absorbing capacity” is a good match for “穩健的抗震能力.” However, “built up over the years” is slightly more natural than “built over the years.”\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with good use of dictionary terms. However, “resilient shock resistance capabilities” is slightly awkward compared to “resilient resilience.”\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use “policy rates” instead of “policy interest rates” for “利率.”\n- Use “resilient resilience” or “robust resilience” for “穩健的抗震能力.”\n- Use “built up over the years” for “多年來所建立.”\n- Use “should further improve” instead of “should be able to further improve” for “應可令.”\n- Ensure consistency in the use of “Mainland China” and “Hong Kong.”\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe global economic prospects for 2025 remain uncertain, with significant uncertainty surrounding the US’s economic and trade policies, together with upward risks to inflation, leading to market concerns about the future direction of US policy rates. At the same time, following the announcement and gradual rollout of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, market sentiment in the Mainland and Hong Kong has improved, and the various related support measures introduced by the government should further improve the tourism industry in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s financial system, with its resilient resilience and robust buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"financial centre\" for \"金融中心.\" The use of \"Exchange Fund\" is consistent with the dictionary. However, \"strive to promote\" is slightly redundant, as \"strive to promote\" can be simplified to \"strive to promote\" or \"strive to enhance.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor variations in word choice. It uses \"integrity\" for \"健全\" and \"agility\" for \"靈活,\" which are both acceptable. The phrase \"respond to them with agility\" is slightly more natural than \"respond flexibly.\" However, \"financial centre status\" is slightly less natural than \"status as an international financial centre.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several grammatical errors, such as \"strives to promote\" (should be \"strive to promote\") and \"foreign exchange fund(s)\" instead of \"Exchange Fund.\" It also uses \"Financial Centre\" with a capital \"F,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"financial centre.\" The phrase \"strives to enhance\" is repeated, which is redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"seize\" for \"把握\" and \"enhance\" for \"提升,\" which are appropriate. The use of \"Exchange Fund\" is consistent with the dictionary. However, \"strive for promoting\" is slightly awkward and could be improved to \"strive to promote.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with natural phrasing and correct grammar. It uses \"seize\" for \"把握\" and \"financial center\" for \"金融中心,\" which are both appropriate. The phrase \"prudently and flexibly manage\" is well-structured and consistent with the dictionary. However, \"financial center\" should be \"financial centre\" to match British English conventions, as the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is typically associated with British English.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the fifth, with the exception of using \"foreign exchange fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund.\" This is a minor deviation from the dictionary, which lists \"Exchange Fund\" as a preferred term. The phrase \"ensure that the fund\" is slightly less formal than \"ensure that the Exchange Fund.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, \"financial centre\" for \"金融中心,\" and \"status\" for \"地位.\" It should also use natural phrasing such as \"seize opportunities\" and \"enhance the long-term investment returns.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strive to promote the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and infrastructure. Facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, seeking to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, we will actively seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. We will continue to prudently and flexibly manage the Exchange Fund. We will make appropriate defensive deployments, maintain high liquidity, and continuously diversify investments, striving to enhance the long-term investment returns of the Exchange Fund, ensuring that the Exchange Fund can continue to effectively maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Financial System Stability and Soundness\n\nUnder the new U.S. administration, policy directions are difficult to predict, leading to geopolitical economic fragmentation. Therefore, it is expected that the situation of global economic uncertainty will continue into 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) bears the responsibility of promoting the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system. It will continue to remain vigilant, prevent various potential risks, ensure it stays informed of the latest developments, and be ready to provide support to Hong Kong's economy at any time.\n\n# Stay vigilant to potential risks\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"monetary and financial systems\" and \"matters that affect Hong Kong's economy.\" It correctly uses \"assess\" for \"評估\" and \"measures\" for \"措施.\" However, it uses \"local and external risks and instability factors,\" which is slightly less precise than \"local and external environment's risks and instability factors.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the best version, using \"local and external environment\" and \"system(s).\" It also uses \"issues\" for \"事項,\" which is acceptable but \"matters\" might be more natural in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"assess\" for \"注視\" (which is incorrect; \"monitor\" is the correct translation), and \"destabilizing factors\" instead of \"instability factors.\" It also uses \"currency\" for \"貨幣,\" which is less appropriate than \"monetary\" in this context.\n4. **Translation 4** is very strong, using \"monitor risks and unstable factors in the local and external environments\" and \"monetary and financial systems.\" It also uses \"matters\" and \"assess\" correctly.\n5. **Translation 5** is nearly identical to Translation 4, with the same strengths and no notable weaknesses.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"issues\" for \"事項\" and \"related to these issues\" instead of \"matters,\" which is slightly less natural but still acceptable.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"monitor\" for \"注視\" instead of \"assess.\"\n- Use \"local and external environment\" to match the dictionary's \"environment\" and \"外圍.\"\n- Use \"monetary and financial systems\" for \"貨幣及金融體系.\"\n- Use \"matters\" for \"事項\" as it is more natural in this context.\n- Ensure \"評估\" is translated as \"assess\" or \"evaluate.\"\n- Use \"measures\" for \"措施.\"\n- Use \"stability\" for \"穩定\" as it is the most appropriate in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations while ensuring full adherence to the dictionary and natural English usage.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the risks and instability factors in the local and external environment, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems. We will also study matters that affect Hong Kong's economy and assess the potential risks related to these matters.\n\n# Maintain stability in the banking sector.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"resilience\" and \"supervisory engagement.\" However, it uses \"banking sector\" inconsistently, switching between \"banking sector\" and \"banks\" without clear reason.\n2. **Translation 2** is well-structured and uses \"enhance the resilience of banks against various shocks\" effectively. It also uses \"broader industry\" which is a good fit for \"整體業界.\" However, \"supervisory approaches\" is slightly vague compared to \"supervisory model.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"enhance the resilience of banks to withstand various shocks\" which is slightly redundant. It also uses \"expertise guidance\" instead of \"practical guidance,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary entry for \"實務指引.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is accurate and uses \"Financial Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a minor inconsistency. It also uses \"ongoing supervisory engagement\" which is appropriate.\n5. **Translation 5** is very close to the ideal version, using \"enhance the banking sector's ability to withstand various shocks\" and \"supervisory models.\" It also uses \"in line with\" which is a natural phrasing.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most consistent with the dictionary, using \"banking system\" for \"銀行體系\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for \"金管局.\" It also uses \"supervisory model\" and \"in line with\" effectively.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, consistent with the dictionary, and use natural English phrasing. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above, the best elements are:\n- Use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for \"金管局\"\n- Use of \"banking system\" for \"銀行體系\"\n- Use of \"enhance the resilience of banks to withstand various shocks\" for \"進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力\"\n- Use of \"supervisory model\" for \"監管模式\"\n- Use of \"in line with\" for \"因應\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. At the same time, the continued development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits, but also introduce new operational and technological risks to banks. In response to the above environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strive to further enhance the resilience of banks to withstand various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as maintaining continuous regulatory engagement and communication with individual banks and the broader industry. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen and improve the regulatory framework and supervisory model in line with technological developments, changes in customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priority\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original title, \"# 風險為本的監管重點,\" translates to \"Risk-Based Regulatory Priority\" when considering the dictionary terms and the natural flow in English. \nThe first junior translator's version, \"Risk-based regulatory priority,\" is concise and accurate, but lacks the hashtag symbol, which may be important for formatting or categorization purposes.\nThe second junior translator's version, \"Risk-based Regulatory Focus,\" is also accurate but uses \"Focus\" instead of \"Priority,\" which slightly changes the nuance. \"Priority\" better reflects the meaning of \"重點\" in this context.\nThe third junior translator's version, \"Risk-based supervisory regulation,\" is less accurate as \"supervisory regulation\" is not a direct match for \"監管重點.\"\nThe fourth junior translator's version, \"# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities,\" is accurate but uses the plural \"Priorities\" instead of the singular \"Priority,\" which may not be appropriate depending on the context.\nThe fifth junior translator's version, \"# Risk-Based Regulatory Focus,\" is similar to the second junior translator's version but again uses \"Focus\" instead of \"Priority.\"\nThe sixth junior translator's version, \"Risk-Based Supervisory Priority,\" is accurate but uses \"Supervisory\" instead of \"Regulatory,\" which is less appropriate in this context.\nConsidering all these translations, \"Risk-Based Regulatory Priority\" is the most accurate and natural translation of the original title, as it correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains the intended meaning and nuance.\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risks\n\nUnder pressure in the credit environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, particularly in areas involving loan classification and provisioning, as well as the management of problem loans. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, and encourage authorized institutions to continue supporting the real economy while maintaining the key principle of prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit some inconsistencies and minor errors that could be refined for clarity and precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"unclear prospects\" and \"heightened geopolitical tensions.\" The phrase \"take the initiative in supervising\" is natural. However, \"handle sudden capital flows\" is slightly less precise than \"cope with\" or \"manage.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very strong, with natural phrasing and accurate use of terms. The use of \"in light of this\" and \"increasing digitization\" is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"examine\" instead of \"review,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also very strong, with natural flow and accurate terminology. The phrase \"in view of this\" is slightly more formal than \"in light of this,\" but both are acceptable. The use of \"cope with\" is more idiomatic than \"handle.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. The use of \"greater volatility\" is slightly more formal than \"increased volatility,\" but both are correct. The phrase \"take proactive measures\" is well-chosen.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate, but it contains a clear error: \"to payable sudden capital flows\" is incorrect. \"Payable\" is not the correct translation for \"應付\" in this context. The intended term should be \"cope with\" or \"handle.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version has some grammatical issues, such as \"geopolitical tensions heat up\" (should be \"geopolitical tensions have heated up\") and \"handle sudden capital\" (incomplete phrase). The use of \"managing the market risks\" is less formal than \"supervise the management of market risks.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original text, use precise terminology, and ensure grammatical correctness. It should also reflect the nuances of the original, such as the emphasis on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's proactive role and the need to strengthen institutions' ability to manage liquidity risks.\n**Improved Translation**:\nUncertain interest rate prospects in major advanced economies, combined with heightened geopolitical tensions, have led to increased volatility in global financial markets. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to take proactive measures to supervise the management of market risks by authorized institutions. In light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitization of banking services, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risks to strengthen their ability to cope with sudden capital flows.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are a few points to consider for improvement. The term \"業務\" is translated as \"Business\" in all translations, which is appropriate. However, the dictionary provides \"tasks\" as an alternative, and in some contexts, \"tasks\" might be more suitable. However, in the context of \"業務操作\", \"Business Operations\" is more natural and commonly used.\nThe term \"科技\" is translated as \"Technology\" in all translations, which is correct. However, the dictionary provides several alternatives such as \"technological\", \"tech\", \"fintech\", \"technology-related\", \"technologies\", and \"Tech\". In this context, \"Technology\" is the most appropriate and natural choice.\nThe term \"風險\" is translated as \"Risks\" in all translations, which is correct. However, the dictionary provides several alternatives such as \"risk(s)\", \"financial stability risks\", and \"fraud risks\". In this context, \"Risks\" is the most appropriate and natural choice.\nThe use of the hash symbol \"#\" in translations 2 and 4 is not present in the original text, so it should be omitted.\nThe use of lowercase in translation 5 is not consistent with the original text, which uses uppercase for the title.\nThe use of \"tasks\" in translation 6 is not consistent with the original text, which uses \"業務\" which is more appropriately translated as \"Business\" rather than \"tasks\".\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Business Operations and Technology Risks\" without the hash symbol and with consistent capitalization.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking sector, reviewing the progress of banks in identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations and implementing remedial measures, as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking sector on third-party service providers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further strengthen banks' management of third-party risks by formulating new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).\n\nIn terms of cyber resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will assess systemic cyber risks through a cross-sectoral \"Cyber Mapping\" project. The project is currently being advanced by the HKMA in collaboration with other local financial regulatory institutions in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, we will review the implementation of \"robust triple data backup\" arrangements by banks and introduce a cyber resilience testing framework to promote banks' ability to recover critical operations in the event of severe cyber incidents.\n\nAlthough we recognize the benefits brought by the broader adoption of high-end technologies such as GenAI in the banking sector, we will remain vigilant, closely monitor emerging risks, and provide guidance on the use of relevant technologies as needed.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other relevant stakeholders to remain agile in response, prevent problems before they occur, and enhance the banking sector's capability to combat digital fraud and prevent ever-changing fraudulent methods.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will launch institutional reforms, innovation, and other measures to enhance Hong Kong's overall capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing ecosystems, reduce threats from illicit financial flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the Government’s inter-departmental collaboration, we will assist in conducting the third comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong, to deepen our understanding of the potential vulnerabilities brought about by technological development, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidance based on the assessment results, in line with the implementation of the new stablecoin issuer regulatory regime.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that bring public value. Related work includes strengthening the monitoring of suspicious activities, enabling banks to identify and disrupt more scams and puppet accounts, thereby further increasing the quality of intelligence submitted to law enforcement agencies, which will help in follow-up actions.\n\nTo strengthen the fight against scams and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendments to create the required channels and safeguards for sharing personal account information among banks. To improve the speed and volume of detecting illegal fund flows, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will launch initiatives related to a payment data analysis platform.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Related Business\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will conduct on-site and off-site reviews of the conduct of authorized institutions in relation to securities, investment products, trust, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related businesses. We will closely monitor high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" (WMC) business, digital distribution and consultation platforms, long-term insurance products, and premium financing business, and will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will also maintain close contact with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investment, insurance, and mandatory provident fund products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital asset industry, we will continue to collaborate with the government and other regulatory bodies to ensure the establishment of a robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will promote and monitor the implementation of optimization measures for the \"Wealth Management Connect\" and will continue to maintain contact with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to further optimize the plan and other cross-border banking-related projects.\n\nWe will also integrate and harmonise the existing guidelines related to wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fund-related business as needed, making it easier for industry practitioners to grasp the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory requirements and facilitating compliance.\n\n# Formulating Policy\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe Basel III final reform package will take effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to provide guidance and clarify common interpretive issues regarding the reform package to authorized institutions, ensuring consistent adoption by the industry.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is well-structured and accurate. It correctly uses \"prudential handling\" and \"preferential regulatory treatment.\" However, it uses \"risk exposure\" consistently, which is acceptable, though \"risk exposure\" is slightly more common than \"exposure to risk.\" It also correctly uses \"statutory consultation\" and \"authorized institutions.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"prudent management\" instead of \"prudential handling,\" which is slightly different but still acceptable. It uses \"exposure to crypto-assets\" and \"exposure limits,\" which are consistent with the dictionary. However, it uses \"among other sets of rules\" instead of \"etc.,\" which is slightly less formal.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is accurate and uses \"prudential treatment\" and \"exposure limits\" correctly. It uses \"enhancement recommendations\" instead of \"optimization recommendations,\" which is slightly different but still acceptable. It also uses \"in accordance with\" instead of \"in line with,\" which is a minor stylistic difference.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is accurate and uses \"prudential treatment\" and \"risk exposure\" consistently. It uses \"optimisation recommendations\" and \"supportive guidelines,\" which are consistent with the dictionary. However, it uses \"HKMA\" without the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in the first instance, which may be less formal.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and uses \"prudential handling\" and \"enhancements\" correctly. It uses \"statutory consultations\" and \"authorized institutions\" consistently. It also uses \"in accordance with\" and \"facilitate authorized institutions in implementing,\" which are natural and fluent.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is accurate and uses \"harmonise\" for \"釐,\" which is the correct dictionary term. It uses \"Limits on Exposure\" instead of \"Risk Exposure Limits,\" which is slightly different but still acceptable. It also uses \"supporting guidance\" and \"on 1 January 2026,\" which are natural and precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and consistent with the dictionary terms. It should use \"prudential treatment\" or \"prudential handling\" for \"審慎,\" \"risk exposure\" for \"風險承擔,\" \"preferential regulatory treatment\" for \"優惠監管待遇,\" and \"harmonise\" for \"釐.\" It should also use \"statutory consultation\" and \"authorized institutions\" consistently. Based on these considerations, the best translation would combine the strengths of the various versions, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\n---\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards for the prudential treatment of banks' risk exposure to crypto assets in December 2022, and further issued targeted amendments in July 2024 to harmonise the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. At the same time, the Basel Committee also published a document titled \"Disclosure of Crypto-Asset Risk Exposures,\" setting out updated disclosure requirements for crypto-asset risk exposures. To implement the relevant standards in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will study the legislative amendments that may be required to the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules (Risk Exposure Limits Rules), and Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose several enhancement recommendations to the Risk Exposure Limits Rules based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will conduct statutory consultation on the amendments in the first half of 2025, to implement the new standards on 1 January 2026, in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timeline. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking sector reporting forms and supporting guidelines to facilitate authorized institutions in implementing the new standards.\n\n# Other Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, regulatory approaches, and developments in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plans to update multiple modules of the \"Regulatory Policy Manual,\" including CA-G-5 \"Supervisory Review Procedures,\" CA-B-2 \"Systemically Important Banks,\" IC-5 \"Stress Testing,\" IR-1 \"Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book,\" and IC-3 \"Requirements for External Auditors of Authorized Institutions to Submit Reports under the Banking Ordinance.\" The module CR-G-13 \"Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" of the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" will be revised to reflect the robust practices outlined in the \"Guidance on Counterparty Credit Risk Management\" issued by the Basel Committee in December 2024.\n\n# The title \"巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\" translates to \"The Basel Committee's main principles for effective regulation of the banking sector.\" The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1: \"The Core Principles of Effective Supervisory Regulation of the Banking Sector by the Basel Committee\" is grammatically correct and uses \"supervisory regulation,\" which is a precise term. However, the placement of \"by the Basel Committee\" at the end makes the title slightly awkward.\nTranslation 2: \"# Core Principles for the Effective Supervision of the Banking Sector\" is concise and uses \"supervision,\" which is appropriate. However, it omits the Basel Committee entirely, which is a key part of the title.\nTranslation 3: \"The key supervisory principles for the Basel Committee’s banking sector\" is grammatically correct but lacks clarity. It implies that the Basel Committee has a banking sector, which is not accurate.\nTranslation 4: \"# The Basel Committee's main principles for effective regulatory oversight of the banking sector\" is well-structured and uses \"regulatory oversight,\" which is a strong term. It also includes the Basel Committee and the banking sector correctly.\nTranslation 5: \"Basel Committee’s key principles for the effective supervisory banking sector\" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. \"Supervisory banking sector\" is not a standard phrase.\nTranslation 6: \"The Basel Committee's Core Principles for Effective Supervision of the Banking Sector\" is well-structured and uses \"Core Principles\" and \"Effective Supervision,\" which are appropriate terms. It is concise and accurate.\nBased on this review, the best translation should include the Basel Committee, use appropriate terms like \"Core Principles\" and \"Effective Supervision,\" and maintain a clear and concise structure.\nThe improved translation is:\nThe Basel Committee's Core Principles for Effective Supervision of the Banking Sector\n\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised \"Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\" (the \"Core Principles\") in April 2024. The revised Core Principles reflect developments in regulation and supervision since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its regulatory and supervisory framework aligns with the revised Core Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an exposure draft on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will collaborate with other relevant authorities to conduct a study on the impact of the proposed Dynamic Risk Management accounting model on current prudential regulatory requirements.\n\n# Law Enforcement\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"banking sector\" as per the dictionary. The term \"Financial Management Commissioner\" is not in the dictionary, but \"Monetary Authority\" is, so it should be \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner.\" The use of \"ensure that he still has the necessary powers\" is slightly awkward, but overall, this is a strong translation.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"banking sector.\" However, it incorrectly refers to \"Monetary Authority's investigative and law enforcement powers\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner's.\" The term \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is not in the dictionary, but \"Monetary Authority\" is, so it should be simplified to \"Monetary Authority.\" The use of \"develop necessary legislative amendments\" is slightly less precise than \"formulate\" or \"draft.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some issues. It incorrectly refers to \"banking sector’s legislation\" instead of \"Banking Ordinance.\" It also uses \"it\" instead of \"he\" for the Monetary Authority, which is incorrect. The phrase \"to further consultation with stakeholders\" is awkwardly phrased.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"banking sector.\" It avoids the incorrect \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and uses \"prepare the necessary legislative amendments,\" which is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"it\" instead of \"he\" for the Monetary Authority, which is not a major issue but could be improved for clarity.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but includes the incorrect term \"Monetary Authority Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"he\" for the Monetary Authority, which is not appropriate. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"banking sector.\" It uses \"feedback\" for \"意見,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"to further consultation with stakeholders\" is awkwardly phrased, but otherwise, the translation is strong.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"Monetary Authority\" should be used consistently, as it is the correct translation for \"金管局\" in the dictionary.\n- \"Financial Management Commissioner\" is not in the dictionary, so it should be replaced with \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- \"意見\" should be translated as \"opinions\" or \"feedback,\" both of which are acceptable.\n- \"持份者\" should be translated as \"stakeholders.\"\n- \"法例修訂\" should be translated as \"legislative amendments.\"\n- The use of \"he\" for the Monetary Authority is incorrect; \"it\" should be used instead.\n- The phrase \"to further consultation with stakeholders\" should be rephrased for clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority consulted the banking sector in 2024 on recommendations to expand its investigative and enforcement powers, to ensure it still has the necessary powers to effectively perform its functions under the Banking Ordinance. After considering the opinions received during the consultation, the Monetary Authority will adjust the relevant recommendations and formulate the necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Resolution Mechanism\n\nThe HKMA is continuing to implement a multi-year project to establish a smooth and efficient mechanism for the resolution of authorized institutions. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritize the following areas of work (Table 1):\n\nTable 1: Work Priorities of the 2025 Disposal Mechanism\n\n# Disposal Policies and Standards\n\n- Conduct consultation on the chapter of the Code of Practice relating to the methods adopted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in valuing assets under disposal, and the prior capabilities and arrangements that authorized institutions must have in order to support timely and prudent valuation of disposals, and complete the related formulation work  \n- Advance the work of formulating policy standards for disposal restructuring.\n\n# International and cross-border cooperation\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines, but there are subtle differences in style and formatting that can be refined for clarity and consistency. \nThe first translation, \"International and cross-border collaboration,\" uses \"collaboration\" which is a valid translation for \"合作\" and is grammatically correct. However, \"collaboration\" is more abstract and less commonly used in formal titles compared to \"cooperation.\"\nThe second and fifth translations, \"International and Cross-border Cooperation,\" use \"Cooperation\" with a capital \"C,\" which is acceptable in titles but may be inconsistent with the lowercase \"cross-border\" in the same phrase. Additionally, \"Cooperation\" is a noun, while \"合作\" can also be a verb, so the choice of noun form is appropriate here.\nThe third translation, \"International and Cross-Border Cooperation,\" capitalizes \"Cross-Border\" and uses \"Cooperation\" with a capital \"C.\" This is consistent in style but may be overly formal for a title unless that is the intended tone.\nThe fourth translation, \"# International and Cross-border Collaboration,\" includes a hashtag, which is not present in the original text and may be an unnecessary addition unless the context specifically requires it.\nThe sixth translation, \"International and cross-border cooperation,\" is the most neutral and consistent in terms of capitalization and word choice. It uses \"cooperation\" in lowercase, which is appropriate for a title unless a specific style guide dictates otherwise.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"International and cross-border cooperation,\" as it is grammatically correct, consistent in style, and accurately reflects the original Chinese text without unnecessary stylistic embellishments.\n\nParticipate in work related to the development and effective implementation of international resolution policies, particularly the Financial Stability Board’s initiatives through its resolution mechanism steering group and various working groups, which have planned 12 measures for the reform of resolution mechanisms to be implemented by 2025.\n"}

Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong's central banking institution, with four main functions.\n\n- Maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;  \n- Promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking sector);  \n- Assisting in consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and  \n- Managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Statutory Authorization\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly known as the Legislative Council) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly known as the Financial Secretary) to appoint the Monetary Authority. The Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"set out\" for \"明文規定.\" However, it incorrectly uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and omits \"Financial Management\" from the title. It also uses \"discloses\" instead of \"disclosed\" for \"披露,\" which is grammatically inconsistent with the past tense.\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"delegated\" for \"轉授.\" It also uses \"disclosed\" in the correct past tense. However, it uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary, which may be a discrepancy.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some issues. It uses \"Exchange Fund Bill\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" and \"Resolution Regime\" instead of \"Resolution Mechanism.\" It also uses \"will delegate\" instead of \"delegated,\" which is inconsistent with the past tense.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is inaccurate. It incorrectly translates \"金融管理專員\" as \"Financial Secretary\" and \"司長將\" as \"Secretary to the Financial Secretary.\" It also misrepresents the relationship between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"disclosed\" in the correct past tense. It also uses \"explicitly stipulated\" for \"明文規定,\" which is a strong and appropriate choice.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"disclosed\" in the correct past tense. It also uses \"HKMA\" for \"金管局,\" which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" as per the dictionary, use \"delegated\" for \"轉授,\" and \"disclosed\" in the correct past tense. It should also use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" for \"外匯基金條例.\" The fifth and sixth translations are the most accurate and fluent, with the sixth being slightly more concise and using \"HKMA\" appropriately.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are explicitly set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other related ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, set out the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs, and also disclosed that the Financial Secretary delegated certain powers to the Monetary Authority. The aforementioned letters are public documents and can be accessed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary's specified terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"exchange value\" for \"匯價,\" both of which are appropriate. However, it uses \"monetary and financial system\" which is slightly redundant, as \"monetary\" already implies financial aspects.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent but uses \"position\" for \"地位,\" which is less precise than \"status\" in this context. It also uses \"financial centre\" with a lowercase \"f,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Financial Centre.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"exchange value\" for \"匯價.\" It also uses \"soundness\" for \"健全,\" which is appropriate. However, it repeats \"Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily.\n4. **Translation 4** is grammatically sound and uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"exchange value\" for \"匯價.\" It also uses \"integrity\" for \"健全,\" which is acceptable. However, it uses \"with a view to\" for \"藉此,\" which is slightly less idiomatic than \"thereby.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is similar to Translation 3 but uses \"with a view to\" for \"藉此,\" which is less natural than \"thereby.\" It also uses \"integrity\" for \"健全,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n6. **Translation 6** has a grammatical error (\"require\" should be \"requires\") and omits \"monetary\" from \"monetary and financial system,\" which is important for clarity. It also uses \"position\" for \"地位,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"status\" for \"地位,\" \"exchange value\" for \"匯價,\" \"stability\" and \"soundness\" for \"穩定\" and \"健全,\" and \"with a view to\" or \"thereby\" for \"藉此.\" It should also use \"Financial Centre\" with a capital \"F\" as per the dictionary and ensure grammatical correctness and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and the Financial Secretary has control over it. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall mainly be used to influence the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system (while at the same time taking into account the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund), thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe original text outlines the appointment and role of the Monetary Authority under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, as well as its designation as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its leadership structure. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Financial Secretary.\" However, it incorrectly states that the Monetary Authority is \"appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance\" without specifying that the Monetary Authority is the \"Monetary Authority Commissioner.\" Also, the term \"HKMA\" is not used, which is a common abbreviation.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation introduces the term \"Monetary Authority Commissioner,\" which is not in the dictionary. The dictionary lists \"專員\" as \"Monetary Authority,\" not \"Monetary Authority Commissioner.\" The use of \"executing other Ordinances\" is also incorrect, as \"Ordinances\" are not functions to be executed.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly states that the Monetary Authority is appointed by the \"Chief Executive,\" which is not mentioned in the original text. It also uses \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the term.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is concise but lacks clarity in the first sentence. It uses \"to assist the Financial Secretary in the execution of functions granted to him under the Ordinance,\" which is grammatically awkward. It also fails to clearly state that the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Financial Secretary.\" However, it repeats \"Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily and fails to use the abbreviation \"HKMA.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"HKMA,\" and clearly states that the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA. However, it incorrectly states that the Monetary Authority executes \"functions assigned by other ordinances,\" which is not supported by the original text.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary.\n- Correctly identify the Monetary Authority as the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation for clarity.\n- Avoid introducing terms not in the dictionary, such as \"Monetary Authority Commissioner.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in executing the functions conferred upon him under that Ordinance, as well as the functions assigned by other Ordinances and the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"vested with responsibilities and powers\" and \"deposit-taking business\" correctly. It also uses \"handling the authorization matters\" as per the dictionary. However, \"restricted-license banks\" is not an exact match for the original term \"有限制牌照銀行,\" which should be \"banks with restricted licenses\" or \"restricted license banks.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This version uses \"taking deposit business,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic. \"Taking deposit\" is not a standard phrase in English. It also uses \"banks with restricted licenses,\" which is acceptable, but \"taking deposit business\" is a clear weakness.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is more verbose and includes \"conferred upon it,\" which is unnecessarily wordy. It also uses \"authorized institutions accepting deposits in Hong Kong,\" which is slightly off from the original, which refers to \"接受存款公司\" (deposit-taking companies), not \"authorized institutions.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong,\" which aligns well with the dictionary. It also uses \"authorization matters relating to,\" which is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This is very similar to the fourth, but it uses \"restricted licensed banks,\" which is not an exact match for \"有限制牌照銀行.\" The correct phrasing would be \"banks with restricted licenses.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This is the most accurate in terms of dictionary adherence. It uses \"licensed banks in Hong Kong, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies,\" which is precise. However, it omits the word \"authorized\" in \"authorization matters,\" which is present in the original and should be included.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should use \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員,\" \"banking business\" for \"銀行業務,\" \"deposit-taking business\" for \"接受存款業務,\" \"licensed banks\" for \"持牌銀行,\" \"banks with restricted licenses\" for \"有限制牌照銀行,\" \"deposit-taking companies\" for \"接受存款公司,\" and \"authorization matters\" for \"認可事宜.\" It should also use \"vested with responsibilities and powers\" for \"根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority, vested with responsibilities and powers under the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking business and deposit-taking business. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling authorization matters concerning licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for entities in the banking sector. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to conduct orderly resolution of banking sector entities that are operating unsustainably (the failure of such entities may pose systemic risks), for maintaining financial stability, while seeking to safeguard public funds.\n\nThe original sentence is a legal statement that outlines the legal authority granted to the Monetary Authority under two specific ordinances. The sentence structure is formal and precise, and the translation must reflect this tone and accuracy.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"vested\" for \"賦予\" and \"Mandatory Provident Fund\" for \"強制性公積金\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Bank securities\" is ambiguous and not a standard term. \"Fund businesses\" is not a direct match for \"金業務\" and may confuse readers.  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"grant\" for \"賦予\" and \"mandatory provident fund schemes\" for \"強制性公積金計劃\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Banking securities\" is not a standard term. The phrase \"mandatory provident fund schemes\" is overly wordy and not the most direct translation of \"強制性公積金計劃\".  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"vested\" and \"Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Bank securities\" is still ambiguous, and \"fund businesses\" is redundant and unclear.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"vest\" correctly and lists \"banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund businesses\" clearly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fund businesses\" is still not a standard term and may be confusing.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"vest\" and \"relating to\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Vest certain powers upon\" is awkward phrasing. \"Fund businesses\" is still unclear.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"vested\" and \"banking, securities, and Mandatory Provident Fund businesses\" clearly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fund businesses\" is still not a standard term and may be confusing.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"vested\" for \"賦予\" as it is the most formal and legal term. \"Banking\" is the best translation for \"銀行\" in this context, and \"securities\" is the correct term for \"證券\". \"Mandatory Provident Fund businesses\" is the most accurate and concise translation for \"強制性公積金業務\", avoiding the redundancy of \"fund businesses\". The phrase \"relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund businesses\" is clear, precise, and maintains the formal tone of the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance vest the Monetary Authority with certain powers relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund businesses.\n\nThe Insurance Authority, in accordance with the Insurance Ordinance, has delegated to the Monetary Authority the powers of inspection and investigation over the insurance-related businesses of banks.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal text that outlines the authority granted to the Monetary Authority under a specific ordinance. The key elements include the name of the ordinance, the authority granted, the subject (banks), and the specific obligations (customer due diligence and record-keeping).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance\" and \"record-keeping.\" The phrase \"supervise banks in maintaining compliance\" is natural and conveys the intended meaning.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Terrorist Financing\" instead of \"Counter-Terrorist Financing\" is slightly less precise. Also, \"maintain the requirements\" is awkward phrasing compared to \"maintaining compliance.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The term \"regulate\" is less precise than \"supervise\" in this context. Also, \"due diligence review\" is not a standard term; \"due diligence\" alone is sufficient.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation introduces \"customers’ bank account data,\" which is not in the original text. It also uses \"due diligence examination,\" which is redundant and not standard.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The phrase \"Financing of Terrorists\" is less common than \"Terrorist Financing.\" Also, \"due diligence on customers\" is slightly awkward compared to \"customer due diligence.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"regulate\" but \"supervise\" might be more appropriate. The phrase \"in their compliance\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance\" as it is the most standard and precise term. \"Supervise\" is more appropriate than \"regulate\" in the context of oversight. \"Customer due diligence\" is the standard term, and \"record-keeping\" is the correct translation for \"存紀錄.\" The phrase \"maintaining compliance\" is natural and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance authorizes the Monetary Authority to supervise banks in maintaining compliance with the provisions relating to customer due diligence and record-keeping under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposits Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority responsibility to provide assistance in the operations of the Deposit Protection Scheme, and to initiate the payment of compensation to depositors of licensed banks that have failed from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key term \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and use \"statutory framework\" for \"法定架構.\"\n- The term \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"支付系統及儲值支付工具條例.\"\n- The translations generally use \"licensing regime\" for \"發牌制度\" and \"monitoring\" or \"monitor\" for \"監察.\"\n- The phrase \"used to store monetary value\" is well-received and accurately reflects \"用作儲存金錢價值.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"specified\" for \"指定,\" which is acceptable, but \"designated\" might be more precise in a regulatory context.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"designate\" for \"指定,\" which is appropriate, but the use of \"authorises\" (British spelling) may be inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"specified\" as a verb (\"specified and monitor\") instead of \"specify,\" and misplaces \"used to store monetary value and meet the Standards\" as if it modifies the licensing regime rather than the tools.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Ordinance on Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments,\" which is not an exact match for the original title and may be misleading.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"specify\" for \"指定,\" \"meet the criteria\" for \"符合指明準則,\" and correctly placing the phrase \"used to store monetary value and meeting the criteria.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"designate\" for \"指定\" as it is more formal and commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance\" for \"符合該條例指明準則.\"\n- Ensure that \"electronic and physical 'tools'\" is correctly placed and that the phrase \"used to store monetary value\" is clearly associated with the tools.\n- Maintain consistency in spelling (e.g., \"authorizes\" vs. \"authorises\").\n- Use \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" as the exact title.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority may, under the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, designate and monitor certain important clearing and settlement systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. The Ordinance also authorizes the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for electronic and physical \"tools\" used to store monetary value and meeting the criteria specified in the Ordinance.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n\n- 建立了一套清晰的機構管治架構；\n- 維持高問責性及透明度，並與各持份者保持緊密聯繫；及\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準。\n\n金管局的管治架構涵蓋幾個主要部分，包括給予意見和指導的各法定諮詢委員會、問責性與透明度，以及內部監控與外部審計。\n\n# 金管局與特區政府\n\n金管局是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及管理層\n\n# 諮詢委員會\n\n諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》成立，就與財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權相關的事宜向其提供意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員各以本身的專業知識及經驗獲得委任，使外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下設有五個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定範疇的工作和給予意見，並透過諮詢委員會向財政政司長報告及提出建議。有關外匯基金諮詢委員會及其轄下五個專責委員會的詳情，請參閱第53至63頁。\n\n銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會就有關《銀行業條例》，特別是有關銀行、接受存款公司及有限制牌照銀行經營銀行業務或接受存款業務（視屬何情況而定）的事宜，向香港特別行政區行政長官提供意見。兩個委員會均由財政司司長擔任主席，成員包括金融管理專員及財政司司長根據行政長官的授權而委任的人士。有關銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會的詳情，請參閱第64至65頁。\n\n# 管理層\n\n總裁委員會由金管局總裁、副總裁及其他高層人員組成，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。總裁委員會定期開會，向總裁匯報金管局各部門主要工作的進度，並就與金管局運作有關的政策事項向總裁提供意見。有關總裁委員會成員名單，請參閱第66至67頁。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n# 與公眾溝通\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局亦盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項，尤其透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n此外，金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放六日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能一章（第185至191頁）。\n\n# 立法會\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年三次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。金管局總裁定期在財經事務委員會作出的簡報載於金管局網站。\n\n此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 資訊披露\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演講辭及簡報會資料文件。\n\n金管局不時檢討外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的披露是否足夠。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n# 內部監控與外部審計\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和匯報各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) commitment to good governance in maintaining public confidence in its statutory responsibilities. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as Hong Kong's central banking institution.\n- The phrase \"good governance\" is consistently used, which aligns with the term \"管治\" translated as \"governance.\"\n- The use of \"statutory responsibilities\" is accurate for \"法定職責.\"\n- The translations all convey the HKMA's commitment to maintaining public confidence, which is a key message of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"institutional governance\" instead of \"corporate governance\" or \"governance,\" which is acceptable but less specific than \"corporate governance\" in the context of an organization like the HKMA.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"the public's confidence and trust,\" which is slightly redundant and not present in the original text.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"safeguarding\" instead of \"maintaining,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"the Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less direct.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"central bank institutions\" instead of \"central banking institution,\" which is slightly off in singular\/plural form.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Public\" with a capital \"P,\" which is not appropriate unless referring to a specific entity or title.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"corporate governance\" instead of \"institutional governance\" to align with the term \"機構管治\" and the dictionary's suggestion of \"corporate.\"\n- Ensure consistency in referring to the HKMA using \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" without unnecessary variation.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"confidence and trust,\" unless explicitly stated in the original.\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used accurately, such as \"statutory\" for \"法定\" and \"corporate\" for \"機構.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as Hong Kong’s central banking institution, deeply understands the importance of good governance to maintain public confidence in the HKMA’s fulfillment of its statutory responsibilities, and therefore continues its efforts to adhere to high standards of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfill the commitment to good institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\n- Established a well-defined corporate governance framework;  \n- Maintained high accountability and transparency, and maintained close links with all stakeholders; and  \n- Implemented refined and robust monitoring measures to manage risks, and ensured that the behaviours of staff at all levels and their day-to-day operations meet the specified standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's governance framework covers several key components, including statutory advisory committees that provide advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, as well as internal controls and external audits.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the SAR Government\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China, but may appoint staff under employment terms different from those of civil servants, in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officials. The HKMA's day-to-day operations enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that the Monetary Authority shall maintain currency stability through the currency issuance system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority shall be responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including determining related strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Affairs and the Treasury, has responsibility for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system, as well as preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority's responsibilities include:\n\n- Promote the overall stability and effective operations of the banking sector;  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;  \n- Handle matters related to the issuance and circulation of statutory banknotes and coins;  \n- Promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems, and where appropriate, be responsible for operating such systems; and  \n- Cooperate with other relevant institutions and organisations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implement appropriate market development measures to assist in strengthening the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority shall be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Management Levels\n\n# Advisory Committees\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the main areas of work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of \"Advisory Committee\" and \"guidance.\" Properly uses \"main areas of work.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Introduces \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" without being in the original text. The original only mentions \"金管局\" (HKMA), which is not explicitly named in the sentence.  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: \"諮詢委員會\" → \"Advisory Committee\" ✅; \"意見\" → \"advice\" ✅; \"範疇\" → \"areas\" ✅; \"指導\" → \"guidance\" ✅; \"給予\" → \"provides\" ✅.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main work areas.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Similar to Translation 1, with fluent structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same issue of adding \"Hong Kong\" to \"Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: All terms match dictionary options ✅.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide advice and guidance on the Financial Services and Markets Authority’s main areas of work.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Advisory Committees\" as per dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly replaces \"金管局\" (HKMA) with \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the same entity.  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: \"諮詢委員會\" → \"Advisory Committees\" ✅; \"意見\" → \"advice\" ✅; \"範疇\" → \"areas\" ✅; \"指導\" → \"guidance\" ✅; \"給予\" → \"provide\" ✅.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"Advisory Committees provide advice and guidance on the main areas of work of the Monetary Authority.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Advisory Committees\" and \"Monetary Authority\" (a common abbreviation for HKMA).  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monetary Authority\" is not the full name of \"金管局\" (HKMA), but it is acceptable in context.  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: All terms match dictionary options ✅.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the HKMA’s main areas of work.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"HKMA\" as a recognized abbreviation for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None. This is a concise and accurate translation.  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: All terms match dictionary options ✅.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the main work areas of the Gold Authority.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" and \"guidance.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Gold Authority\" instead of \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Dictionary Check**: \"金\" → \"gold\" ❌ (misused in this context); \"範疇\" → \"areas\" ✅; \"指導\" → \"guidance\" ✅; \"給予\" → \"provide\" ✅.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Advisory Committee\" or \"Advisory Committees\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the correct abbreviation for \"金管局.\"\n- Avoid adding unnecessary details like \"Hong Kong\" or misinterpreting \"金\" as \"gold.\"\n- Use \"main areas of work\" or \"main work areas\" as appropriate.\n### Final Translation:\n**The Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the HKMA’s main areas of work.**\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Financial Secretary\" as per the dictionary. However, \"Monetary Authority\" is used in some translations, while \"HKMA\" appears in one. The dictionary lists \"Monetary Authority\" as the correct term, so \"HKMA\" should be avoided unless it is an acronym already established in the text.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations vary in fluency. The first and third translations are more natural in flow, while the second and fourth translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"on authority from the Chief Executive\" or \"in their personal capacity with the authorization.\"\n3. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: The term \"使\" is translated as \"enabling\" or \"thereby greatly benefiting,\" which is acceptable. However, the dictionary lists \"to\" or \"enable\" as options, and \"enable\" is more direct. \"給予\" is translated as \"providing advice\" or \"providing advice,\" which is correct. \"委任\" is translated as \"appointed\" or \"appointing,\" which is accurate.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, using formal and official language suitable for a government document.\n5. **Structural Clarity**: The third and fourth translations are the clearest in structure, with well-organized sentences and logical flow. The fifth translation incorrectly refers to \"Monetary Authority Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to provide advice to the Financial Secretary on matters related to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex-officio Chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary, with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, in their personal capacity. Each member is appointed based on their own professional knowledge and experience, thereby greatly benefiting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees under its jurisdiction, responsible for monitoring the work of the Monetary Authority in specific areas and providing advice, and reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Advisory Committee. For details regarding the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five specialized committees, please refer to pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation uses \"Deposittaking\" as a compound term, which is not standard in English. It also uses \"Special relating to\" incorrectly, and the phrase \"See pages 64 to 65\" is not properly capitalized or formatted.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly uses \"deposit-taking\" as a hyphenated term, and it accurately reflects the structure and meaning of the original text. The use of \"particularly concerning the operation of banking business or deposit-taking business\" is natural and precise.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation uses \"Banking Business Advisory Committees\" (plural) when the original text refers to \"two committees,\" which is slightly inconsistent. It also uses \"Chief Executive’s empowering authorization,\" which is awkward and less precise than \"under the authority of the Chief Executive.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This is very close to the second translation and is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business (as applicable)\" which is a natural and precise phrasing. It also correctly uses \"persons\" instead of \"individuals\" in a formal context.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation uses \"Consultative Committee\" instead of \"Advisory Committee,\" which is not one of the dictionary options. It also uses \"Deposit-Taking\" with a hyphen, which is acceptable but not as standard as \"deposit-taking.\" The phrase \"upon authorization from the Chief Executive\" is slightly awkward compared to \"under the authority of the Chief Executive.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is very similar to the second and fourth translations. It uses \"accepting deposit business\" instead of \"taking deposits,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"Deposittaking\" without a hyphen, which is not standard.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe second and fourth translations are the most accurate and fluent. They correctly use \"deposit-taking\" as a hyphenated term, accurately reflect the structure of the original text, and use natural English phrasing. The fourth translation is slightly more polished in terms of phrasing and consistency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Banking Business Advisory Committee and the Deposit-taking Companies Advisory Committee provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on matters relating to the Banking Ordinance, particularly concerning the conduct of banking business or deposit-taking business (as applicable) by banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted license banks. Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, with members including the Monetary Authority and individuals appointed by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive. For further details on the Banking Business Advisory Committee and the Deposit-taking Companies Advisory Committee, see pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management Level\nThe original text is \"# 管理層\", which translates to \"Management Level\" or \"Management Levels\" depending on context. The dictionary provides several options for \"管理\" (management, managing, governance, etc.) and \"層\" (level, levels). The use of a hashtag (#) in the original text suggests it may be a heading or title, likely in a document or list.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"Management Level\"** – This is a direct and accurate translation. It uses \"Management\" from the dictionary and \"Level\" for \"層\". It is grammatically correct and fluent.\n2. **\"# Management\"** – This translation omits \"層\" entirely, which is a key part of the original phrase. It also retains the hashtag, which is appropriate if the text is a heading. However, it is incomplete.\n3. **\"Management\"** – This translation omits \"層\" and is therefore incomplete. It may be acceptable in certain contexts, but it does not fully reflect the original phrase.\n4. **\"# ManagementLevel\"** – This translation combines \"Management\" and \"Level\" without a space, which is not standard in English. It is also grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.\n5. **\"Management\"** – Same as translation 3, it omits \"層\" and is incomplete.\n6. **\"Management\"** – Same as translations 3 and 5, it is incomplete.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include both \"管理\" and \"層\" as they are both key components of the original phrase. The hashtag (#) should be retained if it is part of the original formatting. \"Management Level\" is the most accurate and fluent translation that includes both components and adheres to English grammar and formatting standards. It is concise, clear, and respects the original structure.\n\nThe Chief Executive Committee is composed of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Deputy Chief Executive, and other senior staff, with the Chief Executive of the HKMA serving as Chair. The Chief Executive Committee meets regularly to report to the Chief Executive on the progress of the main work of the HKMA’s departments and to provide advice to the Chief Executive on policy matters related to the operations of the HKMA. For the list of members of the Chief Executive Committee, see pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) autonomy in its day-to-day operations and policy implementation, while also highlighting its accountability and transparency. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and structure that affect clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"methods adopted\" for \"採用的方法\" and \"day-to-day operations\" for \"日常運作.\"\n- The phrase \"high degree of autonomy\" is consistently used for \"高度自主,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"government policy objectives\" is well translated for \"政府政策目標,\" capturing both the policy and the goal aspect.\n- The use of \"complemented by high accountability and transparency\" is consistent across translations and accurately reflects \"並同時輔以高問責性及透明度.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Government\" with a capital \"G,\" which may be inconsistent with the context unless referring to a specific entity.\n- The phrase \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more formal and precise than \"the Monetary Authority\" or \"the HKMA,\" though all are acceptable.\n- The use of \"is complemented by\" versus \"complemented by\" is a minor grammatical nuance, but \"complemented by\" is more concise and natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for consistency and formality.\n- Use \"complemented by\" without \"is\" for a more concise and natural flow.\n- Ensure \"government\" is lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nIn terms of the methods adopted for day-to-day operations and implementing government policy objectives, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy, complemented by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using appropriate terms like \"accountable to the public\" and \"enhance transparency.\" It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Legislative Council.\" However, it uses \"broader responsibilities\" without specifying the exact term from the dictionary, which should be \"further\" or \"more.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"responsible to the public\" instead of \"accountable to the public,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"determined by legislation\" correctly.\n3. **Translation 3** has some issues, such as using \"Public\" with a capital \"P\" inconsistently and using \"individuals\" instead of \"public\" in \"issues of concern to individuals,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"efforts to enhance transparency,\" which is less natural than \"strives to enhance transparency.\"\n4. **Translation 4** introduces \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. It uses \"members of the public\" instead of \"public,\" which is slightly more specific but not incorrect. It also uses \"strives to enhance transparency,\" which is natural.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Monetary Authority,\" which is more specific but not required by the dictionary. It also uses \"personnel\" instead of \"public,\" which is incorrect. It uses \"more extensive responsibility\" correctly.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"accountable to the public\" correctly, \"broader responsibilities\" with \"further\" implied, and \"matters of concern to the public\" correctly. It also uses \"strives to enhance transparency\" naturally.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"Monetary Authority\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"accountable to the public\" instead of \"responsible to the public\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"public\" consistently, not \"individuals\" or \"personnel.\"\n- Use \"further\" or \"more\" for \"更\" depending on context.\n- Use \"day-to-day\" for \"日常.\"\n- Use \"enhance\" for \"提高.\"\n- Use \"execution\" or \"implementation\" for \"執行.\"\n- Use \"legislation\" for \"法律.\"\n- Use \"legislative\" or \"Legislative Council\" for \"立法.\"\n- Use \"responsibility\" or \"responsibilities\" for \"責任.\"\n- Use \"closely monitor\" for \"留意.\"\n- Use \"objectives\" for \"目標.\"\n- Use \"through\" for \"透過.\"\n- Use \"policy\" for \"政策.\"\n- Use \"open (to the public)\" for \"開放.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the translations, ensuring all dictionary terms are used correctly and the English is natural and fluent.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Monetary Authority is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the powers of the Monetary Authority are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the Monetary Authority is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The Monetary Authority also recognises that it bears further responsibilities, promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring matters of concern to the public. In carrying out its day-to-day work and maintaining extensive links with society, the Monetary Authority remains committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n\n- In the first translation, the structure is clear and the terms are mostly correctly translated. However, \"statutory limitations on market sensitivity\" is slightly awkward. \"Ensure that the financial community and the public have a thorough understanding\" is good, but \"thorough understanding\" could be more natural as \"full understanding.\" The second part is accurate, though \"appropriately respond to public opinions\" could be more concise as \"respond appropriately to public opinion.\"\n- The second translation is fluent and accurate. \"To the extent permissible under statutory restrictions\" is a natural way to express the legal constraints. \"Enable the financial community and the Public to have a full understanding\" is well phrased, though \"Public\" should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun. The second part is excellent, with \"stays in touch with the pulse of society\" and \"make appropriate responses to public opinion\" being natural and accurate.\n- The third translation is mostly accurate but has a minor issue with \"is in control of the social pulse.\" The phrase \"in touch with the pulse of society\" is more idiomatic than \"in control of the social pulse.\" Also, \"make every effort to ensure\" is slightly less formal than \"make every effort to ensure\" but still acceptable.\n- The fourth translation is awkward in structure. \"In ensuring the financial community and the public have a full understanding\" is not the best way to start the sentence. The second part is good, but \"maintains in touch with the pulse of society\" should be \"maintains contact with the pulse of society\" or \"stays in touch with the pulse of society.\"\n- The fifth translation is very strong. \"To the extent possible, ensure the financial community and the public are fully informed\" is natural and accurate. \"Taking into account statutory restrictions on disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data\" is well phrased. The second part is excellent: \"Ensure the HKMA is in touch with the pulse of society and provides appropriate responses to public opinion.\"\n- The sixth translation is accurate but slightly less natural in phrasing. \"Taking into account the market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and statutory restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information\" is good, but \"make every effort to ensure that the financial community and the public have a full understanding\" is slightly wordy. The second part is good, though \"understands the pulse of society\" is less idiomatic than \"is in touch with the pulse of society.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, natural, and accurately reflect the original meaning. It should use the dictionary terms appropriately and maintain the formal tone of the original text. The fifth translation is the strongest, with natural phrasing and accurate use of the dictionary terms. It also maintains the structure and intent of the original text. Minor adjustments can be made to enhance fluency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\n- To the extent possible, ensure the financial community and the public are fully informed of the HKMA's work, taking into account statutory restrictions on disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data; and  \n- Ensure the HKMA is in touch with the pulse of society and provides appropriate responses to public opinion.\n\n# Communicating with the Public\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) outlining its objectives. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as the subject.\n- The term \"official reserves\" is consistently translated as \"official Reserves\" (with capitalization in some translations), though \"official reserves\" is more standard in lowercase.\n- The term \"financial infrastructure\" is well translated, and \"resilient\" and \"diversified\" are appropriate for \"穩健及多元化.\"\n- The phrase \"consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\" is well rendered in most translations.\n- The use of \"strives to promote\" aligns with the dictionary entry for \"致力.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"monetary and banking system\" while others use \"monetary and banking sector.\" The original text uses \"銀行體系\" (banking system), so \"monetary and banking system\" is more accurate.\n- \"Reserves\" is capitalized in some translations, which is unnecessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n- \"Promote the development of Hong Kong's economy\" is more natural than \"promote Hong Kong’s economic development,\" though both are acceptable.\n- \"Monitor\" and \"oversee\" are both acceptable for \"監察,\" but \"monitoring\" is more commonly used in this context.\n- \"Sound and diversified\" vs. \"resilient and diversified\" – both are acceptable, but \"sound\" may be more aligned with \"穩健\" in the context of financial infrastructure.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"monetary and banking system.\"\n- Use lowercase for \"reserves\" unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Use \"monitoring\" rather than \"oversee\" for \"監察.\"\n- Use \"promote the development of Hong Kong's economy\" for better fluency.\n- Choose \"sound and diversified\" for \"穩健及多元化\" to align with the nuance of \"soundness\" and \"diversification.\"\n**Best Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority strives to promote the stability of the monetary and banking system, effectively manage official reserves, develop and monitor sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and promoting the development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"rigorous approach\" and \"leverages social media platforms.\" However, it uses \"matters highly publicized\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"matters of public concern.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. It uses \"false information and rumors related to its policies,\" which is appropriate. However, \"fulfills its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public with a rigorous attitude\" is slightly wordy.\n3. **Translation 3** is mostly accurate but uses \"people\" instead of \"public,\" which is less precise in this context. It also uses \"Digital age\" with a capital \"D,\" which is unnecessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n4. **Translation 4** has several issues. It uses \"personnel\" instead of \"public,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may cause confusion. Additionally, \"leverage\" is used incorrectly as \"leverage social media platforms\" should be \"leverage social media platforms.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, with a natural flow. It uses \"make every effort to address issues that are widely concerned by the public,\" which is slightly awkward but understandable. It also uses \"promptly clarifying false information,\" which is appropriate.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"matters that are of public concern\" and \"timely clarifying misinformation and rumors regarding HKMA policies,\" which are both natural and precise. It also correctly uses \"digital era\" and \"HKMA\" consistently.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"public\" consistently instead of \"personnel\" or \"people.\"\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently with the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n- Use \"digital age\" or \"digital era\" without capitalization unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Use \"matters of public concern\" instead of \"matters highly publicized\" or \"issues that are widely concerned.\"\n- Use \"clarifying misinformation and rumors related to its policies\" for clarity and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must gain the trust of the public to effectively fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, the HKMA takes a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility of explaining its policies and work to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive links with the media and leverages social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA also makes every effort to handle matters that are of public concern and fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities, particularly by timely clarifying misinformation and rumors related to HKMA policies through traditional and social media.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's office is equipped with an information centre, which is divided into a library and an exhibition area. It is open six days a week to the public for visits and use. Work related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's communications and linkages with the public is detailed in the chapter \"Functions of the Institution\" (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"briefing\" and \"related queries.\" However, it uses \"the Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is less precise. It also uses \"are regularly published\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"are regularly published.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with the same minor issue of using \"the Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It uses \"providing briefings\" which is slightly more natural than \"briefing.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate, using \"HKMA\" consistently. It uses \"works\" instead of \"work,\" which is slightly off, and \"before the Financial Affairs Committee\" is less standard than \"to the Financial Affairs Committee.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, \"providing briefings\" is natural, and \"before the Financial Affairs Committee\" is replaced with \"to the Financial Affairs Committee,\" which is more standard.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and contains awkward phrasing, such as \"briefing on various work and policies\" and \"reports presented to the Financial Affairs Committee.\" It also uses \"the Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"questions\" instead of \"queries.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is very accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" consistently and \"briefing sessions\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"provided by the Chief Executive of the HKMA\" which is natural and precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently, as it is the official name. It should use \"briefing\" or \"briefing sessions\" as per the dictionary, and \"queries\" or \"enquiries\" for \"查詢.\" The phrase \"three times a year\" is more natural than \"three times annually.\" Also, \"are published on the HKMA website\" is more concise and natural than \"are regularly published on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Legislative Council is very important for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA’s various work and policies, and to answer related queries. Briefing sessions provided by the Chief Executive of the HKMA to the Financial Affairs Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\nIn addition, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority occasionally attend meetings of the Legislative Council Affairs Committee and sub-committees to explain and discuss special matters, as well as assist Members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information Disclosure\n\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency, publishing various bilingual journals and special publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) not only has a dedicated section listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, but also carries a large number of HKMA-published publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing session documents.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regularly reviews whether the disclosure of information relating to the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuing Office's accounts is sufficient. The HKMA participated in the International Monetary Fund's \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" programme for central banks since 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuing Committee, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operations of the Currency Issuing Office. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has carried banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\n# Internal Controls and External Audit\nThe original title, \"# 內部監控與外部審計,\" translates to \"Internal Monitoring and External Audit.\" However, the dictionary provides alternative translations for \"監控\" (monitoring), including \"controls,\" \"mechanisms,\" \"control,\" \"measures,\" and \"monitor.\" Among these, \"controls\" is the most commonly used and appropriate term in the context of internal processes and governance, especially when paired with \"audit\" in professional or corporate settings.\nThe junior translators have mostly used \"Internal Controls and External Audit,\" which is accurate and natural in English. However, some translations include a \"#\" symbol, which is not necessary in the English title unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement. Additionally, the capitalization of \"Controls\" and \"Audit\" should be consistent with standard title case conventions.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Internal Controls and External Audit,\" using the most appropriate and natural terms from the dictionary, without unnecessary symbols or inconsistent capitalization.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) implementation of a monitoring mechanism to ensure high standards of staff conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. It also highlights the role of internal and external audit functions in independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"controls\" for \"機制\" and \"effectiveness\" for \"成效.\" The translation is fluent but slightly inconsistent with the dictionary, as \"機制\" is better translated as \"mechanism\" or \"system.\" Also, \"with high standards\" is awkward phrasing.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"monitoring mechanism\" for \"機制\" and \"adequate\" for \"足夠.\" It is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"upholding\" is not in the dictionary, and \"HKMA\" is used without clarification.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"control mechanisms\" for \"機制\" and \"impact\" for \"成效.\" It is fluent but \"impact\" is not the best fit for \"成效\" in this context. Also, \"have an impact\" is less precise than \"effectiveness.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"control mechanisms\" for \"機制\" and \"effectiveness\" for \"成效.\" It is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"adherence to\" is not in the dictionary, and \"Monetary Authority\" is used without clarification.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"monitoring mechanisms\" for \"機制\" and \"adequate\" for \"足夠.\" It is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. It also clarifies \"HKMA\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is good for clarity.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"monitoring mechanisms\" for \"機制\" and \"sufficient\" for \"足夠.\" It is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"sufficient\" is less precise than \"adequate\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"monitoring mechanisms\" for \"機制\" and \"effectiveness\" for \"成效.\" It should also clarify \"HKMA\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity. The phrase \"ensure adherence to\" is not in the dictionary, so \"ensure\" alone is better. The phrase \"independent assessments on whether\" is more natural than \"independent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts robust and effective monitoring mechanisms to ensure high standards of staff conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments on whether the monitoring mechanisms are adequate and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\nThe original Traditional Chinese text is \"# 行為守則\". The term \"行為\" is present in the dictionary and must be translated as either \"behaviours\" or \"conduct\". The term \"守則\" is not in the dictionary and should be translated normally. \"守則\" translates to \"code\" or \"guidelines\", and in this context, \"Code of Conduct\" is the most natural and commonly used translation.\nAll junior translators have translated the text as \"Code of Conduct\" or \"# Code of Conduct\". The translations are mostly accurate, but there are a few observations:\n1. The use of the hash symbol (#) is not necessary unless the text is intended to be a heading in a document or list. Since the original text includes the hash symbol, it should be retained in the translation.\n2. The term \"行為\" is translated as \"conduct\" in \"Code of Conduct\", which is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary's options.\n3. The translations are all grammatically correct and fluent in English.\nImprovements could include ensuring consistency in the use of the hash symbol and verifying that the term \"行為\" is translated using one of the provided alternatives. Since \"conduct\" is the most natural and commonly used term in this context, it is the best choice.\nBased on the review, the best possible translation is:\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the behaviours of all staff at all levels meet the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Controls\n\n# Operations Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and divisions are responsible for identifying and assessing risks in their work processes, and formulating appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the proper day-to-day operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are sufficient, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe original text discusses the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Internal Audit Department in evaluating the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments to ensure they are adequate and effective, and to provide improvement recommendations.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"governance processes\" and \"adequate and effective,\" which aligns with the dictionary. However, \"processes\" is not the most precise term for \"程序\" in this context, where \"procedures\" might be more appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"procedures\" for \"程序\" and \"adequate and effective\" for \"足夠及具成效.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"Audit Division\" instead of \"Internal Audit Department,\" which may not be the official name.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"procedures\" and \"adequacy and effectiveness.\" However, it uses \"control measures\" for \"監控措施,\" which is not the best match. \"Monitoring measures\" is more appropriate. Also, \"issues recommendations\" is slightly less natural than \"provides recommendations.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"procedures\" and \"sufficient and effective.\" However, \"sufficient\" is not the best match for \"足夠及具成效,\" where \"adequate and effective\" is more natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"procedures,\" \"adequacy and effectiveness,\" and \"improvement recommendations.\" It also uses \"across different departments,\" which is a natural phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but uses \"assess\" instead of \"assesses\" (subject-verb agreement). It also uses \"control measures\" for \"監控措施,\" which is not the best match. \"Monitoring measures\" is more appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"procedures\" for \"程序,\" \"governance\" for \"管治,\" \"risk management\" for \"風險管理,\" \"monitoring measures\" for \"監控措施,\" \"adequacy and effectiveness\" for \"足夠及具成效,\" and \"improvement recommendations\" for \"改善建議.\" It should also use the correct department name and maintain subject-verb agreement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Internal Audit Department independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures across different departments, and provides improvement recommendations.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Department does not charge fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖

通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖

股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖

盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11

流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2024年第4季為178.4%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為67.0%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2024年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為143.4%及186.7%（圖14）。以上所有四個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖 13

economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, primarily driven by a rebound in goods exports amid improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle. The labor market remained resilient, with inflation staying moderate as external price pressures further eased. Hong Kong’s stock market significantly rebounded, while the property market remained generally weak due to market sentiment being pressured in a sustained high interest rate environment. Given the escalating trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China’s proactive introduction of economic stimulus measures, together with multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, should help consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international cooperation and deepen regional collaboration.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy experienced moderate growth in 2024. Real local GDP rose by 2.5% year-on-year in 2024, following a 3.2% increase recorded in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Externally, goods exports returned to positive growth, driven by improved external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle, becoming the main driver of overall economic growth. Service exports also further increased, supported by the continued recovery of the tourism industry in Hong Kong and the significant rise in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, the significant increase in service imports, driven by the sustained growth in outbound tourism, offset the positive effect that service exports had on overall economic growth. Locally, private consumption expenditure softened due to changes in the consumption patterns of local residents. In contrast, increased property transactions and an improved business climate, supported by gradually relaxed monetary conditions, led to a mild increase in overall investment expenditure.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: The quarterly changes in the seasonally adjusted total of local fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nDespite the gradual rise in newly signed private residential rental income, local cost pressures remain largely manageable, together with the gradual retreat of external price pressures, local inflation remained moderate in 2024 (Figure 2). For the whole of 2024, the basic and overall inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others. Here is a critical evaluation of their translations:\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"rental income\" for \"租金\" and \"manageable\" for \"控.\" The use of \"Figure 2\" is appropriate. However, \"basic inflation rate\" may not be the most precise term in this context, but it is acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is mostly correct but has some issues. \"Outer price pressures\" is not the best translation for \"外圍價格壓力\" — \"external\" is more appropriate. Also, \"for the whole year as a whole in 2024\" is redundant and awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"external\" for \"外圍\" and \"moderate\" for \"溫.\" However, it incorrectly translates \"基本\" as \"core\" instead of \"basic,\" which may not be the intended meaning in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"external\" for \"外圍\" and \"broadly manageable\" for \"大致受控.\" However, \"diminishing\" may not be the best synonym for \"逐步減退.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"rents\" for \"租金\" instead of \"rental income,\" which is more natural in this context. It also uses \"subsiding\" for \"逐步減退,\" which is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"rental rates\" for \"租金,\" which is acceptable. However, \"leading to moderate inflation\" may be slightly less precise than \"remained moderate.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nDespite the gradual rise in newly signed private residential rents, local cost pressures remain largely manageable, together with the gradual subsiding of external price pressures, local inflation remained moderate in 2024 (Figure 2). For the whole year of 2024, the basic and overall inflation rates were respectively 1.1% and 1.7%.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"2024\" as \"2024\" and \"施政報告\" as \"Policy Report.\"\n- The term \"穩定\" is consistently translated as \"resilient\" or \"stable,\" which aligns with the dictionary options.\n- \"人才\" is translated as \"talent\" in all translations, which is appropriate.\n- \"圖3\" is translated as \"Figure 3\" or \"Chart 3,\" which is acceptable.\n- \"優化\" is translated as \"enhancements\" or \"optimization,\" which are valid options.\n- \"人手\" is translated as \"manpower,\" which is accurate.\n- \"勞工\" is translated as \"labour\" or \"labor,\" both of which are acceptable.\n- \"經濟\" is translated as \"economy\" or \"economic,\" which is appropriate.\n- \"增長\" is translated as \"growth\" or \"increase,\" which are valid.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"labour\" while others use \"labor,\" which is inconsistent. \"Labour\" is more commonly used in British English, while \"labor\" is more common in American English. The original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is more aligned with British English conventions, so \"labour\" is preferable.\n- \"圖3\" is translated as \"Chart 3\" in one translation and \"Figure 3\" in others. \"Figure\" is more standard in academic or formal contexts.\n- \"施政報告\" is translated as \"Policy Report\" in most translations, which is correct, but one translation uses \"Policy Address,\" which is less accurate.\n- \"人才吸引計劃\" is translated as \"talent attraction plan\" or \"talent attraction Scheme.\" \"Scheme\" is more formal and appropriate for government programs.\n- \"人數\" is translated as \"number of people\" or \"employment numbers,\" which are both acceptable, but \"total employment numbers\" is more concise.\n- \"輕人\" is translated as \"young people,\" which is correct.\n- \"緩\" is translated as \"alleviate,\" which is accurate.\n- \"新動力\" is translated as \"new momentum\" or \"new impetus,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"new momentum\" is more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"labour\" consistently with British English conventions.\n- Use \"Figure 3\" for \"圖3.\"\n- Use \"Policy Report\" for \"施政報告.\"\n- Use \"Scheme\" for \"計劃\" in the context of government programs.\n- Use \"manpower\" for \"人手.\"\n- Use \"resilient\" or \"robust\" for \"穩健.\"\n- Use \"new momentum\" for \"新動力.\"\n- Ensure fluency and natural phrasing in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe labour market showed resilient performance in 2024, with the unemployment rate remaining low throughout the year, ranging between 2.9% and 3.1% (Figure 3). Since the first quarter, total employment numbers (Figure 3) have gradually increased, and the labour force has also expanded, reflecting a generally stable balance between labour demand and supply. Meanwhile, with continued economic growth, both nominal wages and labour income have recorded robust growth. In addition, the government announced in the 2024 Policy Report further enhancements to Hong Kong’s talent attraction Scheme to alleviate manpower shortages in various industries, and to inject new momentum into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Situation  \nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a report or publication, that identifies the figure as \"Figure 3\" and describes its content as \"Labour Market Situation,\" with the source of the data being the \"Census and Statistics Department.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 3\" and \"Labour Market Conditions.\" Properly identifies the source.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Conditions\" is less precise than \"Situation\" in this context. Also, the source is listed as \"Census and Statistics Department\" but the dictionary includes \"Source\" and \"Sources\" as possible translations for \"資料,\" which could be used for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first, with correct formatting and terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Situation\" instead of \"Conditions,\" which is more natural in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Source of information\" instead of \"Data Source,\" which is less concise and slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Situation\" and \"Data Source,\" which are both accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The period after \"Situation\" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Situation\" and \"Source,\" which are both accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Source\" is less specific than \"Data Source\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Situation\" and \"Data Source,\" which are both accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The line break after \"Situation\" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Figure 3\" as per the dictionary, \"Labour Market Situation\" as it is more natural than \"Conditions\" in this context, and \"Data Source\" to clearly indicate the origin of the data. The use of \"Data Source: Census and Statistics Department\" is concise, accurate, and aligns with standard formatting for captions in reports or publications. The line break after \"Situation\" is unnecessary and should be omitted for a more fluent and professional appearance.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 3 Labour Market Situation  \nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of nuance, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the timeline, key events (e.g., the Fed rate cuts, the US election), and the performance of the Hang Seng Index.\n- The use of terms like \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"Federal Reserve,\" and \"proactive economic stimulus measures\" is consistent and accurate.\n- The translations are fluent and natural in English, with minimal grammatical errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"shifted\" or \"turned around\" interchangeably, but \"turned around\" is more idiomatic in this context.\n- The phrase \"ending a streak of annual declines for four years\" in Translation 6 is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.\n- The term \"market correction\" in Translation 5 is not standard in this context; \"pullback\" or \"slight decline\" is more appropriate.\n- Some translations use \"year-high\" instead of \"year-to-date high\" or \"annual high,\" which may not fully capture the nuance of the original.\n- The dictionary specifies that \"四年\" should be translated as \"four years,\" and all translations correctly use this term.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"turned around\" to reflect the reversal of a negative trend.\n- \"Year-to-date high\" is more precise than \"year-high\" in financial contexts.\n- \"Pullback\" is more commonly used in financial writing than \"retreat\" or \"correction.\"\n- The phrase \"ending a streak of annual declines over four years\" is more natural than \"ending a streak of annual declines for four years.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong stock market turned around significantly in 2024, following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and the Mainland launching proactive economic stimulus measures, market sentiment improved significantly, driving the Hang Seng Index to a year-to-date high of 23,100 points on October 7, closing at that level (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November triggered concerns about global economic prospects and the pace of the Federal Reserve’s relaxation of monetary policy, leading to a slight pullback in the Hong Kong stock market. Despite this, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points at the end of the year, a substantial increase of 17.7% compared to the end of 2023, ending a streak of annual declines over four years.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. The phrase \"showed signs of stabilization\" is slightly less natural than \"showed signs of recovery\" or \"showed signs of returning to stability.\" The use of \"transactions\" for \"宗\" is correct, and the term \"mortgage rates\" is appropriately used for \"按揭利率.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some awkward phrasing, such as \"whole year residential transactions surged by 23.5% from the record-low of 43,000 transactions.\" The use of \"record-low\" is not in the dictionary, and \"whole year\" is not the best choice for \"全年.\" The term \"consumption model\" is not ideal for \"模式.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in meaning and uses appropriate terms from the dictionary. The phrase \"the whole year’s residential transactions surged\" is slightly awkward, and \"housing affordability was also slightly improved\" is not as natural as \"housing affordability also improved slightly.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"year-on-year\" correctly for \"按年\" and \"abundant supply\" for \"充裕.\" The phrase \"leading to a slight improvement in home purchase affordability\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"recovery\" for \"回穩跡象,\" which is a good choice. The phrase \"the continued high level of mortgage rates\" is slightly wordy, and \"office spaces\" is not as precise as \"office buildings.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"units\" for \"宗,\" which is acceptable but not the best choice. The phrase \"with housing affordability slightly improving\" is slightly awkward, and \"adequate supply\" is not as precise as \"robust supply.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"residential property market\" for \"住宅物業市場.\"\n- Use \"showed signs of recovery\" for \"出現回穩跡象.\"\n- Use \"relaxation of related policy measures\" for \"相關政策措施放寬.\"\n- Use \"interest rate cut cycle\" for \"減息周期.\"\n- Use \"transactions\" for \"宗.\"\n- Use \"mortgage rates\" for \"按揭利率.\"\n- Use \"year-on-year\" for \"按年.\"\n- Use \"residential properties\" for \"住宅.\"\n- Use \"non-residential property market\" for \"非住宅物業市場.\"\n- Use \"office buildings\" for \"寫字樓.\"\n- Use \"retail shops\" for \"零售商舖.\"\n- Use \"consumption patterns\" for \"消費模式.\"\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe residential property market remained generally weak during the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of recovery in the fourth quarter. Supported by the relaxation of related policy measures in late February and mid-October, as well as the interest rate cut cycle starting in September, the annual residential transaction volume rose substantially by 23.5% from the historical low of 43,002 transactions in 2023 to 53,099 transactions in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage rates and the accumulated inventory in the primary market continued to exert downward pressure on property prices. As a result, property prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, with housing affordability slightly improving, although it remained relatively tight. The non-residential property market remained weak. Among them, the vacancy rate of office buildings remained high amid robust supply, while retail shops faced challenges brought about by changes in the consumption patterns of both visitors and local residents.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in formatting and capitalization. The term \"經濟\" is correctly translated as \"economic\" in all cases, and \"環境\" is appropriately rendered as \"environment.\" However, the use of capitalization and the presence of the \"#\" symbol in some translations introduce unnecessary variation.\nThe most fluent and natural translation would be \"Economic Environment,\" which follows standard English title capitalization conventions and omits the \"#\" symbol, which is not typically used in English headings unless in specific formatting contexts. This version maintains clarity and adheres to common stylistic norms.\n\nGiven the escalating trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and capital flows, Hong Kong's economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, relevant authorities and the banking sector continue to provide multifaceted support, which should enhance the resilience of local enterprises. The Mainland proactively launches economic stimulus measures and makes significant breakthroughs in frontier technology sectors, which should also boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and accelerate integration with emerging markets. Meanwhile, with the Mainland authorities' pro-Hong Kong tourism policies and the government's support in striving to boost Hong Kong's tourism industry, inbound tourism is expected to see further growth.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. As rising rental income gradually passes through to consumer prices, local costs may face mild upward pressure. However, despite increased uncertainty in global economic prospects, external price pressures should remain moderate. On the other hand, the labor market may face challenges due to heightened trade tensions. However, various talent attraction programs should help continue building a high-quality talent pool, providing support for the long-term development of the economy.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2024, with banks' capital and liquidity both robust. Amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risks faced by the banking sector increased during the year, but the overall quality of banks' assets remained manageable. Benefiting from rising investment gains from held-for-trading investments, as well as increased fee and commission income, retail banking profits grew compared to 2023.\n\n# Asset Quality\nThe original text is \"# 資產質素\" with the dictionary specifying that \"資產\" should be translated as \"asset(s)\", \"asset\", or \"assets\". The term \"質素\" is not in the dictionary and should be translated normally.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. \"Asset Quality\" – This is correct in terms of translation and capitalization, but the use of a hashtag (#) is missing.\n2. \"asset quality\" – This is grammatically correct but uses lowercase, which may not be appropriate for a title.\n3. \"Asset Quality\" – Same as the first translation, correct but missing the hashtag.\n4. \"Asset quality\" – Grammatically correct but inconsistent in capitalization.\n5. \"# Asset Quality\" – Correct in including the hashtag and proper capitalization.\n6. \"# Asset quality\" – Correct in including the hashtag but inconsistent in capitalization.\nReasoning for the best possible translation: The original text includes a hashtag, which should be preserved. \"資產\" is best translated as \"Asset\" with a capital letter when used as a title or heading. \"質素\" translates naturally to \"Quality\" in this context. Therefore, the best translation would be \"# Asset Quality\".\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系\", \"loan\" for \"貸款\", and \"delinquency\" for \"拖欠\".\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of terms like \"sector-specific\" for \"特定分類\" and \"coverage ratio\" for \"覆蓋率\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"sector-specific classified loan ratio\" redundantly, which can be simplified to \"sector-specific loan ratio\" or \"classified loan ratio\" depending on context.\n- The phrase \"credit provisions and sector-specific loan ratio\" in the definition of \"coverage ratio\" is slightly ambiguous and could be clarified as \"credit provisions relative to the sector-specific loan ratio\".\n- The term \"adjusted coverage ratio\" is used, but the explanation of how it is adjusted (i.e., by deducting collateral value from non-performing loans) is not always clearly conveyed.\n- Some translations use \"Mainland China\" inconsistently, sometimes as \"Mainland\" and sometimes as \"Mainland China\", which should be standardized.\n- The term \"bank provisions\" is used in some translations, but \"loan loss reserves\" or \"credit provisions\" may be more precise in a financial context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"sector-specific loan ratio\" consistently where \"特定分類貸款比率\" is used.\n- Clarify the definition of \"coverage ratio\" to avoid ambiguity.\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Mainland China\" or \"Mainland\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"loan loss reserves\" or \"credit provisions\" depending on the context, and ensure clarity in how the adjusted coverage ratio is calculated.\n- Ensure that the term \"delinquency\" is used consistently and appropriately.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe sector-specific loan ratio of the banking sector rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the ratio of delinquent and restructured loans increased from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). This increase in the sector-specific loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in loan ratings for some Mainland China real estate developers, as well as local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the sector-specific loan ratio for related loans in Mainland China decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024. Banks maintained sufficient loan loss reserves. As at the end of 2024, the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., credit provisions relative to the sector-specific loan ratio) was approximately 65%. If the realizable value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the adjusted credit provision coverage ratio was approximately 145%. At the same time, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained at low levels at the end of 2024, at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a simple caption for a figure, likely from a report or publication. The key elements are the figure number (\"圖 5\"), the title (\"銀行體系的資產質素\"), and the source (\"資料來源：金管局\").\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\" and \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The translation is accurate and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Similar to the first, with correct terminology and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The colon after \"Figure 5\" is missing, which slightly affects readability.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Figure 5: Asset quality of the banking sector\" and \"Data source: HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is an abbreviation for Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which may not be familiar to all readers. Also, \"Data source\" is less standard than \"Source.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Figure 5 Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\" and \"Data Source: Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Monetary Authority\" is vague and not the official name of the organization. Also, \"Data Source\" is not the standard term for \"資料來源.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The period after the figure title is unnecessary and slightly disrupts the flow.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** None.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Mapping 5 banking sector asset quality\" which is incorrect. \"Mapping\" is not the correct translation for \"圖\" in this context. Also, \"金管局\" is not translated and left in Chinese.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Figure\" for \"圖\" (as \"Figure\" is the standard term for a numbered illustration in reports).\n- Use \"Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\" for \"銀行體系的資產質素\" (accurate and natural).\n- Use \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"資料來源：金管局\" (accurate and official).\n- Maintain proper punctuation and formatting for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a title for a chart or figure that presents the delinquency ratio for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly used appropriate terms, though with some variations in style and structure.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 6 Residential mortgage loans and credit card loans delinquency ratio.\"  \n     - **Strengths:** Uses \"Figure 6\" and correctly translates \"delinquency ratio.\"  \n     - **Weaknesses:** Lacks punctuation and capitalization, making it less formal and harder to read. Also, \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" is not the correct translation for \"金管局\" (HKMA).\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 6 Residential Mortgage Loan and Credit Card Loan Delinquency Ratio  \n     Data Source: Monetary Authority of Hong Kong\"  \n     - **Strengths:** Proper capitalization and structure. Correctly identifies \"Monetary Authority of Hong Kong\" as the source.  \n     - **Weaknesses:** \"Loan\" is unnecessarily capitalized, and \"Data Source\" is not the most concise phrasing.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 6 Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \n     Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n     - **Strengths:** Clear, well-structured, and accurate. Uses \"Source\" correctly.  \n     - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Same as the third, so no additional comments.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 6: Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans  \n     Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n     - **Strengths:** Uses a colon after \"Figure 6\" and correctly capitalizes \"Delinquency ratios.\"  \n     - **Weaknesses:** \"Ratios\" is plural, which may not match the singular \"比率\" in the original, though it is acceptable in context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 6: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n     - **Strengths:** Well-structured, with proper punctuation and capitalization.  \n     - **Weaknesses:** The use of a period after the figure title may be slightly more formal than needed, but it is still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use appropriate terminology. It should also match the original structure and tone. Based on the above analysis, the fifth and sixth translations are the most accurate and well-structured. However, the sixth translation slightly over-formalizes the punctuation, while the fifth uses \"ratios\" instead of \"ratio,\" which may not be the best fit for the singular \"比率.\"\nThe optimal translation would use \"Delinquency Ratio\" (singular) to match the original, and use a colon after \"Figure 6\" for clarity and formality. It should also use \"Source\" rather than \"Data Source\" for brevity and consistency with the original.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nRetail banking’s overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the average return on assets after tax for the same period rose from 0.88% to 0.93% (Figure 7). The profit growth was mainly due to gains from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and increased fee and commission income (+15.4%), but part of the increase was offset by a decrease in net interest income (–5.2%). The net interest margin of retail banking narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). At the same time, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banking rose slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, with a clear structure: a title (\"圖 7 零售銀行的表現\") followed by a source citation (\"資料來源：金管局\"). The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the task is to select the most appropriate ones in context.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 7 Retail Banking Performance\" is grammatically correct and fluent.  \n   - However, \"Monetary Authority of Gold\" is a misinterpretation of \"金管局\" (HKMA). \"金\" here refers to \"monetary\" or \"financial,\" not \"gold.\"  \n   - **Weakness:** Incorrect translation of \"金管局\" as \"Monetary Authority of Gold.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 7: Performance of Retail Banks. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - This is accurate and fluent.  \n   - \"Retail Banks\" is a good translation of \"零售銀行.\"  \n   - **Strength:** Correct use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Weakness:** Slight inconsistency in punctuation (period after \"Banks\" instead of colon).\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 7 Performance of Retail Banking Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n   - The structure is slightly awkward due to the lack of punctuation between the title and the source.  \n   - **Weakness:** Poor punctuation and spacing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Chart 7: Performance of Retail Banks Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n   - \"Chart\" is a valid translation for \"圖,\" but \"Figure\" is more commonly used in academic or formal contexts.  \n   - **Weakness:** \"Chart\" may be less appropriate than \"Figure\" for a title like this.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Cyber Mapping 7 retail banks’ performance Source: 金管局\"  \n   - \"Cyber Mapping\" is an incorrect and overly technical translation of \"圖.\"  \n   - \"金管局\" is not translated at all, which is a major flaw.  \n   - **Weakness:** Both incorrect term translation and failure to translate the source.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 7 Retail banks’ performance Source: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n   - This is accurate and fluent.  \n   - \"Retail banks’ performance\" is a natural phrasing.  \n   - **Strength:** Correct use of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Weakness:** Slight inconsistency in punctuation (space between \"performance\" and \"Source\").\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Figure\" for \"圖\" as it is the most standard and formal term in academic or professional contexts.\n- Use \"Performance of Retail Banking\" to maintain the structure and meaning of the original title.\n- Translate \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (the official name).\n- Ensure proper punctuation and spacing for clarity and readability.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 8: Retail Bank Net Interest Margin  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a financial report or academic paper, and it includes a title and a source. The key elements are \"圖 8\" (Figure 8), \"零售銀行淨息差\" (Retail Bank Net Interest Margin), and \"資料來源：金管局\" (Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 8\" and \"Retail Bank Net Interest Margin.\" Properly translates \"資料來源：金管局\" as \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, accurate translation.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 8\" and \"Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Monetary Authority of Hong Kong\" is not the official name of the institution. The correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Cyber Mapping\" for \"圖,\" which is an unusual but technically valid option from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"retail bank’s net interest margin\" is awkwardly phrased. Also, \"Source: 金管局\" is not translated, which is a major error.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 8\" and \"Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking.\" Properly translates \"資料來源：金管局\" as \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, accurate translation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Figure 8\" and \"Retail Bank Net Interest Margin.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Retail bank net interest margin\" lacks the article \"the\" and is slightly less formal than the other translations.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Figure 8\" and \"Retail Bank Net Interest Margin.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Gold Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the official name of the institution. \"Figure 8\" is the most appropriate translation for \"圖 8.\" \"Retail Bank Net Interest Margin\" is a clear and standard financial term. \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is the correct and official translation of \"資料來源：金管局.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 8: Retail Bank Net Interest Margin  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 9 Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector's balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, primarily due to an increase in negotiable debt instruments (+13.4%). Loan demand was subdued due to high borrowing costs, resulting in a 2.8% decrease in total loans in 2024. Loans used in Hong Kong decreased by 2.1%, while loans used outside Hong Kong decreased by 5.7%, whereas trade financing increased by 4.6%. Loans related to Mainland China decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nIn the provided translations, several junior translators have produced versions that are largely accurate and fluent. However, there are notable differences in phrasing and some minor inaccuracies that could be refined for clarity and precision.\nThe first, second, third, and fourth translations are very similar and all convey the intended meaning clearly. They correctly use \"loan-to-deposit ratio\" and \"at the end of 2023\" and \"at the end of 2024.\" The use of \"liabilities on the balance sheet\" or \"liability side of the balance sheet\" is appropriate. However, the fifth translation has a significant issue: it incorrectly translates \"資產負債表的負債方面\" as \"asset and liability balance sheet liabilities,\" which is redundant and grammatically awkward. It also uses \"Chart 10\" instead of \"Figure 10,\" which may be inconsistent with the original text's reference to \"圖10.\"\nThe sixth translation is also accurate but uses \"the total amount of deposits\" and \"the total amount of loans,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary. While not incorrect, it is less concise than the alternatives.\nThe best approach would be to combine the clarity and conciseness of the first, second, third, and fourth translations while avoiding the redundancy and grammatical issues in the fifth. The use of \"loan-to-deposit ratio\" is standard in financial contexts, and \"Figure 10\" is the correct translation of \"圖10.\"\nBased on this review, the improved translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard financial terminology.\nIn terms of dictionary usage, all terms are correctly translated. For example, \"存款\" is translated as \"deposits,\" \"貸款\" as \"loans,\" \"比率\" as \"ratio,\" and \"年底\" as \"at the end of.\" The term \"資產負債表\" is translated as \"balance sheet,\" which is accurate and consistent with financial terminology.\nOverall, the translations are strong, but the best version would be a concise, grammatically correct version that avoids redundancy and uses standard financial terminology.\nHere is the improved translation:\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to an increase of 5.1% in 2023. Due to the decrease in total loans and the increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking sector maintained robust capital in 2024. At the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% in the previous year; the primary capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11).

{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2024年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港銀行業對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔，以及主要先進經濟體的最新貨幣政策實施框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n圖 5

香港鈔票\n\n年內金管局舉辦14場有關香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的講座，吸引超過2,600人參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖收銀員及學生，有助提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 美元流動資金安排\n\n金管局推出美元流動資金安排的優化措施，包括將交收周期由T+1縮短至T+0，於5月24日生效。此項恆常流動資金安排可在持牌銀行有需要時為其提供備用流動性，尤其是在5月28日美國開始實施交收周期縮短至T+1的情況下。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。截至2024年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為13,068億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n在2024年，金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）發表15份對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題的研究論文，並透過五期開放取用電子期刊與全球讀者分享研究成果。研究中心亦出版兩份《Insights from MonetaryResearch》，就其近期發表的研究論文為公眾提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究工作外，研究中心舉辦一系列知識交流活動，促進與不同參與者的聯繫。年內舉辦31場以本地參與者為對象的研討會或網上研討會，探討重要貨幣及金融研究議題。在國際層面，金融學院與研究中心聯同學術機構、各國央行及國際金融機構舉辦四次國際會議及五次研討會或圓桌會議，促進就廣泛經濟及金融事務的對話與交流。\n\n這些國際活動包括：\n\n4月11日\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\n\n6月6至7日

surrounding the direction of U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets have continued to remain smooth and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, then strengthened for the rest of the year. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banks' interbank lending rates generally followed the trend of U.S. interest rates, while also being influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text regarding Hong Kong's monetary policy and the currency board system. However, they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms provided.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy as maintaining monetary stability.\n- Most translations accurately reflect the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar.\n- The use of \"Exchange Fund\" and \"monetary base\" is consistent with the dictionary terms.\n- The concept of the currency board system or \"currency issue department system\" is generally well conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"currency issue department system\" or \"Exchange Fund Note Issuance System,\" which are not standard terms for the \"貨幣發行局制度\" (currency board system). The correct term from the dictionary is \"system\" or \"regime.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are awkwardly phrased, such as \"the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market remains within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars for 1 US dollar.\" This is grammatically incorrect and unclear.\n- **Use of \"Reserves\":** Some translations capitalize \"Reserves\" unnecessarily, which is not standard unless referring to a specific entity.\n- **\"Monetary Foundation\" vs. \"Monetary Base\":** The term \"monetary base\" is more accurate than \"monetary foundation\" in this context, as per the dictionary.\n- **\"Shall\" vs. \"Must\":** The dictionary specifies \"shall\" for \"須,\" but some translations use \"must,\" which is acceptable but not the exact match.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"currency board system\" or \"currency issuance system\" as the correct translation for \"貨幣發行局制度.\"\n- Ensure consistent use of \"monetary base\" and not \"monetary foundation.\"\n- Use \"shall\" for \"須\" as per the dictionary.\n- Avoid unnecessary capitalization of terms like \"Reserves\" unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Improve sentence structure for clarity and fluency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the currency board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund shall provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if there are changes in the monetary base, the US dollar reserves shall also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary base (Table 1) includes:\nThe original phrase \"貨幣基礎（表1）包括\" translates to \"Monetary base (Table 1) includes.\" The junior translators have mostly captured the correct meaning, but there are some inconsistencies in capitalization and term selection.\nThe term \"貨幣\" is best translated as \"monetary\" in this context, as it refers to a concept rather than physical currency. \"基礎\" is best translated as \"base\" in financial terminology, which is more precise than \"foundation\" or \"infrastructure.\" \"表\" is correctly translated as \"Table,\" and \"1\" is correctly translated as \"1.\" The verb \"包括\" is best translated as \"includes,\" which is grammatically correct and commonly used in such contexts.\nThe first, second, fourth, and fifth translations are the most accurate, with only minor differences in capitalization. The third translation uses \"Currency foundation,\" which is less precise than \"Monetary base.\" The sixth translation uses \"Currency (Table 1) including,\" which is grammatically incorrect and lacks the verb \"includes.\"\nBased on this review, the best translation would be \"Monetary base (Table 1) includes,\" which is grammatically correct, uses the most appropriate terms, and maintains the intended meaning of the original text.\n\n- Certificate(s) of Indebtedness (providing full support for banknotes issued by three issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins;  \n- Aggregate balance of the settlement account held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., the total balance); and  \n- Bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government under the Foreign Exchange Fund.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Basis\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"穩定\" as \"stability,\" \"機制\" as \"mechanism,\" and \"港元\" as \"Hong Kong dollar\" or \"HK$.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" is consistent across translations, which is a key term from the dictionary.\n- The translations all capture the mechanism of the exchange guarantee and its effect on the exchange rate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"exchange Convertibility\" instead of \"exchange guarantee,\" which is a direct mismatch with the dictionary entry for \"兌換.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"exchange scope\" instead of \"exchange rate range,\" which is not an appropriate translation for \"範圍\" in this context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"exchange assurance\" instead of \"exchange guarantee,\" which is not listed in the dictionary for \"兌換保證.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"HKD\" and \"USD\" consistently, which is more concise and appropriate for financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"automated\" instead of \"automatic,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation.\n- **Translation 5** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" consistently, \"exchange guarantee\" correctly, and \"exchange rate range\" appropriately.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently, as it is the standard abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- \"Exchange guarantee\" should be used instead of \"exchange Convertibility\" or \"exchange assurance,\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"Exchange rate range\" is the correct translation for \"兌換範圍\" in this context.\n- \"Aggregate Balance\" should be capitalized consistently if it is a specific term.\n- The phrase \"stands ready to\" is more natural and commonly used in financial contexts than \"will be standing ready to\" or \"will, upon banks' requests.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars) at a rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar (or 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar) at the request of banks, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and thus prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\nThe original text is a short title: \"# 匯率穩定\". The junior translators have all correctly identified \"匯率\" as \"exchange rate\" and \"穩定\" as \"stability,\" which is the most appropriate term in this context. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in formatting and capitalization among the translations.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations simply use \"Exchange rate stability,\" which is correct and natural in English. The second, fifth, and sixth translations include a \"#\" symbol, which may be intended to denote a heading or section title, but it is not part of the original Chinese text. The sixth translation also capitalizes \"Rate\" in \"Exchange Rate Stability,\" which is not standard unless it is a proper noun or title.\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and stylistically appropriate. Since the original text does not include a \"#\" symbol, it should be omitted. Additionally, \"Exchange rate stability\" is the most natural and standard phrasing in this context, without unnecessary capitalization.\nTherefore, the best translation is:\nExchange rate stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar slightly weakened as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened, primarily supported by dividend-related funding demand and active trading in the stock market. In early August, concerns about a potential U.S. economic slowdown and expectations of faster and more substantial interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve triggered the unwinding of carry trade positions and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar, pushing the Hong Kong dollar to the strong side of the exchange guarantee range. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from a surge in trading activity in Hong Kong's stock market following the mainland's announcement of a series of economic stimulus measures. The Hong Kong dollar subsequently weakened slightly in early November, partly due to a moderation in the rise of Hong Kong's stock market and partly due to the strong performance of the U.S. economy, which gave the Federal Open Market Committee room to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded amid year-end seasonal funding demand. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate\nThe original text is a simple title: \"圖 1 2024年市場匯率,\" which translates to \"Figure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate.\" The dictionary provides several options for \"圖,\" including \"Figure,\" \"Chart,\" and \"Mapping,\" but \"Figure\" is the most standard and appropriate term for labeling a visual in a document or report. \"Market\" is correctly used for \"市場,\" and \"exchange rate\" is the accurate translation for \"匯率.\" The year \"2024\" is straightforward and should remain unchanged.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators mostly reflect this, but there are a few issues:\n- The second translation, \"Figure 1 2024 year market exchange rate,\" incorrectly inserts \"year\" after the year, which is redundant and ungrammatical.\n- The third translation, \"Figure 1 2024 exchange rate market,\" misplaces \"market,\" making the phrase awkward and unclear.\n- The sixth translation, \"Figure 1 2024 markets exchange rate,\" uses the plural \"markets,\" which is not appropriate in this context, as the original refers to the general market, not multiple markets.\nThe best translations are the first, fourth, and fifth, which all correctly use \"Figure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate.\" These are concise, grammatically correct, and use the appropriate terminology. The most natural and standard translation would be \"Figure 1 2024 Market Exchange Rate,\" which is clear, concise, and adheres to standard English conventions for labeling figures.\n\nDue to the high volume of translations, I will focus on the most critical aspects of the translations provided. First, all translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"Aggregate Balance,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"bonds,\" \"bills,\" \"outstanding,\" \"foreign exchange reserves,\" and \"Figure 2.\" However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and precision.\nThe first junior translator uses \"Aggregate Balance\" consistently and provides a clear, fluent translation. However, they use \"HK$1,290.4 billion\" and \"HK$1,428.7 billion,\" which may be inconsistent with the original text's \"12,904億港元\" and \"14,287億港元\" (which should be \"12,904 billion HKD\" and \"14,287 billion HKD\").\nThe second junior translator uses \"monetary base\" instead of \"monetary foundation,\" which is more standard in financial contexts. They also use \"foreign exchange reserves\" correctly and maintain a natural flow.\nThe third junior translator uses \"44.7 billion HKD\" instead of \"447 billion HKD,\" which is a critical error. They also use \"maintaining around 44.7 billion HKD\" instead of \"maintaining around HK$447 billion,\" which is grammatically awkward.\nThe fourth junior translator has several errors, including \"does not exchange Convertibility guarantee triggered within the year,\" which is grammatically incorrect and uses \"Convertibility\" where \"exchange guarantee\" is more appropriate. They also use \"2\" instead of \"Figure 2\" and \"Exchange Fund Reserves\" instead of \"foreign exchange reserves.\"\nThe fifth and sixth junior translators are very similar and both use \"foreign exchange reserves\" correctly. They also use \"monetary base\" and \"aggregate balance\" appropriately. However, the fifth translator uses \"around 447 billion Hong Kong dollars\" without the HK$ symbol, which is less standard in financial reporting.\nBased on this review, the best translation should use \"Aggregate Balance,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"bonds,\" \"bills,\" \"outstanding,\" \"foreign exchange reserves,\" and \"Figure 2\" as per the dictionary. It should also maintain a natural flow, use the HK$ symbol consistently, and avoid grammatical errors.\nHere is the improved translation:\nAs there was no triggering of the exchange guarantee during the year, the Aggregate Balance remained relatively stable at around HK$447 billion. At the same time, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds increased slightly from HK$12,455 billion to HK$13,839 billion. Therefore, the Aggregate Balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds increased from HK$12,904 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$14,287 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 2024 Aggregate Balance (Before Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked System), Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally follow the trend of US interest rates, with short-term rates also influenced by local supply and demand conditions. As market expectations of a cut in US policy rates gradually intensified, Hong Kong interbank offered rates softened in the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3). Driven by seasonal liquidity demand at the end of the quarter and active equity market trading, Hong Kong interbank offered rates tightened in late September, with overnight rates rising to above 6 percent at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally remained stable, rising slightly due to relatively reduced liquidity by year-end. For the year as a whole, overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points respectively, reaching 5.65 percent, 4.58 percent, and 4.37 percent by year-end.\n\nFollowing the lowering of the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range, the basic interest rate was cut three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), falling from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, as the U.S. lowered its policy rates, multiple banks reduced their preferential loan rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further lowered them by 25 basis points in early November and 12.5 basis points in late December. Under these circumstances, the average interest rate for new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, Hong Kong's currency market continued to operate normally. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$38.8 billion in 2023 to HK$50 billion in 2024; the usage of the Discount Window showed no abnormality.\n\nFigure 3 2024 Hong Kong Interbank Lending Rate\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\nThe original phrase \"聯繫匯率制度\" translates to \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The term \"聯繫\" is best translated as \"Linked\" in this context, and \"匯率\" is clearly \"exchange rate.\" \"制度\" is best rendered as \"system\" in this context, as it refers to a structured mechanism. \nAmong the junior translators' attempts, the third and fourth translations are the most accurate and fluent: \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\" These translations correctly use the dictionary terms and maintain proper capitalization and grammar. The fifth translation includes the hashtag \"#,\" which is unnecessary in this context. The sixth translation has a lowercase \"system,\" which is less standard in formal contexts. The first and second translations are less precise, with \"Based on Links\" and \"linkages exchange rate system\" being awkward or incomplete.\nThe best translation is \"Linked Exchange Rate System,\" which is both accurate and natural in English.\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a key pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in responding to challenges. Despite uncertainties regarding the direction of US policy rates and geopolitical fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency markets have maintained orderly operations, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Government also remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated in its 2024 External Sector Report that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, an agile economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA resilient banking system plays a critical role in the smooth operation of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong’s banking sector continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital conditions being robust by international standards. To ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress testing, and maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the trigger limit of 112.5% (Figure 4), primarily due to interest from investments and revaluation of investments at market prices. In accordance with arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, assets were allocated from the support portfolio to the investment portfolio, bringing the support ratio down to around 110.08% on September 11. Subsequently, the support ratio remained broadly stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s ample financial resources, together with Hong Kong’s resilient banking sector, provide a strong backing for safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4 2024 Daily Changes in Support Ratio\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text, \"圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動,\" is a title for a visual representation (likely a chart or graph) showing the daily changes in the support ratio for the year 2024. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for each term, and the goal is to select the most appropriate ones to ensure clarity, fluency, and adherence to standard English conventions.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Figure 4 Daily Changes in Support Ratio in 2024\" – This is fluent, grammatically correct, and uses \"Figure\" from the dictionary. It places the year at the end, which is natural in English titles. However, \"in 2024\" could be more concise as \"2024\" directly after the year.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Figure 4 2024 year support ratio daily changes\" – This is awkward in structure and lacks proper punctuation. The phrase \"2024 year\" is not idiomatic in English, and the lack of capitalization and prepositions makes it less readable.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Chart 4 2024 year support ratio daily change\" – Similar issues to Translation 2. \"2024 year\" is awkward, and the phrase is not properly structured. Also, \"Chart\" is acceptable, but \"daily change\" is singular, which may not match the plural \"changes\" in the original.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Cyber Mapping 4 2024 support ratio daily change\" – \"Cyber Mapping\" is an unusual and possibly incorrect translation for \"圖\" (which is more commonly \"Chart\" or \"Figure\"). The rest of the translation is awkwardly structured and lacks proper prepositions.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Chart 4 2024 Daily Change in Support Ratio\" – This is well-structured, uses \"Chart\" from the dictionary, and places the year correctly. However, \"Daily Change\" is singular, which may not fully reflect the original's \"每日變動\" (daily changes, plural).\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Chart 4 2024 Support Ratio Daily Change\" – This is concise and grammatically correct, but again, \"Daily Change\" is singular, which may not fully capture the nuance of \"每日變動\" (daily changes, plural).\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best approach is to use \"Chart\" or \"Figure\" as the visual representation, place the year \"2024\" immediately after the number, and use \"Daily Changes\" to reflect the plural nature of \"每日變動.\" The phrase \"Support Ratio\" is appropriate and matches the dictionary. The structure should be concise and follow standard English title conventions.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 4 2024 Daily Changes in Support Ratio\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system. In 2024, topics discussed by the Currency Issuance Committee included the risk exposure of Hong Kong's banking sector to non-banking financial institutions, as well as the latest frameworks for implementing monetary policies in major advanced economies. Meeting records of the Currency Issuance Committee and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's reports on the operations of the Currency Issuance System submitted to the Committee are all published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 紙幣及硬幣\". The translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to the correct translation. The main differences are in the use of capitalization, punctuation, and spacing.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use \"Banknotes and coins\" with lowercase \"coins\" and no punctuation, which is acceptable for a heading but may not be as formal as the original.\nThe second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"# Banknotes and Coins\" with a hash symbol and capitalization. This format is more consistent with the original, which also uses a hash symbol at the beginning.\nThe best translation would be \"# Banknotes and Coins\" as it maintains the original format and capitalization, which is appropriate for a heading. It also uses the correct terms from the dictionary: \"Banknotes\" for \"紙幣\" and \"Coins\" for \"硬幣\".\n\nFigure 5: Breakdown of Banknote Circulation Amounts by Issuing Bank at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Circulating Banknotes at the End of 2024\nFigure 6: Distribution of Circulating Banknotes at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2024\nThis translation effectively captures the meaning of the original Chinese text. It uses \"Figure\" from the dictionary for \"圖,\" \"Banknotes\" for \"紙幣,\" \"in Circulation\" for \"流通,\" and \"at the End of 2024\" for \"2024年底.\" The structure is clear and natural in English, making it easy to understand. The use of \"Amount of Banknotes in Circulation\" accurately reflects the meaning of \"流通金額.\" The punctuation and formatting are also appropriate for a title or heading.\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Banknotes and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of the Government's Issuance of Circulating Banknotes and Coins at the End of 2024\nFigure 9: Analysis of the Government's Issuance of Circulating Banknotes and Coins at the End of 2024\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\nThe original text is \"# 香港鈔票\", which translates to \"Hong Kong banknotes\" or \"Hong Kong notes\". The dictionary provides multiple acceptable translations for \"香港\" and \"鈔票\", including \"Hong Kong\", \"banknotes\", and \"notes\". All junior translators have correctly used \"Hong Kong\" and \"banknotes\" in their translations, which are the most natural and commonly used terms in this context.\nThe only variation among the translations is the use of a hashtag (#) and capitalization. The hashtag is not present in the original text, so it is unnecessary in the translation. Additionally, while \"Banknotes\" with a capital \"B\" is grammatically correct when referring to a specific type of currency, \"banknotes\" with a lowercase \"b\" is also acceptable and more commonly used in general contexts.\nConsidering these points, the most natural and accurate translation would be \"Hong Kong banknotes\" without a hashtag and with lowercase \"banknotes\". This translation is concise, accurate, and follows standard English usage.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organizing 14 lectures on banknote design and anti-counterfeiting features, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students, with the aim of enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"within the year\" and \"persons\" which are somewhat awkward. \"Help enhance\" is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"helped enhance\" or \"help enhance\" with a subject. The term \"sessions\" is acceptable, but \"bank teller personnel\" is redundant.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"During the year\" and \"HKMA\" which is appropriate. \"Participants\" is better than \"persons.\" The phrase \"helping to enhance\" is grammatically correct. \"Retail establishment cashiers\" is accurate. This translation is concise and fluent.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"Within the year\" and \"lectures\" which is appropriate. \"Over 2,600 participants\" is better than \"more than.\" \"Retail store cashiers\" is slightly less formal than \"retail establishment cashiers.\" The phrase \"helping enhance\" is grammatically correct.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" which is more formal. \"During the year\" is appropriate. \"Over 2,600 participants\" is better than \"more than.\" \"Retail establishment cashiers\" is accurate. \"Which helped enhance\" is grammatically correct.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Similar to the fourth, but uses \"retail shop cashiers\" which is less formal than \"retail establishment cashiers.\" \"Which helped enhance\" is correct.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Contains a major error: \"conclusion\" instead of \"lectures.\" Also, \"attracted\" should be \"attracted\" (not \"attracted\" with a past tense verb). \"Help enhance\" is grammatically incorrect. This translation is the least accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" for brevity, \"during the year\" for clarity, \"lectures\" for accuracy, \"over 2,600 participants\" for natural phrasing, \"retail establishment cashiers\" for formality, and \"which helped enhance\" for grammatical correctness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nDuring the year, the HKMA held 14 lectures on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank tellers, retail establishment cashiers, and students, which helped enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# Coin Collection Initiative\n\nThe original text is a concise statement about the continued popularity of a coin collection initiative and the location of its details in a specific report. The dictionary provides a list of acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"scheme\" for \"計劃\" and \"Sustainable Development\" for the chapter title. However, it omits the name of the organization (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) that is implied in the original text.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"plan\" for \"計劃\" and includes the organization's name in the chapter title. However, the phrase \"under the chapter\" is awkward and not idiomatic in English.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly translates the chapter title as \"Sustainable Banking and Finance,\" which is not supported by the original text. It also uses \"residents\" for \"市民,\" which is less appropriate than \"the public.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Plan\" for \"計劃\" and includes the organization's name in the chapter title. However, it uses \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may be unclear to some readers.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation uses \"Coins collecting plan\" instead of \"Coin Collection Plan,\" which is not idiomatic. It also uses \"Sustainable Development of the Monetary Authority\" for the chapter title, which is not the most natural phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Plan\" for \"計劃\" and includes the organization's name in the chapter title. It also uses \"The 2024 Sustainable Development Report\" with \"The\" before the title, which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Plan\" for \"計劃\" as it is the most natural and formal term in this context.\n- Include the name of the organization (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) in the chapter title.\n- Use \"the public\" for \"市民\" as it is the most appropriate and widely understood term.\n- Use \"included in the chapter titled\" for \"載於...一章\" as it is the most natural and idiomatic phrasing.\n- Ensure that the title of the report is correctly formatted with quotation marks and the year.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Coin Collection Plan continues to be popular among the public. Details of the plan are included in the chapter titled \"Sustainable Development at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in the \"2024 Sustainable Development Report.\"\n\n# US Dollar Liquidity Facility\nThe original text is \"# 美元流動資金安排\". The key terms to translate are \"美元\", \"流動\", \"資金\", and \"安排\". According to the dictionary, \"美元\" can be translated as \"US dollar\", \"dollar\", \"US dollars\", \"US dollar-denominated\", or \"US$\". \"流動\" can be \"liquidity\" or \"mobile\". \"資金\" can be \"capital\", \"funds\", \"funding\", \"source of funds\", \"dedicated funds\", or \"liquidity\". \"安排\" can be \"arrangement(s)\", \"Facility\", \"facilitating\", \"arrangements\", \"Arrangements\", \"arrangement\", \"facility\", \"arranged\", or \"arrange\".\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in their use of these terms. The first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"liquidity\" for \"流動\" and \"arrangements\" for \"安排\", which is a valid choice. The second and fifth translations use \"Liquidity Arrangement\" and \"Liquidity Facility\" respectively, which are also valid. The third translation uses \"Funds\" for \"資金\", which is also a valid choice.\nHowever, the best translation would be \"US Dollar Liquidity Facility\". This translation uses \"US Dollar\" for \"美元\", \"Liquidity\" for \"流動\", and \"Facility\" for \"安排\", which are all valid choices from the dictionary. It is also the most concise and natural-sounding translation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"美元\" as \"US dollar,\" \"資金\" as \"liquidity,\" and \"持牌\" as \"licensed.\" However, some translations use \"HKMA\" without fully spelling it out, which may be less formal or less clear for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n2. **Fluency and Naturalness**: The translations vary in fluency. For example, the first translation uses \"effective May 24\" which is natural, while the sixth uses \"which will take effect on May 24,\" which is slightly more wordy. The fifth translation uses \"given the United States’ implementation,\" which is more formal and precise than \"in the situation where the US will start implementing.\"\n3. **Tense and Clarity**: Some translations use \"has introduced\" or \"launched,\" which is appropriate. However, the sixth translation uses \"will start implementing,\" which may imply a future action that is not clearly stated in the original text. The original text states that the US \"starts\" implementing the change on May 28, which is a factual statement, not a prediction.\n4. **Word Choice and Precision**: The term \"恆常\" is translated as \"standing\" in most translations, which is accurate. However, \"ongoing\" (used in the second translation) is less precise. \"Standing\" better reflects the idea of a permanent or regular facility.\n5. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate for a financial context. However, the use of \"backup liquidity\" is more natural than \"backup source of liquidity\" or \"backup liquidity to licensed banks.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced enhancements to its US dollar liquidity facility, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing liquidity facility provides backup liquidity to licensed banks when needed, particularly in the context of the US implementing a shortened settlement cycle to T+1 on May 28.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Scheme continues to operate smoothly. As at the end of 2024, the nominal aggregate value of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds was about HK$1,306.8 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Currency Research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre (Research Centre), under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Research Centre also shared its research findings with a global audience through five issues of an open-access electronic journal. In addition, the Research Centre published two issues of \"Insights from Monetary Research,\" providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of its recently published research papers.\n\nIn addition to research work, the Research Centre organised a range of knowledge exchange activities to promote engagement with diverse participants. During the year, 31 workshops or online seminars were held for local participants, exploring important monetary and financial research topics. At the international level, the Finance Academy, in collaboration with the Research Centre, academic institutions, central banks of various countries, and international financial institutions, organised four International Conferences and five workshops or roundtable meetings, promoting dialogue and exchange on a wide range of economic and financial affairs.\n\nThese international activities include:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent in meaning and structure. However, there are a few points worth noting:\n1. **Capitalization of \"International\"**: The first and fourth translations use \"International\" with a capital \"I\", while the others use \"international\" with a lowercase \"i\". In English, unless it's part of a proper noun or title, \"international\" should be lowercase. Therefore, the second, third, fifth, and sixth translations are more appropriate in this context.\n2. **Use of \"include\"**: All translations use \"include\" correctly. However, the dictionary provides several alternatives such as \"comprise,\" \"consist of,\" and \"including...\" which could add variety and nuance. For example, \"comprise\" might be more precise in this context, as it implies that the listed items are the whole or entirety of the category.\n3. **Fluency and Naturalness**: The translations are all grammatically correct and fluent. However, the phrase \"These international activities include:\" is somewhat abrupt and could be improved for better flow, especially if followed by a list of activities.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate and do not require any adaptation for English-speaking audiences.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would use \"international\" with a lowercase \"i\" for consistency with standard English usage, and possibly use a more precise verb such as \"comprise\" to enhance clarity and formality. Additionally, the sentence could be slightly rephrased for better flow and completeness.\nThese international activities comprise:\n\nApril 11\n\nCo-organised with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nThe original phrase \"與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\" translates to \"co-organised with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\" The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the key terms, and the best choice is \"co-organised\" for \"合辦\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"\nThe first, second, and fifth translations are the most accurate and fluent. They correctly use \"co-organised\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\" The third translation uses \"co-organise\" instead of \"co-organised,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context. The fourth translation uses \"Hong Kong university\" without the full name, which is less formal and less precise. The sixth translation uses \"co-host\" instead of \"co-organise,\" which is a less accurate term for the context of an event or initiative being jointly organised.\nThe best translation should use \"co-organised\" to match the past tense and the nature of the event, and it should use the full and official name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This ensures clarity, professionalism, and accuracy in the translation.\n\nJune 6–7 “NBER East Asia Economic Workshop 2024”\n\nWith the original text being \"與美國全國經濟研究所、國際結算銀行及香港科技大學商學院合辦,\" the goal is to translate it accurately and fluently into English, ensuring that all terms in the dictionary are translated using the appropriate English alternatives.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"National Institute of Economic Research\" (not in the dictionary), \"International banks\" (incorrect; should be \"International Settlement Bank\"), and \"Hong Kong University\" (should be \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"). The translation is inaccurate and lacks proper terminology.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"National Economic Research Institute of the United States\" (not in the dictionary), \"International Settlement Bank\" (correct), and \"Hong Kong University of Technology Business School\" (incorrect; should be \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"). The translation is partially correct but has terminology errors.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"National Bureau of Economic Research\" (not in the dictionary), \"International Settlements Bank\" (should be \"International Settlement Bank\"), and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\" (correct). The translation is mostly correct but has minor terminology issues.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"National Bureau of Economic Research\" (not in the dictionary), \"International Settlement Bank\" (correct), and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\" (correct). The translation is mostly correct but has a terminology issue with \"National Bureau of Economic Research.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"National Institute of Economic Research\" (not in the dictionary), \"International Settlement Bank\" (correct), and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School\" (correct). The translation is mostly correct but has a terminology issue with \"National Institute of Economic Research.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"National Economic Institute\" (not in the dictionary), \"International settlement bank(s)\" (should be \"International Settlement Bank\"), and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\" (correct). The translation is mostly correct but has terminology issues.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe correct translation should use \"the US National Bureau of Economic Research\" (though not in the dictionary, it is the most accurate term for the entity), \"International Settlement Bank,\" and \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School.\" The verb \"co-organise\" is appropriate for \"合辦.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nCo-organised with the US National Bureau of Economic Research, the International Settlement Bank, and the Business School of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJuly 15 to 16\nThe original text \"7月15至16日\" translates to \"July 15 to 16\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), but in this context, the most appropriate translations are \"July\" for \"7月\" and \"15 to 16\" for \"15至16日.\" The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, with the exception of the second translator who incorrectly added \"days\" at the end, which is not present in the original text. The third and fifth translators used \"15th to 16th,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than necessary for a simple date range. The best translation is \"July 15 to 16,\" which is concise, accurate, and natural in English.\n\nCo-organised with the Fund, the International Clearing Bank, and the ASEAN and China-Japan-South Korea Macroeconomic Research Office.\n\nOctober 14 to 15\nThe original text \"10月14至15日\" is a date range expressed in Traditional Chinese. The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), including \"October\" for \"10月\" and \"day\" or \"days\" for \"日.\" The junior translators have mostly translated the date correctly as \"October 14 to 15,\" which is concise and natural in English. However, the third junior translator added \"days\" at the end, which is unnecessary and slightly awkward. The fifth junior translator used the abbreviation \"Oct\" instead of \"October,\" which is acceptable in informal contexts but less formal than the full month name.\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and consistent with standard English date formatting. Using \"October\" is more formal and widely understood than \"Oct,\" and omitting \"days\" at the end avoids redundancy. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"October 14 to 15.\"\n\nThe 14th Annual International Conference on the Evolution of China and Global Trade Structures: Challenges and Opportunities\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表

支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2.

銀行體系穩定\". The dictionary provides several options for \"穩定\" (stability, stable, resilient, financial stability, soundness, safe and sound, integrity, stabilisation) and specifies that \"銀行體\" should be translated as \"banking sector\".\nReview of the junior translations:\n1. **#BankingSectorStability** – This is overly capitalized and lacks proper spacing. It reads like a hashtag rather than a title or phrase. It also merges \"banking sector\" and \"stability\" without a space, which is ungrammatical in English.\n2. **banking sector stability** – This is grammatically correct and uses the exact term \"banking sector\" from the dictionary. It is also the most natural and fluent translation.\n3. **Banking Sector Stability** – This is similar to the second translation but with title case. While not incorrect, it is less common in standard English unless used as a heading or title.\n4. **Banking sector stability** – Identical to the second translation, which is appropriate and natural.\n5. **Banking system stability** – This uses \"system\" instead of \"sector\" as specified in the dictionary. While \"system\" is a related term, it is not the exact translation provided for \"銀行體\", which is \"banking sector\".\n6. **Banking sector stability** – Same as translation 2 and 4, which are both accurate and natural.\n**Reasoning for improvement:** The best translation should use the exact term \"banking sector\" from the dictionary and maintain a natural, fluent structure. The phrase \"banking sector stability\" is the most accurate and natural translation. It avoids unnecessary capitalization and adheres to the dictionary's specifications. \"Banking system stability\" is incorrect because it uses \"system\" instead of \"sector\" as specified in the dictionary.\n**Improved translation:** Banking sector stability\n\nDespite facing macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2024. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based supervision and contingency planning, safeguarded the stability of the banking system. It also provided regulatory guidance and supported the industry in responding to emerging risks, in order to enhance the operational resilience and cyber defense resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry projects, including a generative artificial intelligence \"sandbox.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the term \"Consumer Protection Against Scams Charter 2.0\" or similar, aligning with the dictionary entry for \"詐騙\" (scam\/fraud) and \"約章\" (Charter).\n- The term \"SmartSafe Deposit\" is consistently used, matching the dictionary entry for \"協助\" (assist\/support) and \"存款\" (deposit).\n- The term \"cooling-off period\" is accurately used for \"冷靜期,\" and \"unsecured consumer credit products\" aligns with \"無抵押消費信貸產品.\"\n- The term \"generative artificial intelligence\" is correctly used for \"生成式人工智能.\"\n- The term \"cross-border\" is appropriately used for \"跨境,\" and \"Wealth Management Connect\" is correctly used for \"理財通.\"\n- The term \"digital asset-related activities\" aligns with \"數碼資產相關活動.\"\n- The term \"Credit Information Link\" or similar is used for \"信資通,\" though the exact term may vary slightly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Smart Deposit\" instead of \"SmartSafe Deposit,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary entry for \"協助\" (assist\/support).\n- Some translations use \"Credit Information Service (CIS)\" or \"Credit Reference Connect\" instead of \"信資通,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary.\n- Some translations use \"cross-boundary\" instead of \"cross-border,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary.\n- Some translations use \"CreditInfo\" or \"Credit Reference Connect\" instead of \"信資通,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary.\n- Some translations use \"Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme\" instead of \"Wealth Management Connect (WMC)\" or \"Pilot Scheme,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary.\n- Some translations use \"Credit Information Link\" instead of \"信資通,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Consumer Protection Against Scams Charter 2.0\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"SmartSafe Deposit\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"unsecured consumer credit products\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"generative artificial intelligence\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"cross-border\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Wealth Management Connect (WMC)\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"digital asset-related activities\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Credit Information Link\" or \"信資通\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Pilot Scheme\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"customer-facing services\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"enhance customer experience\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"investment and insurance products\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"personal credit reference services\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"within the year\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the \"Consumer Protection Against Scams Charter 2.0\" to enhance consumer protection in banking. We have also introduced \"SmartSafe Deposit\" to assist depositors in effectively protecting their deposits, as well as a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA provides guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services, and offers an additional payment arrangement for secondary property transactions, working closely with the industry. The HKMA also enhances customer experience by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the pilot scheme for Wealth Management Connect (WMC), and simplifying the procedures for selling investment and insurance products, while simultaneously ensuring investor protection. The full transition of personal credit reference services to \"Credit Information Link\" will be completed within the year.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use terms from the dictionary, such as \"suspicious\" for \"可疑\", \"monetary\" for \"錢\", \"support\" for \"支持\", and \"mechanism\" for \"機制\". However, some translations use \"Anti-Money Laundering\" for \"洗\" instead of \"Anti-\", which is not strictly adhering to the dictionary's instruction to use one of the listed alternatives. The dictionary lists \"Anti-\" as an option, so \"Anti-Money Laundering\" is acceptable but not strictly necessary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations vary in fluency. The first, fourth, and sixth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The second and third translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"the'suspicious account alert' mechanism\" (missing a space) and \"the Financial Intelligence Unit's anti-fraud and money laundering working group\" (not directly supported by the original text).\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard English terms for financial and legal contexts. However, the use of \"HKMA\" in some translations is inconsistent, with some using it and others not.\n4. **Specific Improvements**: The phrase \"intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports\" is more precise than \"suspicious transaction reporting led by intelligence.\" Also, \"proceeds frozen or confiscated\" is more natural than \"criminal proceeds that were frozen or confiscated.\" The term \"legislative changes\" is more appropriate than \"legislative revisions\" in some contexts.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent translations while ensuring strict adherence to the dictionary and improving clarity and precision.\nThe improved translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a key role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. By increasing the speed and volume of intelligence sharing through the Anti-Scam and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023, prompting a 34% increase in criminal proceeds frozen or confiscated. The consultation on legislative changes to promote banks’ sharing of information to assist in detecting and preventing financial crime received widespread support. In April, the HKMA provided guidance based on the findings of a special review of the transaction monitoring system, and in September launched a plan to promote the industry’s application of artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious activities. The HKMA also collaborates with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimize the “suspicious account alert” mechanism and strengthen promotional efforts, and issues guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and disrupting authorized payment scams.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee has optimized various aspects of the deposit protection scheme to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has implemented resolution standards, requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in formulating banks' preferred resolution strategies, addressing barriers to resolvability to ensure adequate financial resources and the continuity of operations during resolution, as well as enhancing the execution capabilities of resolution.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the HKMA's objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this objective, it is essential to establish and maintain a financial system with a high degree of resilience that can provide the critical financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may impact the stability of the financial system through their operational methods, or even in extreme situations due to disorderly failure. As the regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the resilience to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” In fact, as a resolution authority, the Monetary Authority seeks to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be orderly resolved. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions. To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate barriers to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the Monetary Authority’s operational capacity to resolve authorized institutions on the brink of failure. To effectively carry out the above tasks, the Monetary Authority adopts methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"specifying and monitoring\" and \"safeguard\" as per the dictionary. However, \"prevent disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructure from affecting their stability\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"has responsibility\" and \"safeguard\" appropriately. However, \"prevent their stability from being affected due to disruptions\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has a grammatical error: \"specified and monitoring\" should be \"specifying and monitoring.\" It also uses \"protect\" instead of \"safeguard\" and \"currency\" instead of \"monetary and financial systems,\" which is not fully aligned with the dictionary options.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is concise and grammatically correct. It uses \"safeguard\" and \"operational disruptions\" effectively. However, \"preventing operational disruptions from affecting its stability\" is slightly less precise than \"preventing disruptions in the operation... from affecting their stability.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"designating\" instead of \"specifying,\" which is an acceptable alternative from the dictionary. It also uses \"protect\" and \"system(s)\" appropriately. However, \"prevent disruptions to their operations from affecting its stability\" is slightly ambiguous in pronoun reference.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"specifying,\" \"safeguard,\" and \"impact on its stability\" correctly. However, \"currency and financial system\" is slightly narrower than \"monetary and financial systems\" as per the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"specifying\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"safeguard\" instead of \"protect\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n- Use \"monetary and financial systems\" to align with the dictionary.\n- Use \"preventing disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructure from affecting their stability\" for clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for specifying and monitoring certain financial market infrastructure. The purpose of the HKMA's monitoring of financial market infrastructure is to promote the overall safety and efficiency of the relevant infrastructure, reduce systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Enhancing the resilience of financial market infrastructure against financial crises can safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, preventing disruptions in the operation of financial market infrastructure from affecting their stability.\n\n# 2024 Annual Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) granted banking licenses to a bank established as a corporation in Hong Kong and a bank established as a corporation outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also approved a trading broker established outside Hong Kong to become a currency broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, one bank with a restricted license, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor further information on authorized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices (pages 311 to 314) and Tables D to F (pages 320 to 323).\n\n# Review of the Three-Level Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed a public consultation related to streamlining the three-tier banking system to a two-tier system. Respondents generally supported the proposed streamlining. After considering the feedback received, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority proposed several new key issues to streamline the transition process and reduce the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# \"Virtual Bank\" Rebranded\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed the public consultation on renaming \"Virtual Bank\" to \"Digital Bank.\" The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the HKMA therefore revised the statutory guidelines \"Authorization of Digital Banks\" in October, with the proposal officially taking effect.\n\n# Review of Digital Banking\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banking, with the review report published in August. The review shows that the development of digital banking to date has achieved the three policy objectives for introducing digital banking in Hong Kong, namely promoting fintech and innovation, providing new customer experiences, and promoting financial inclusion. Under the diversified development of digital and traditional banking, the HKMA considers the current number of digital banking licenses to be appropriate, and at this stage, there is no need to introduce more new digital banking participants into the market. The revised guidelines \"Authorization of Digital Banking,\" issued in October, relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking services beyond retail banking, and establishing physical branches in situations deemed reasonable from the perspective of customer experience and business strategy, provided that digital banks continue to primarily offer banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Banking License Fees\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority completed its review of licensing fees within the year and raised the fee level in June.\n\n# Hong Kong's Company Migration System\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original text is \"# 香港的公司遷冊制度\", which translates to \"Hong Kong's Company Migration System\" when using the dictionary terms. The junior translators have produced several variations, but most have issues with either incorrect term usage or awkward phrasing.\nThe first translation, \"Hong Kong’s company migration System\", is mostly correct but has inconsistent capitalization. The second translation, \"Hong Kong's Company Migration Incorporated System\", incorrectly uses \"Incorporated\" instead of \"System\" from the dictionary. The third translation, \"Hong Kong’s company migration system\", is correct in terms of vocabulary and grammar but lacks the proper capitalization for \"system\" as it appears in the dictionary. The fourth translation, \"Hong Kong's Company Incorporation System\", incorrectly uses \"Incorporation\" instead of \"Migration\" from the dictionary. The fifth translation, \"# Hong Kong's Company Migration System\", is correct but includes the hashtag which is not present in the original text. The sixth translation, \"# Hong Kong's Company Migration Incorporation System\", is incorrect as it combines \"Migration\" and \"Incorporation\" from the dictionary, which are separate terms.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Hong Kong's Company Migration System\" as it accurately reflects the original text using the correct terms from the dictionary and maintains proper grammar and capitalization.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing support to the government in introducing a company migration system, including legislative assistance related to the Banking Ordinance and other relevant legislation. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"company registry migration system,\" which is slightly off. \"Registry\" is not in the dictionary, and \"migration system\" is not the best term for \"遷冊制度.\" Also, \"revising\" is not the best match for \"修訂.\"\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"company incorporation migration system,\" which is more accurate than \"registry.\" However, \"incorporation migration\" may be confusing. \"Amending\" is a good choice for \"修訂.\"\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"company migration regime,\" which is a strong term for \"遷冊制度.\" It also correctly uses \"amending\" and \"subsidiary legislation.\" However, it omits \"procedures\" in the legislative part.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Similar to the third, but it correctly includes \"legislative procedures\" and uses \"amending\" for \"修訂.\" It is very close to the ideal translation.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"banking legislation\" instead of \"banking sector\" or \"banking industry,\" which is acceptable but less precise. It also uses \"amendments\" for \"修訂,\" which is correct.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"company migration arrangements,\" which is a good term. However, \"banking sector’s legislation\" is not the best match for \"銀行業條例.\" Also, \"related legislation\" is vague.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the full name.\n- Use \"company migration regime\" for \"公司遷冊制度.\"\n- Use \"amending\" for \"修訂.\"\n- Use \"subsidiary legislation\" for \"附屬法例.\"\n- Use \"legislative procedures\" for \"程序.\"\n- Use \"banking sector\" for \"銀行業.\"\n- Use \"related to the HKMA\" for \"有關金管局.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) provides support to the Government in introducing a company migration regime in Hong Kong, including assisting with the legislative procedures for amending the Banking Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, as well as other legislation related to the HKMA.\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 174 off-site reviews, covering a wide scope, including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, and risk management. To continue strengthening the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the board, and held 38 tripartite meetings in co-operation with authorized institutions and their external auditors. In addition, the HKMA conducted on-site reviews of various business operations of authorized institutions, including governance and practices relating to credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the original text and the dictionary of terms, the translations by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"業務\" as \"business\" or \"tasks,\" \"風險\" as \"risk(s),\" and \"機構\" as \"institutions.\"\n- Most translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the emphasis on technology application, risk management, and the recognition of the HKMA.\n- The use of \"enhance their ability to respond to climate change\" is consistent across several translations and is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have minor grammatical issues, such as \"to enhance their resilience to climate changing\" (should be \"climate change\") in Translation 4.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Business operational risk\" in Translation 2 is awkward; \"operational risk\" alone is sufficient.\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which should be consistent.\n- **Dictionary Use:** \"鑑\" is not found in the dictionary, but it is part of the phrase \"鑑於,\" which is best translated as \"Given that\" or \"In view of.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"The AsianBanker\" should be \"The Asian Banker\" with a space, as per the dictionary entry for \"銀行\" (banking).\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n- Use \"Given that\" for \"鑑於.\"\n- Use \"operational risk and technology risk management\" for \"業務操作風險及科技風險管理.\"\n- Use \"further strengthened\" for \"亦進一步加強.\"\n- Use \"enhance their ability to respond to climate change\" for \"提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力.\"\n- Use \"The Asian Banker\" with a space, as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure consistency in referring to the HKMA as \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"HKMA\" throughout the translation.\n- Use \"resilient\" for \"穩健\" in the context of economic growth.\n- Use \"amid an uncertain global economic environment\" for \"在全球經濟不明朗的環境下.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nGiven that the application of technology by authorized institutions is becoming increasingly prevalent, operational risk and technology risk management have become another regulatory focus. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also further strengthened its supervision of climate risk management by authorized institutions, aiming to enhance their ability to respond to climate change. The HKMA’s work in maintaining financial stability and promoting resilient economic growth amid an uncertain global economic environment has been recognized, and it was awarded \"Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific\" by The Asian Banker.\n\nAssistant Chief Executive (Banking Supervision) Ms. Zhu Liqiao, on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the “Asia-Pacific Region Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Institution Award” presented by The Asian Banker.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts on-site reviews of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses, as well as consumer protection matters, and uses thematic assessments as a complement to examine new projects or areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 sets out an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1 Regulatory Work Overview\n\na. Additional supervisory work focused on operational resilience includes an HKMA investigation and authorized institutions conducting self-assessments to review implementation progress and identify areas needing improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at the bilateral and industry levels regarding the development of frameworks and practices.  \nb. In addition, supervisory work focuses on assessing the strategies and approaches of authorized institutions in approving specific credit portfolios and managing ongoing risks, such as commercial property and SME loans.  \nc. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the HKMA's \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" module GS-1 \"Climate Risk Management.\"\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe original title, \"信貸增長及資產質素,\" is a concise and formal heading typically used in financial or economic contexts. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the overall presentation.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol at the beginning, which is consistent with the original text's formatting. However, in standard English headings, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used unless it is part of a specific formatting convention (e.g., in markdown or online content). The third and fifth translations omit the \"#\" symbol, which may be more appropriate for a formal or academic context.\nIn terms of translation accuracy, all versions correctly use \"Credit Growth\" and \"Asset Quality\" as translations for \"信貸增長及資產質素.\" The word \"asset\" is appropriately translated as \"asset(s),\" and \"quality\" is the most natural and commonly used term for \"質素\" in this context.\nThe only minor difference is the presence or absence of a period at the end of the title in the fifth translation. While this is not a major issue, it is more consistent with formal writing to include a period if the title is treated as a complete sentence.\nConsidering these observations, the most appropriate translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol for consistency with the original formatting and to include a period at the end of the title for grammatical completeness. Therefore, the best possible translation is:\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality.\n\nThe total amount of loans decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared to a decline of 3.6% in 2023. Table 2 sets out the growth situation of various loans and advances. The total amount of related loans in Mainland China decreased by 8.7% to HK$385.9 billion in 2024 (Table 3).\n\nGiven that interest rates remain high, some Mainland real estate developers' debt issues have not been fully alleviated, and the local commercial real estate market remains weak, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. Throughout the year, the banking system's asset quality continued to face pressure, but the risk situation remained manageable. The sector-specific classified loan ratio of the banking system at the end of 2024 was 1.96%, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the sector-specific classified loan ratio for related loans in Mainland China during the same period fell from 2.58% to 2.38%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a special assessment to review the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with key areas including exposure to risks in more vulnerable industries, secured loans to private banks and wealth management clients, unsecured retail loans, monitoring of credit risks related to offshore business, and exposure to risks in non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms and translated them appropriately, with only minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. The term \"表\" is translated as \"Table,\" which is correct. \"貸款\" is translated as \"Loans,\" which is an appropriate choice from the provided dictionary options. \"增長\" is translated as \"Growth,\" which is also a suitable choice. \"墊款\" is translated as \"Advances,\" which is accurate and commonly used in financial contexts.\nThe only variation among the translations is the use of a colon (\":\") after \"Table 2\" and the capitalization of \"Loans and Advances.\" In formal or professional contexts, it is standard to use a colon after the table number and to capitalize the title of the table. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances.\" This format is consistent with standard English table titles and ensures clarity and professionalism.\n\nTable 3 Mainland Related Loan Growth\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Alleviate pressure on bank customers' cash flow\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"alleviate\" and \"pressure\" from the dictionary, and the structure is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Cash flow\" is not in the dictionary; \"資金流\" should be translated as \"funds flow\" or \"capital flow\" based on the dictionary. Also, \"bank customers\" is acceptable but could be more formal.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Alleviating the funding pressure on bank customers.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"funding\" and \"pressure\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Funding pressure\" is not the exact phrase in the original. \"資金流壓力\" should be \"funds flow pressure\" or \"capital flow pressure.\" Also, the use of \"alleviating\" is correct but could be more precise.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Alleviating funding pressures on bank customers.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"funding\" and \"pressures\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to Translation 2, \"funding pressures\" is not the exact phrase. \"資金流壓力\" should be \"funds flow pressure\" or \"capital flow pressure.\" The use of \"pressures\" is acceptable but not the best fit.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Alleviate the pressure on bank customers' cash flow.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"alleviate\" and \"pressure\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as Translation 1, \"cash flow\" is not in the dictionary. \"資金流\" should be translated as \"funds flow\" or \"capital flow.\"\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Alleviating Bank Customers' Funds Flow Pressure\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"alleviating,\" \"funds flow,\" and \"pressure\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title format is awkward and not natural in English. \"Bank Customers\" should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"# Alleviating the Capital Flow Pressure on Bank Customers\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"capital flow\" and \"pressure\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"#\" is unnecessary unless it's a heading. \"Capital flow\" is a valid translation for \"資金流,\" but \"funds flow\" might be more appropriate in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe phrase \"資金流壓力\" should be translated as \"funds flow pressure\" or \"capital flow pressure.\" \"Funds\" is more appropriate in this context than \"capital,\" as it refers to the movement of money rather than financial assets. \"Pressure\" is the best fit for \"壓力\" in this context. \"Bank customers\" is the most natural and formal translation for \"銀行客戶.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nAlleviating funds flow pressure on bank customers.\n\n# Support local SMEs\n# 支持本地中小企\nThe original text is a short title or heading, likely used in a policy statement, government initiative, or business context. The dictionary provides specific translations for certain terms, and the task is to ensure that these are used accurately.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"Support local SMEs\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of dictionary terms (\"支持\" → \"Support\", \"本地\" → \"local\", \"中小企\" → \"SMEs\").  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag (#) present in the original, which may be important for formatting or social media use.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# Support Local SMEs\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the hashtag and capitalizes \"Local\" as per the dictionary's \"Local\" option.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Local\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's part of a title or proper noun, which it is not in this context.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"Support local SMEs.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The period at the end is unnecessary for a title or heading.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# Support for Local SMEs\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes the hashtag and uses \"Support for\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Local\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"for\" adds a nuance not present in the original.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"Support local SMEs\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag, which may be important for context.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"Support local SMEs\"**  \n   - **Same as Translation 1 and 5.**\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe original text includes a hashtag (#), which is likely important for formatting or social media use. The dictionary provides \"Support\" as a valid translation for \"支持\" and \"local\" for \"本地\", with \"SMEs\" for \"中小企\". The hashtag should be retained, and \"Support\" should be capitalized as it is the start of the phrase following the hashtag. The period at the end is unnecessary for a heading. \"Local\" should not be capitalized unless it is part of a proper noun or title, which it is not in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Support local SMEs\n\nSMEs are an important cornerstone of Hong Kong's economy, and the HKMA has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing. Since the HKMA and the banking sector established the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" (SME Coordination Mechanism) in 2019, multiple rounds of SME support measures have been launched, including the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" Scheme, to assist SMEs in overcoming the difficulties during the pandemic period.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector launched additional measures to support SMEs still facing challenges in their operating situations due to economic transformation, and to assist SMEs in continued development and upgrading transformation.\n\n# New support measures for SMEs.\n# New SME Support Measures\nThe original text is a heading: \"# 新的中小企支持措施\". The key terms are \"新的\" (new), \"中小企\" (SMEs), \"支持\" (support), and \"措施\" (measures). According to the dictionary, \"支持\" should be translated as one of: \"support\", \"provided\", \"supporting\", \"backing\", \"backed\", \"Backed\", \"Support\", \"back\". The best choice in this context is \"support\". \"措施\" should be translated as one of: \"measures\", \"initiatives\", \"policy measures\", \"arrangements\", \"action\", \"controls\", \"mitigating strategies\". The best choice is \"measures\". \"中小企\" is defined as \"SMEs\" in the dictionary. \"新\" should be translated as \"new\" or \"novel\", with \"new\" being the more natural choice in this context.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but they vary in formatting and punctuation. The first and fifth translations use \"New support measures for SMEs\", which is grammatically correct and natural. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"# New SME Support Measures\", which is also correct but includes a hashtag, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context. The third translation is similar to the first and fifth but omits the article \"the\" and the preposition \"for\", making it slightly less natural.\nThe best possible translation would be \"New SME Support Measures\" or \"New support measures for SMEs\", depending on whether the heading should be concise or more descriptive. Given that the original text is a heading, \"New SME Support Measures\" is likely the most appropriate, as it is concise and commonly used in such contexts.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched nine measures through the SME Coordination Mechanism in March to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing and to support their continued development.\n\nNine initiatives to support SMEs announced in March.\n\n1. Do not require mortgage customers to make early repayments.  \n2. Adjust credit limits and provide customers with a minimum six-month transition period.\n"}

於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    - 開始探索以央行數碼貨幣支持香港代幣化市場的發展；\n- 透過「商業數據通」便利中小企借貸；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n「轉數快」的使用在2024年繼續增加，登記數目與交易量在過去六年穩步上升。截至2024年底，「轉數快」登記數目增至1,580萬個，全年每日平均交易宗數較上年上升33%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量持續增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監管15項持牌儲值支付工具（其中四項由持牌銀行發行）。年內金管局繼續與業界緊密合作，因應詐騙風險上升加強管控措施及保障消費者。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局就在香港實施穩定幣發行人監管制度的立法建議，於2月完成為期兩個月的公眾諮詢後，於7月聯合發表諮詢總結，並於12月將《穩定幣條例草案》提交立法會審議。為更了解穩定幣發行人的業務模式，並制定適切的監管制度，金管局亦推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，並於7月公布三間進入「沙盒」的參與機構。與此同時，金管局繼續積極參與國際組織在數碼資產相關課題（包括穩定幣及代幣化）的工作，確保相關監管框架符合國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n#

status\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are some nuances and stylistic considerations that can be improved upon.\nFirstly, the use of \"status\" as the translation for \"地位\" is appropriate, as it conveys the idea of a position or standing. However, \"status\" can sometimes be perceived as more formal or bureaucratic, whereas \"standing\" or \"role\" might offer a slightly different nuance depending on context.\nSecondly, the translations vary in their use of \"Hong Kong.\" While \"Hong Kong’s\" is the most common and natural choice, \"in Hong Kong\" or \"Hong Kong-based\" might be less appropriate in this context, as the original text refers to Hong Kong itself, not something based in Hong Kong.\nThirdly, the capitalization of \"International Financial Centre\" in some translations may be unnecessary unless it is a proper noun or title. In this case, it is more natural to use lowercase unless it is part of an official title.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be one that uses \"status\" for \"地位,\" \"Hong Kong’s\" for \"香港,\" and \"international financial centre\" for \"國際金融中心.\" This translation would be both accurate and natural in English.\nHong Kong’s international financial centre status\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局於2024年在加強香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The HKMA has made significant progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a global financial centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of \"position\" for \"地位\", \"global financial centre\" for \"國際金融中心\", and correct placement of \"2024\".  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"具全球競爭力\" is omitted, which is critical to the meaning. The phrase \"as a global financial centre\" lacks the nuance of competitiveness.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong's status as an internationally competitive financial centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Includes \"internationally competitive\" for \"具全球競爭力\", and uses \"status\" for \"地位\".  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"made\" is in past tense, but the original uses \"取得重要進展\" (has made), which is more present perfect. Also, \"financial centre\" is lowercase, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Financial Centre\".\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial centre in 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly includes \"globally competitive\" and \"international financial centre\", and places \"2024\" at the end.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"made\" is again in past tense, and \"financial centre\" is lowercase.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre with global competitiveness.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"with global competitiveness\" for \"具全球競爭力\", and includes \"2024\" in the correct position.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"made\" is in past tense, and \"financial centre\" is lowercase.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a globally competitive international financial centre in 2024.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"position\" for \"地位\", \"globally competitive international financial centre\" for the full phrase, and places \"2024\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"made\" is in past tense, and \"financial centre\" is lowercase.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The HKMA has made important progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a global competitive Financial Centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"has made\" (present perfect), \"status\" for \"地位\", and \"Financial Centre\" (capitalized).  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"global competitive\" is awkward phrasing; \"global competitiveness\" would be better. Also, \"Financial Centre\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **Tense**: The original uses \"取得重要進展\" (has made), which is present perfect, so \"has made\" is more accurate than \"made\".\n- **\"地位\"**: Should be translated as \"status\" or \"position\", both are acceptable, but \"status\" is more formal and fits well in this context.\n- **\"具全球競爭力\"**: Should be translated as \"with global competitiveness\" or \"globally competitive\", both are acceptable, but \"globally competitive\" is more concise and natural.\n- **\"國際金融中心\"**: Should be \"international financial centre\" or \"Financial Centre\", with the latter being more formal and capitalized.\n- **\"2024\"**: Should be placed after the verb for clarity and natural flow.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"Wealth Management Connect,\" \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" \"RMB Liquidity,\" and \"offshore renminbi business hub.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"HKMA,\" \"Mainland,\" and \"collateral.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" instead of \"Cross-border,\" which is less standard in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Swap Connect\" instead of \"Bond Connect\" for \"北向互換通,\" which is incorrect. The correct term is \"Northbound Bond Connect.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"linkage and linkage\" redundantly and includes \"Mainland China\" instead of \"Mainland,\" which is unnecessarily verbose.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"improving the primary liquidity providers' arrangements\" instead of \"enhancing the primary liquidity provider arrangement,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"introduce a range of measures aimed at\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"launched a series of measures to.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Northbound Bond Connect\" but also includes \"enhancements to the 'Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect'\" with \"Cross-boundary,\" which is not the standard term.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct financial terminology as per the dictionary.\n- Maintain fluency and natural English phrasing.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary verbosity.\n- Ensure consistency in terms like \"Northbound Bond Connect\" and \"RMB Liquidity Facility.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various translations while correcting the identified weaknesses.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with relevant authorities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, has launched a series of measures to jointly deepen and expand the connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets, including optimizing the \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\"; expanding the eligible collateral scope for the HKMA's RMB liquidity facility and the \"Northbound Bond Connect\"; optimizing the \"Northbound Bond Connect\"; and enhancing the primary liquidity provider arrangement. These measures help reinforce Hong Kong's gateway role and consolidate its status as a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilience\" for \"穩健\" and \"create a positive ripple effect\" for \"製造正面的漣漪效應.\" It correctly uses \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰.\" However, it uses \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" instead of \"central banks and regulatory organizations\" as per the dictionary, which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"soundness\" for \"穩健\" and \"central banks and supervisory organisations\" for \"央行及監管.\" However, it uses \"Investment Summit\" instead of \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰,\" which is not the most precise term from the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"financial centre\" for \"金融中心\" and \"soundness\" for \"穩健.\" However, it uses \"Investment Summit\" instead of \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰,\" which is not the best match from the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"soundness\" for \"穩健\" and \"Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰.\" It also uses \"regulatory bodies\" for \"組織,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term from the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"soundness\" for \"穩健\" and \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" for \"投資峰.\" It also uses \"regulatory organisations\" for \"組織,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term from the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent.

all dictionary terms are translated correctly and that the English is natural and fluent.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach efforts targeting overseas and mainland stakeholders, enabling them to fully understand the soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third edition of the \"Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" and various other events were successfully held, not only helping to enhance Hong Kong's image as a major international financial centre but also creating a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations, continuing to contribute to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting the development of financial markets.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) progress in various areas of its \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, specifically mentioning central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Fintech 2025\" correctly. The translation is concise and accurate. However, \"Fintech\" is not in the dictionary, but it is a common term and acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is more formal and appropriate in official contexts. \"FinTech 2025\" is also acceptable, though \"Fintech\" is not in the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Incorrectly translates \"2025\" as \"25,\" which is a clear error. This undermines the meaning of the strategy name.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Tech 2025\" instead of \"Fintech 2025,\" which is not standard and less concise. \"Financial Tech\" is not in the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. The term \"Financial Authority\" is not in the dictionary and does not match the original term.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"various areas\" instead of \"all areas,\" which is slightly less precise than the original. However, it is still accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality, as it is more appropriate in official contexts. The term \"Fintech 2025\" is acceptable, though \"Fintech\" is not in the dictionary. However, it is a widely recognized term and does not require a direct translation from the dictionary. The phrase \"central bank digital currency\" is correct, and \"data infrastructure\" is also accurate. The use of \"all areas\" is more precise than \"various areas.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in all areas of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Faster Payment System as \"FPS\" or \"Faster Payment System.\"\n- The term \"金管局\" is consistently translated as \"HKMA\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), which is appropriate.\n- The dictionary term \"推動\" is translated as \"promote\" or \"promoting\" in most translations, which is acceptable.\n- The term \"跨境\" is translated as \"cross-border\" in all translations, which is accurate.\n- The term \"互聯\" is translated as \"linkage\" or \"interconnectivity,\" which aligns with the dictionary options.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Turns Fast\" as a translation for \"轉數快,\" which is not listed in the dictionary and is not an official name of the system. The correct term is \"FPS\" or \"Faster Payment System.\"\n- The term \"交易量\" is translated as \"turnover\" or \"number of transactions.\" While both are acceptable, \"number of transactions\" is more precise in this context.\n- The term \"平均\" is translated as \"average,\" which is correct, but \"average daily\" is more natural than \"whole year average daily.\"\n- The term \"正\" is translated as \"is\" or \"are,\" which is correct, but \"is currently\" is more precise.\n- The term \"人民\" is translated as \"People's\" in \"People's Bank of China,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"內地\" is translated as \"Mainland,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"跨行\" is translated as \"interbank\" or \"bank-to-bank,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"港元\" is translated as \"Hong Kong dollar\" or \"HK$,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"萬\" is translated as \"million,\" which is correct (15.8 million).\n- The term \"年底\" is translated as \"by the end of 2024\" or \"at the end of 2024,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"交易\" is translated as \"transactions,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"系統\" is translated as \"system,\" which is correct.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS\" consistently for \"轉數快.\"\n- Use \"number of transactions\" for \"交易量.\"\n- Use \"average daily\" rather than \"whole year average daily.\"\n- Use \"is currently\" for \"正.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the exact English alternatives provided.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe registration numbers and transaction volume of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" continue to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024, with the average daily number of instant Hong Kong dollar transactions increasing to 1.65 million. The HKMA is currently working closely with the People's Bank of China to promote the implementation of the linkage between Hong Kong's \"FPS\" and the Mainland's interbank online payment clearing system, enabling cross-border payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA continues its efforts to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the tone of official statements. The junior translators have mostly captured the meaning accurately, but there are minor inconsistencies and redundancies that can be refined.\n- **Translation 1, 2, 6:** These are nearly identical and are grammatically correct. They use \"HKMA\" as the translation for \"金管局\" (HKMA is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is the correct entity). The use of \"enhance\" for \"提升\" is appropriate, and \"competitiveness\" for \"競爭力\" is accurate. The phrase \"as an international financial centre\" is well-chosen, with \"financial centre\" matching the dictionary entry. However, \"HKMA\" is not explicitly defined in the original text, so using \"the HKMA\" is acceptable but could be clarified if the audience is not familiar with the term.\n- **Translation 3:** This is very similar to the others, but it uses \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"I\" and \"C.\" While this is not incorrect, it is less common in formal English unless referring to a specific named entity. The lowercase version is more standard in this context.\n- **Translation 4:** This translation has a grammatical error: \"continues strives\" is incorrect. It should be \"continues to strive\" or \"strives to.\"\n- **Translation 5:** This is grammatically correct and uses \"strives\" for \"致力,\" which is a good choice. It also uses \"as an international financial centre,\" which is appropriate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"HKMA\" or \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" depending on the intended audience.\n- Use \"enhance\" or \"strive to enhance\" for \"提升\" based on the tone and formality.\n- Maintain lowercase for \"international financial centre\" unless referring to a specific named entity.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"continues its efforts to enhance\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Best Translation:**\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues its efforts to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"互聯互通機制\" as \"connectivity mechanisms\" or \"cross-border connectivity mechanisms.\"\n- The term \"理財通\" is consistently translated as \"Wealth Management Connect\" or \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- The term \"北向互換通\" is translated as \"Northbound Swap Connect\" or \"Northbound Bond Connect,\" with the former being more accurate based on context.\n- The term \"人民幣流動資金安排\" is translated as \"RMB Liquidity Facility\" or \"RMB liquidity arrangement,\" which aligns with the dictionary entry \"RMB Liquidity.\"\n- The term \"合資格抵押品名單\" is translated as \"eligible collateral list\" or \"list of eligible collateral,\" which is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Mainland\" inconsistently, sometimes using \"the Mainland\" and other times \"Mainland China\" or \"the Mainland.\"\n- The term \"內地政策性銀行\" is translated as \"Mainland policy banks\" in some translations, which is acceptable, but \"domestic policy banks\" is also a valid alternative.\n- The term \"跨境理財通\" is translated as \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" in most translations, which is correct, but \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" is also an option from the dictionary.\n- The term \"靈活\" is translated as \"flexibility\" or \"agility,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"flexibility\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The term \"優化\" is translated as \"enhancements,\" \"optimization,\" or \"upgrading,\" which are all acceptable, but \"optimization\" is more precise in this context.\n- Some translations use \"the two jurisdictions\" or \"both regions\" for \"兩地,\" which is correct, but \"the two sides\" is also a valid alternative.\n- The term \"實施\" is translated as \"implemented\" or \"introduced,\" which is correct, but \"implemented\" is more precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent terminology, especially for key terms like \"北向互換通\" and \"人民幣流動資金安排.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most appropriate and commonly used English equivalents.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent tone, avoiding overly literal translations.\n- Use \"Northbound Swap Connect\" for \"北向互換通\" and \"RMB Liquidity Facility\" for \"人民幣流動資金安排.\"\n- Use \"flexibility\" for \"靈活\" and \"optimization\" for \"優化.\"\n- Use \"the two jurisdictions\" for \"兩地.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded and optimized the cross-border connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the Mainland, helping to consolidate Hong Kong's role as a bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. This year, several optimization measures related to the \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" (Cross-border Wealth Management Connect) were introduced, facilitating cross-border investments for individual investors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). In February, the HKMA included onshore government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China (National Ministry of Finance) and policy financial bonds issued by Mainland policy banks in the eligible collateral list of the RMB Liquidity Facility. In July, relevant authorities in the two jurisdictions announced further support for overseas investors to use onshore bonds held through the \"Bond Connect\" as collateral for transactions under the \"Northbound Swap Connect,\" which will be implemented in January 2025. Additionally, the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" was optimized during the year, increasing investors' flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong's offshore Renminbi business experienced robust growth. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched optimization measures for the primary liquidity providing facility arrangements, including increasing the number of providing banks and expanding the scale of the arrangements. By the end of the year, the nighttime cross-border payment service capability of Hong Kong's Real-Time Gross Settlement system was enhanced to better meet the global demand for cross-border Renminbi payments.\n\nThe HKMA has launched a number of facilitative measures under the financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, including a pilot scheme for cross-border credit information interoperability to promote corporate cross-border financing, as well as cross-border remittance payment arrangements to facilitate Hong Kong residents in purchasing property in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Evergreen,\" \"tokenized bonds,\" and \"Sustainable Finance Action Plan.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main ideas are well conveyed.\n- Most translations use \"one-stop\" for \"一站式\" and \"digital\" for \"數碼,\" which are accurate and natural in context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. For example, the sixth translation says, \"The HKMA continues strives,\" which is incorrect. Similarly, \"the HKMA continues strives\" and \"provides specific objectives to further consolidate Hong Kong as a regional green and sustainable finance hub\" are grammatically incorrect or awkward.\n- **Word Choice:** Some translations use \"facilitative\" or \"convenient\" for \"便利,\" which are acceptable but not always the most natural. \"Facilitated\" or \"facilitative\" may be more appropriate in formal contexts.\n- **Consistency:** The term \"Management Centre\" is used in some translations, but the original text uses \"管理中心,\" which is more commonly translated as \"Management Centre\" or \"Management Center.\" However, the dictionary lists \"Management Centre\" as an option, so it is acceptable.\n- **Tense and Voice:** Some translations use inconsistent verb tenses, such as \"the HKMA is working closely\" or \"the HKMA is continuing to promote,\" which may not match the original's formal tone.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and use the most natural English equivalents for the terms in the dictionary.\n- It should maintain the formal tone of the original text, which is typical of official statements from the HKMA.\n- The translation should avoid awkward phrasing and ensure that all terms are translated consistently and accurately according to the dictionary.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from the junior translations, with corrections for grammar, fluency, and consistency.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to enhance the overall competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong's appeal as a preferred fund management centre and family office business hub, the HKMA closely collaborates with the government and the financial sector to create a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. In addition, the HKMA issued the second batch of tokenized bonds through the Evergreen project and launched the \"EvergreenHub\" one-stop digital bond knowledge repository and the \"Digital Bond Grant Scheme,\" continuing to promote innovation in Hong Kong's bond market. In October, the HKMA announced the \"Sustainable Finance Action Plan,\" providing specific objectives to further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen its market expansion efforts, introducing Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. In November, the HKMA hosted the third edition of the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit, themed \"Sailing Forward Amidst Changing Circumstances,\" brought together leading figures from the global financial industry to share their unique insights. The summit commenced with a keynote speech by Mr. He Lifeng, Deputy Premier of the State Council, followed by a sharing session featuring three Mainland financial regulatory authorities and panel discussions participated in by international financial leaders. The event brought together over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the support and confidence of the global financial community in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also held various other seminars and meetings, including:\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organizing various seminars and meetings during the year. The dictionary provides several options for key terms, and the goal is to ensure that the translation is both accurate and natural in English.\n1. **\"年內\"** – The best translation is \"During the year\" or \"Within the year.\" Both are acceptable, but \"During the year\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n2. **\"金管局\"** – This refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not \"Gold Authority.\" The term \"Gold Authority\" is incorrect and misleading.\n3. **\"亦\"** – \"Also\" or \"In addition\" are appropriate. \"Meanwhile\" is less suitable here as it implies a simultaneous action rather than an additional one.\n4. **\"各項其他研討會及會議\"** – \"Various other seminars and meetings\" is accurate. \"Workshops\" could be used for \"研討會,\" but \"seminars\" is more standard in this context.\n5. **\"舉辦\"** – \"Held\" or \"organised\" are both correct. \"Hold\" is less formal and should be in past tense.\n6. **\"包括\"** – \"Including\" is the most natural and concise choice.\n**Improvements:**\n- Correct the name of the authority to \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"seminars\" for \"研討會\" as it is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- Ensure the verb \"held\" is in the correct past tense.\n- Use \"During the year\" for \"年內\" as it is more natural in formal writing.\n- Avoid \"workshops\" unless the context clearly indicates a hands-on session, which it does not here.\n**Final Translation:**\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also held various other seminars and meetings, including:\n\n- Co-host a joint climate finance conference with the Dubai Financial Services Authority in September;  \n- Co-host the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Global Risk Management Professionals Association in October;  \n- Also co-host an international financial seminar with the Bank for International Settlements in October; and  \n- Host the Financial Stability Council plenary meeting in December, the first of its kind held in Asia since 2016, bringing together leaders and senior officials from financial authorities of more than 50 countries and 12 international standard-setting institutions.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also actively strengthened bilateral ties with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE Central Bank) and the Saudi Central Bank, promoting investment and financial market linkages between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UAE Central Bank to establish cross-border connectivity in debt capital market infrastructure between the two regions and promote cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to strengthen cooperation in the financial services sector between the two regions.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held the seventh Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue in December, discussing topics covering regional and local prospects and policy challenges, as well as the latest developments and potential areas for cooperation in the fields of sustainable finance, financial technology, and market connectivity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"interviewed\" for \"訪問,\" which is not the best fit. \"Visited\" or \"made visits to\" would be more appropriate. It also uses \"co-operation\" with a hyphen, which is less common in modern English.\n2. **Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, using \"visited\" for \"訪問\" and \"financial center\" with a lowercase \"c.\" It correctly uses \"RMB\" and \"local currencies\" and adheres to the dictionary terms.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2, with the only difference being the use of \"the renminbi\" instead of \"RMB.\" While both are acceptable, \"RMB\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n4. **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"5\" instead of \"May\" and \"interviews\" instead of \"visited.\" It also uses \"sent representatives to... for interviews,\" which is awkward and not in line with the original meaning.\n5. **Translation 5** is fluent and accurate, using \"financial center\" with a lowercase \"c\" and \"trade settlements\" instead of \"settlement.\" It also uses \"RMB\" and \"local currencies\" correctly.\n6. **Translation 6** has a minor grammatical issue with \"focused on promoting\" instead of \"focused on the promotion of.\" It also uses \"local currency\" instead of \"local currencies,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"visited\" for \"訪問,\" \"RMB\" for \"人民幣,\" \"local currencies\" for \"本地貨幣,\" and \"financial centre\" with a lowercase \"c\" as per the dictionary. It should also use \"cross-border investment and trade settlement\" and avoid awkward phrasing like \"sent representatives to... for interviews.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA visited Thailand and Malaysia in January and May respectively, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and enterprises to promote Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and further strengthen bilateral financial linkages and cooperation. One of the key areas is promoting the use of RMB and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as Hong Kong's competitive advantages.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking affairs and continues to play a leadership role in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Asia Regional Consultative Group under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and also serves as co-chair of the Financial Innovation Network under the FSB (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the Meeting of Governors of Major Emerging Market Economies under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Peer Review Group on the Crypto-Asset Framework under the FSB. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA has continuously served as chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fintech Promotion Office continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy in collaboration with banking departments, promoting widespread adoption of financial technology across the industry and enhancing Hong Kong's status as a fintech hub in Asia. The key measures to be implemented this year include:\n\n- Further promote the application of financial technology in five key areas by banks, including wealth technology, insurance technology, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology;  \n- Advance work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) to understand its benefits and potential application scenarios, including:  \n    - Advancing the \"Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Cross-border Network\" (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments;  \n    - Further studying the feasibility of issuing \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; and  \n    - Beginning to explore using CBDC to support the development of Hong Kong's tokenized market;  \n- Facilitate SME lending through the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" (CDI);  \n- Strengthen cross-border fintech collaboration; and  \n- Promote broader use of the fast payment system \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is generally accurate but contains several errors. The number \"1,580萬個\" is incorrectly translated as \"10,000,000\" instead of \"15.8 million.\" Also, the phrase \"is providing the impetus for Faster Payment System turnover to continue to grow\" is grammatically awkward and lacks clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is more fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"15.8 million\" and \"FPS\" consistently. However, \"value for Stored Value Facility electronic wallets\" is awkwardly phrased and could be improved for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is very close to the correct translation. It uses \"15.8 million\" and \"FPS\" appropriately. However, \"Commercial payments\" should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun. Also, the phrase \"which are the main reasons driving\" is slightly redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It correctly uses \"15.8 million\" and \"FPS.\" The phrase \"has been the main driver of the continued growth\" is well-structured and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"FPS\" consistently and correctly translates \"15.8 million.\" The phrase \"has been the main driver behind the sustained growth\" is natural and well-structured.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"15.8 million\" and \"FPS\" correctly. However, \"settle payments to merchants\" is slightly more formal than necessary, and \"stored value facilities, electronic money wallets\" could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best elements from the translations include the use of \"FPS\" consistently, the correct number \"15.8 million,\" and the phrase \"main driver of the continued growth.\" However, some phrases can be made more concise and natural. For example, \"top up stored value payment tools, e-wallets, or bank accounts\" can be simplified to \"top up e-wallets or bank accounts via stored value payment tools.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe use of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to increase in 2024, with the number of registrations and transaction volume steadily rising over the past six years. As at the end of 2024, the number of FPS registrations increased to 15.8 million, and the daily average number of transactions for the year rose by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the continued increase in using FPS to pay government bills, pay merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts via stored value payment tools has been the main driver behind the sustained growth in FPS transaction volume.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) monitors six designated retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance) and regulates 15 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks). During the year, the HKMA continued to work closely with the industry to strengthen control measures and consumer protection in response to the rising fraud risks.\n\nThe Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed a two-month public consultation on legislative proposals for implementing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong in February. They jointly published a consultation summary in July and submitted the \"Stablecoin Ordinance Draft\" to the Legislative Council for deliberation in December. To better understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and formulate appropriate regulatory frameworks, the HKMA also launched a \"sandbox\" for stablecoin issuers and announced three participating institutions that had entered the \"sandbox\" in July. Meanwhile, the HKMA continues to actively participate in the work of international organizations on digital asset-related issues (including stablecoins and tokenization), ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Overview of Measures to Enhance Hong Kong's Competitiveness as an International Financial Centre in 2024\n\nDeepen the connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland China's financial markets, consolidate Hong Kong's status as a hub for offshore renminbi business, and strengthen links within the Greater Bay Area.\n\n- Optimize the \"Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound Swap Connect\"\n- Expand the eligible collateral scope of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's RMB liquidity funding arrangements and the \"Northbound Swap Connect\" to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks\n- Optimize the primary liquidity provider arrangements\n- Enhance the nighttime cross-border service capabilities of Hong Kong's RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement system to better meet the global demand for cross-border RMB payments\n- Provide support for the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government in issuing dim sum bonds in Hong Kong\n- Facilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-border credit information interoperability cooperation\n- Implement cross-border remittance facilitation measures for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area\n- Deepen engagement and communication between relevant mainland institutions and Hong Kong's financial sector to explore business opportunities\n\n# Strengthening Links with Global Communities\n\nHold a series of international events: the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the plenary meeting of the Financial Stability Council, and a seminar co-hosted with the Bank for International Settlements  \nStrengthen market expansion efforts by promoting Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, and lay a solid foundation for cooperation with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region  \nActively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations\n\n# Enhance Financial Platform Competitiveness\n\nThrough the Evergreen project, the initiative has driven innovation in the bond market, including assisting the government in issuing the world's first multi-currency digital bonds, launching a one-stop digital bond knowledge repository called \"EvergreenHub,\" and introducing the \"Digital Bond Funding Scheme.\"\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"and also launching\" is slightly redundant and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is clear and uses appropriate terms. However, the use of \"promote innovation in the bond market\" is slightly less dynamic than \"drive innovation in the bond market.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"first batch\" is slightly less precise than \"first\" in the context of the original text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate, but \"grant\" is not the best fit for \"資助\" in this context. \"Funding\" is more appropriate. Also, the use of \"promoting\" instead of \"promote\" is grammatically incorrect in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"supporting\" for \"協助\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation has several grammatical errors, including \"launched\" instead of \"launching\" and \"kick-off\" used incorrectly. The structure is also awkward and less fluent.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the natural flow of the English language while accurately reflecting the original Chinese text. The final translation should use \"drive\" for \"推動,\" \"one-stop\" for \"一站式,\" \"assist\" for \"協助,\" \"bonds\" for \"債券,\" \"funding\" for \"資助,\" \"launch\" for \"推出,\" and \"Scheme\" for \"計劃.\" It should also ensure that the structure is clear and the meaning is accurately conveyed.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1

markets performed generally well in 2024. Major economies recorded stable growth, while inflation retreated to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks successively lowered policy interest rates, which was favorable for the investment environment. For the whole year of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$218.8 billion in investment income, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar, and may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of such delegation granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"formulates\" and \"investment objectives.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"for the Exchange Fund\" is slightly redundant, as the subject is already the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** \"基金\" is translated as \"Fund,\" which is acceptable. \"為\" is translated as \"for,\" which is one of the valid options. \"制定\" is translated as \"formulates,\" which is appropriate. \"諮詢委員會\" is translated as \"Advisory Committee,\" which is correct. \"投資目標\" is translated as \"investment objectives,\" which is accurate.\n2. **Translation 2:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 1.**  \n   - **Note:** This is a duplicate of Translation 1.\n3. **Translation 3:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is to formulate the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"is to formulate\" is grammatically correct and conveys a formal tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more formal than necessary for the context.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n4. **Translation 4:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has formulated the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"has formulated\" is grammatically correct and implies that the action has already been completed.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The original sentence does not specify whether the formulation is completed or ongoing, so this may be an over-interpretation.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n5. **Translation 5:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 1.**  \n   - **Note:** This is a duplicate of Translation 1.\n6. **Translation 6:**  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee on the Exchange Fund formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** The phrase \"Advisory Committee on the Exchange Fund\" is a slightly different phrasing but still accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"on the Exchange Fund\" is less common than \"of the Exchange Fund\" in this context.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe most accurate and natural translation would use \"formulates\" for \"制定\" and \"investment objectives\" for \"投資目標.\" The phrase \"for the Exchange Fund\" is slightly redundant, but it is not incorrect. However, the phrase \"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is more concise and commonly used than \"The Advisory Committee on the Exchange Fund.\"\nThe use of \"formulates\" is appropriate as it conveys the idea of creating or establishing something formal, which aligns with the context of setting investment objectives.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Safeguard capital;  \n(ii) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;  \n(iii) Ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(iv) Strive to maximize investment returns, subject to compliance with the aforementioned (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a policy or financial document. The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"statutory purpose\" for \"法定目的\" and \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\"\n- The phrase \"have already been reflected in\" is consistently used for \"並已反映,\" which is accurate.\n- \"Portfolio structure\" and \"target asset allocation\" are correctly translated for \"組合架構\" and \"目標資產配置,\" respectively.\n- The use of \"Figure 1\" is consistent across most translations, which is appropriate for \"圖示1.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, third, and fifth translations use \"objectives\" for \"目標,\" which is acceptable but slightly generic. \"Goals\" or \"targets\" might be more precise depending on context.\n- The fourth translation uses \"Mapping 1\" instead of \"Figure 1,\" which is incorrect based on the dictionary entry for \"圖\" (which includes \"Figure\").\n- The third translation uses \"comprehensively take into account,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and less common in formal financial writing.\n- The first and second translations use \"fully address\" and \"fully consider,\" which are both acceptable but \"take into account\" is more precise for \"顧及.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"take into account\" for \"顧及\" to maintain the nuance of considering or incorporating something.\n- Use \"objectives\" for \"目標\" as it is the most neutral and commonly used term in formal contexts.\n- Ensure \"Figure 1\" is used consistently for \"圖示1.\"\n- Maintain a formal and concise tone, avoiding overly verbose phrasing.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe above objectives fully take into account the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text, \"圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別,\" is a title that should be concise and precise. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Figure 1: Categories of Investment Portfolios of the Exchange Fund\" – This is grammatically correct and uses \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary. However, \"Investment Portfolios\" is plural, which may not match the singular \"類別\" (category) in the original.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Figure 1 Investment Portfolio Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund\" – This is fluent but uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not the most direct translation from the dictionary. Also, the lack of a colon after \"Figure 1\" may be less formal.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Chart 1 illustrates the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio categories.\" – This is a full sentence rather than a title, which is inappropriate for a heading. It also uses \"Chart\" instead of \"Figure\" or \"Mapping,\" which may not align with the intended visual representation.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Figure 1: Investment Portfolio Category of the Foreign Exchange Fund\" – This uses \"Category\" in singular, which may not match the plural \"類別\" in the original. Also, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is not the most direct translation from the dictionary.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Figure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund’s Portfolio\" – This is concise and uses \"Exchange Fund\" correctly. However, \"Portfolio\" is singular, which may not fully capture the nuance of \"投資組合\" (investment portfolio), which is more naturally plural in context.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Figure 1 Categories of the Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\" – This is concise and grammatically correct. It uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Investment Portfolio\" appropriately, and the structure mirrors the original title well.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should also reflect the original structure as a title. Based on the above analysis, the most accurate and natural translation is:\n**Figure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio** – This version uses \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary, \"Investment Portfolio\" to match \"投資組合,\" and \"Categories\" to reflect \"類別.\" It is concise, grammatically correct, and maintains the structure of the original title.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the regulations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has adopted a prudent and incremental approach to allocate part of the Exchange Fund's assets to more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation for the long-term growth portfolio, along with the allocation of other asset classes, is formulated in accordance with prudential risk management principles and a diversified asset allocation strategy.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which the Government purchased for strategic purposes for the Exchange Fund. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe original text discusses the operations of the Exchange Fund and the Future Fund, focusing on deposit acceptance, interest rate mechanisms, and asset allocation targets. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Exchange Fund\" correctly, accurately translates \"法定組織\" as \"statutory organisations,\" and correctly uses \"approximately 35:65\" with \"about.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Future Fund\" inconsistently (e.g., \"future fund\" vs. \"Future Fund\"), and \"primary example\" is slightly vague.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Mostly correct, though \"future\" is used as \"future\" rather than \"Future Fund\" in one instance.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, and \"major exception\" is a strong phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"was approximately 35:65\" instead of \"is approximately 35:65,\" which may mislead about the current status.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct, but \"was\" may not align with the original text's present tense.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"foreign exchange reserves\" instead of \"fiscal reserves,\" which may be more accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"in the future\" redundantly, and \"primary example in the future\" is awkward.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** \"foreign exchange\" is not in the dictionary, so it's a deviation.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"major individual example\" and \"determined by actual asset allocation\" accurately.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"was approximately 35:65\" again, and \"major individual example\" is slightly awkward.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct, but \"was\" may not match the original's present tense.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"policy rates\" and \"asset mix\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Reserves\" and \"Fund\" with capitalization inconsistently, and \"about\" is used instead of \"approximately.\"  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Mostly correct, but \"Reserves\" and \"Fund\" should be lowercase unless proper nouns.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"from time to time\" for \"不時\" and \"target asset allocation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"accounted for about 35:65\" instead of \"target asset allocation is approximately 35:65,\" which is less precise.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct, but \"accounted for\" is not the best fit for \"目標資產配置.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Use \"Future Fund\" as a proper noun.\n- Use \"approximately\" for \"約.\"\n- Use \"statutory organisations\" for \"法定組織.\"\n- Use \"target asset allocation\" for \"目標資產配置.\"\n- Use \"interest rate\" or \"policy rates\" for \"利率.\"\n- Use \"investment portfolio\" and \"long-term growth portfolio\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use present tense for current facts and \"in 2024\" for the specific year.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organisations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major individual example, where the interest rates on deposits are linked to the returns of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with rates determined by the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio in the Future Fund is approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe original text discusses the investment procedures of the Exchange Fund, focusing on strategic and tactical asset allocation, benchmarking, and the concept of \"strategic deviation.\" The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"strategic asset allocation\" twice, which is incorrect since the original text distinguishes between \"策略性資產配置\" and \"戰略性資產配置.\" It also uses \"strategic deviation\" incorrectly, as the term should be \"tactical deviation\" based on the dictionary. The translation is somewhat fluent but has several inaccuracies.\n2. **Second Translation:** Correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation. It also uses \"tactical deviation\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"short-term market changing\" instead of \"short-term market changes,\" which is less natural.\n3. **Third Translation:** Accurately distinguishes between \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation. It uses \"tactical deviation\" and \"short-term market changes,\" which are natural and correct. The only minor issue is the use of \"formulates\" for \"制定,\" which is acceptable but \"determines\" might be more precise.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" correctly. It uses \"strategic deviation\" incorrectly and \"tactical asset allocation\" for the term that should be \"strategic asset allocation\" in the sentence about the Monetary Authority. The translation is fluent but has some inaccuracies.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Repeats \"strategic asset allocation\" twice, which is incorrect. It also uses \"strategic deviation\" incorrectly. The translation is otherwise fluent but has significant errors in terminology.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Correctly distinguishes between \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation. It uses \"tactical deviation\" and \"short-term market changes.\" However, it incorrectly assigns \"tactical asset allocation\" to the Monetary Authority's role, which should be \"strategic asset allocation.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly distinguish between \"策略性\" (strategic) and \"戰略性\" (tactical).\n- Use \"tactical deviation\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"strategic asset allocation\" for the role of the Monetary Authority.\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"short-term market changes.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based separately on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the form of an investment benchmark, which refers to the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline, through tactical asset allocation, to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark configuration (i.e., strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark configurations is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the allowable range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Direct Investment\nThe original text is a single term, \"直接投資,\" which translates to \"Direct Investment.\" The dictionary provides several options for \"投資,\" including \"investment,\" \"investors,\" \"investments,\" \"invest,\" \"investing,\" and \"investment-related.\" In this context, \"Direct Investment\" is the most appropriate and standard translation, as it is a commonly used term in finance and economics.\nAll junior translators have correctly identified \"Direct Investment\" as the translation, with minor variations in formatting (e.g., the use of a hashtag or lack thereof). However, the most natural and standard translation would be \"Direct Investment\" without additional formatting, as it is a standalone term and does not require a hashtag or other symbols for clarity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"Exchange Fund Investment Office\" (EFIO) as the official name, using either the full name or the acronym.\n- The term \"70%\" is consistently translated as \"approximately 70%\" or \"about 70%,\" which aligns with the dictionary's \"about\" or \"around.\"\n- The term \"fixed-income\" is correctly used for \"定息.\"\n- The term \"macro risk management strategy\" is accurately translated from \"宏觀風險管理策略.\"\n- The use of \"derivative instruments\" or \"derivative tools\" is appropriate for \"衍生工具.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"support portfolio\" or \"supporting portfolio\" for \"支持組合,\" which is not the best fit. The dictionary lists \"support\" as an option, but \"supporting\" or \"supported\" may not be the most natural in this context. A better choice would be \"supported portfolio\" or \"support portfolio.\"\n- The term \"portfolio\" is inconsistently capitalized in some translations, which may be confusing.\n- Some translations use \"functions\" with a capital \"F\" when it should be lowercase unless referring to a specific title.\n- The phrase \"executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies\" is grammatically correct but could be more fluidly phrased as \"execute the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies.\"\n- Some translations use \"investment portfolios\" instead of \"investment portfolio\" when the singular is more appropriate.\n- The term \"office\" is sometimes used without the necessary context, such as \"office staff\" instead of \"staff of the office.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"supported portfolio\" for \"支持組合\" to align with the dictionary and provide clarity.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of terms like \"portfolio\" and \"functions.\"\n- Use the singular \"portfolio\" where appropriate.\n- Use \"execute\" instead of \"executes\" for grammatical consistency.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most natural and contextually appropriate English alternatives.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supported portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This internally managed portion of the portfolio includes global fixed-income market investments, and through various derivative instruments, executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to draw on the market insights and specialized investment knowledge of the external investment managers.\n\nExpenses related to hiring an external investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making robust risk management even more important. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for all investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance regime. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to carry out effective risk management and governance. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly monitors major categories of investment risks (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks), and has established risk management procedures to provide a resilient framework for strategic planning and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and translate key terms such as \"ESG,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"responsible investment,\" and \"risk-adjusted long-term returns.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"guiding principles\" and \"prioritized\" is well handled in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is inconsistent. The dictionary lists \"HKMA\" as an acceptable term, so it should be used consistently.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** The sixth translation uses \"moderately emphasizing\" instead of \"appropriately emphasizing,\" which is not in line with the dictionary entry for \"適度\" (which should be translated as \"appropriately\" or \"moderately\" depending on context). However, \"appropriately\" is more natural in this context.\n- **Dictionary Compliance:** The sixth translation uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA\" in some places, which is not ideal for consistency. Also, \"four years\" is not used in any translation, though it is in the dictionary; however, \"2024\" is used, which is correct.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** The first and sixth translations use quotation marks correctly around the chapter title, while others use different formats or omit them.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"appropriately\" for \"適度\" as it is more natural in this context.\n- Ensure that \"2024 Sustainable Development Report\" is used with the correct title formatting.\n- Maintain consistent use of quotation marks around the chapter title.\n- Ensure that \"risk-adjusted long-term returns\" is used consistently, as it is a standard term in finance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund's investment objectives and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related risks associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund. Its guiding principle is that ESG investments will generally be prioritized when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment projects. For details on the HKMA's work on responsible investment, see Chapter \"Responsible Investment\" of the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# 2024 Financial Markets\n\nIn 2024, the global financial markets generally performed well.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"美國\" as \"the US\" or \"United States,\" \"人工智能\" as \"Artificial Intelligence,\" and \"內地\" as \"Mainland.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"stock markets,\" \"investors,\" \"confidence,\" and \"policy measures.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the backdrop of the artificial intelligence热潮\" (with \"热潮\" left in Chinese), which should be translated as \"Artificial Intelligence boom\" or \"Artificial Intelligence trend.\"\n- The use of \"the Central\" instead of \"the central government\" is grammatically incorrect and should be corrected.\n- Some translations use \"Mainland and Hong Kong\" without specifying \"stock markets,\" which can lead to ambiguity.\n- The phrase \"the market believes that with the growth of the real economy still unclear\" is awkward and should be rephrased for clarity and fluency.\n- Some translations use \"softened\" or \"moderated\" for \"回軟,\" which is appropriate, but the context should be more clearly conveyed.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should maintain the original structure while ensuring clarity, fluency, and grammatical correctness.\n- It should use the most natural English equivalents for the dictionary terms, such as \"the US\" for \"美國\" and \"Mainland\" for \"內地.\"\n- The phrase \"the backdrop of the artificial intelligence热潮\" should be fully translated as \"the backdrop of the Artificial Intelligence boom.\"\n- The phrase \"the market believes that with the growth of the real economy still unclear\" should be rephrased to \"given the uncertainty surrounding real economic growth.\"\n- The use of \"the central government\" should be consistent and grammatically correct.\n**Improved Translation:**\nMain stock markets experienced significant gains in 2024, with the US stock market showing particularly strong performance in the first three quarters amid generally improved economic and inflation conditions and the backdrop of the Artificial Intelligence boom. However, market conditions became volatile in the fourth quarter due to concerns over rising inflation and increasing bond yields, leading to a retreat from their highs, and investors also turned more cautious. Regarding the Mainland and Hong Kong stock markets, investor confidence improved as they benefited from a range of policy measures introduced by the central government in the third quarter to stimulate the economy and stock markets. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty surrounding real economic growth, stock markets in both regions softened in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe global bond market also experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although major central banks generally established the direction of rate cuts, the pace and extent of rate cuts underwent multiple changes throughout the year. By the fourth quarter, markets began to focus on the U.S. fiscal policy in 2025, with U.S. Treasury yields rising substantially during the quarter, putting downward pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to interest rate trends and the relatively strong performance of the US economy.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2024.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe original text states that the \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund) recorded \"2,188億港元\" (2,188 billion Hong Kong dollars) in investment income in 2024, \"其中包括\" (including). The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly used appropriate equivalents.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, including:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"HK$218.8 billion\" and \"including.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"2,188億\" as \"218.8 billion\" instead of \"2,188 billion.\" This is a critical numerical error.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded HK$218.8 billion in investment income in 2024, including:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as above, with correct structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same numerical error as the first translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$2,188 billion in 2024, including:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"2,188 billion\" and \"including.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"HK$2,188 billion\" which is technically correct but less common in formal financial reporting.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, including:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct structure and use of \"including.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same numerical error as the first two translations.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of 2,188 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2024, including:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct numerical value and use of \"including.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Hong Kong dollars\" instead of the more concise \"HK$\" which is standard in financial contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"The Exchange Fund recorded HK$2,188 billion in investment income in 2024, which includes:\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct numerical value and use of \"HK$.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"which includes\" instead of \"including,\" which is slightly less direct and slightly less common in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct numerical value: **2,188 billion** (not 218.8 billion).\n- Use the standard financial abbreviation: **HK$** (not \"Hong Kong dollars\").\n- Use the most direct and common phrasing: **\"including\"** (not \"which includes\").\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in formal financial reporting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$2,188 billion in 2024, including:\n\n- Bond investment gains: 135.9 billion Hong Kong dollars;  \n- Stock investment gains: 90.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (of which 21.8 billion Hong Kong dollars from Hong Kong stock investments, and 69.1 billion Hong Kong dollars from investments in other stocks);  \n- A downward adjustment of 35.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the foreign exchange valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets; and  \n- Other investment gains held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund Investment Holdings: 27.6 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation gains of 28 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the Exchange Fund's total assets reached HK$408.1 billion. The total market value of the long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$54.12 billion, of which private equity amounted to HK$43.48 billion and real estate amounted to HK$10.64 billion. The total amount of exposure already incurred but not yet drawn down for investment in the long-term growth portfolio was HK$28.86 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is grammatically sound and uses \"since its inception\" correctly for \"投資以\". However, \"rate of return on investment\" is slightly redundant, as \"rate of return\" already implies investment.\n2. **Translation 2** is fluent and concise. It uses \"annualized\" correctly and avoids redundancy. However, \"has achieved\" may not be the most neutral tone for a factual statement.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"Support\" with a capital \"S\" which may be inappropriate unless it refers to a specific entity. It also uses \"achieved\" similarly to Translation 2.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"since the commencement of investment\" instead of \"since its inception,\" which is less idiomatic and slightly less precise than the dictionary's suggested \"since its inception.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 2, with the only difference being the use of \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" with capitalization, which may be appropriate if it refers to a specific portfolio.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best options but uses \"is\" for the long-term growth portfolio's return, which may be less appropriate than \"has been\" or \"was\" depending on the context.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary, with \"Fund\" capitalized if it refers to a specific entity.\n- Use \"excluding the strategic asset portfolio\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"rate of return\" without redundancy.\n- Use \"since its inception\" for \"投資以.\"\n- Use \"annualised\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"support portfolio\" with lowercase unless it refers to a specific entity.\n- Use \"has achieved\" or \"was\" for the long-term growth portfolio's return, depending on whether the statement is about a past period or ongoing performance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) had a rate of return of 5.2% in 2024, with the portfolio's rate of return at 7.2% and the support portfolio at 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio's annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 was 11.2%.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 shows the investment rate of return of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment rate of return for different periods. The average rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 2022 to 2024 was 2.0%, from 2020 to 2024 was 3.1%, from 2015 to 2024 was 3.1%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.5%. Table 3 sets out the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2024. For further details, see the audited 2024 annual financial statements of the Exchange Fund on pages 203 to 309.\n\nFigure 1 Exchange Fund Investment Rate of Return (1994 to 2024)\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Rate of Return (1994 to 2024)\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Rate of Return (1994 to 2024)\nChart 1: Exchange Fund investment rate of return (1994 to 2024).\nFigure 1 Exchange Fund Investment Rate of Return (1994 to 2024)\nFigure 1 Exchange Fund investment rate of return (1994 to 2024 year)\nReview and Reasoning:\nAll translations are very close to each other and correctly use the dictionary terms. The term \"圖\" is translated as \"Figure\" or \"Chart,\" both of which are acceptable, though \"Figure\" is more commonly used in academic or financial contexts. The term \"基金\" is translated as \"Fund\" or \"Exchange Fund,\" which is appropriate given the context of the \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund). The term \"回報率\" is consistently translated as \"Rate of Return,\" which is accurate.\nHowever, there are minor issues with punctuation and capitalization. For instance, the first junior translator and the second use a colon after \"Figure 1,\" which is standard in English for titles. The third and fifth translators omit the colon, which is less formal but still acceptable. The fourth translator uses \"Chart\" instead of \"Figure,\" which is a valid alternative but less common in this context. The sixth translator uses \"year\" at the end of the time range, which is redundant since \"2024\" already implies a year.\nThe best translation would use \"Figure\" as it is the most standard term for such headings in formal contexts. It should also include a colon after the figure number for clarity and consistency. The phrase \"investment rate of return\" should be capitalized consistently, as it is a title. The time range should be written as \"(1994 to 2024)\" without the redundant \"year.\"\nBased on these considerations, the most refined translation would be:\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Rate of Return (1994 to 2024)\n"}

資訊中心\n\n金管局資訊中心設於國際金融中心2期55樓，分為展覽館及圖書館兩部分，旨在向公眾介紹金管局的工作，並提高公眾對貨幣與銀行業事宜的認識。展覽館以互動方式簡介金管局的工作，以及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展；另備資料與展品，供研究香港貨幣、銀行業與金融事務。\n\n年內資訊中心接待超過68,000名訪客，較2023年增加約120%。資訊中心亦為學校及其他團體提供570多次導賞服務。\n\n毗鄰展覽館的圖書館收藏超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，涵蓋香港貨幣、銀行業、金融和中央銀行事務等課題。圖書館亦備存《銀行業條例》第20條規定的「認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊」及「認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊」，供公眾查閱。\n\n幼稚園生參加資訊中心導賞，認識有關香港鈔票的設計\n\n資訊中心人員向訪客介紹以香港硬幣砌出維港景色的馬賽克作品\n\n# 社區聯繫及公眾教育\n\n為增進市民對金管局工作的認識，金管局自1998年起推出公眾教育講座，至今錄得參加者人數超過68,000名。於2024年，我們舉行網上講座，吸引800多名來自41間中學的師生參加。講座內容涵蓋金管局工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、防騙、存款保障計劃、綠色金融及銀行業發展機遇。\n\n我們使用不同渠道聯繫及教育公眾，提醒他們如何做個精明及負責任的金融服務消費者。2024年的活動合共吸引超過67,000名市民參與。\n\n為配合數碼支付及綠色生活的趨勢，我們透過社交媒體及電台宣傳，鼓勵市民於農曆新年期間派發電子利是，亦可考慮以「迎新鈔」派發實體利是。\n\n製作動畫短片鼓勵派發電子利是\n\n# 防騙歌曲 — 《Link咪亂撳》\n\n為進一步加強防騙工作，我們推出由歌手尹光先生與金管局副總裁阮國恒先生合唱的防騙歌曲，提醒市民「假Link咪當真，唔好俾人昆」，以及要妥善保管敏感的個人資料與信用卡資料。跨媒體宣傳活動的成效得到肯定，取得國際推廣殊榮。\n\n副總裁阮國恒先生（右）參與演繹防騙歌曲\n\n跨媒體宣傳活動加強公眾防騙意識\n\n# 《跨境理財新機遇》電視短片系列\n\n金管局與一間本地電視台聯合製作《跨境理財新機遇》電視短片系列，協助市民進一步了解「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）為零售投資者在跨境投資上帶來的機遇及便利。這短片系列藉五部膾炙人口的港產電影的「經典場面」，解說「跨境理財通」的框架、投資者的資格要求、「北向通」與「南向通」提供的產品、風險管理，以及跨境投資應注意的事項，並透過電視、數碼及社交媒體平台進行推廣。\n\n短片以風趣幽默的方式介紹「跨境理財通」\n\n# 全港理財爭霸戰\n\n為提高中學生的理財知識，金管局與多個相關機構合作舉辦「全港理財爭霸戰」。該活動在2024年踏入十周年，主題為「未來金融人才」，旨在讓中學生及早認識創新、金融科技、人工智能等發展及未來動向，以及推動學生秉持可持續發展與環境、社會及管治原則。\n\n爭霸戰第一部分是網上問答比賽，測試參賽學生的理財知識及對熱門金融課題的認識。於2024年，來自290所中學共32,000人次參與網上問答比賽，創下歷年新高。在2015年至2024年間，來自440所中學的學生參與爭霸戰的網上問答比賽環節共約125,000次。爭霸戰的第二部分「少年金融人才計劃」以師友形式進行，由不同範疇的資深從業員擔任導師，培訓學生準備參與「設計思維挑戰賽」。在2024年，這部分的爭霸戰更特別增設「大灣區邀請賽」，以促進粵港澳三地學生互動交流。\n\n副總裁陳維民先生在爭霸戰總決賽致歡迎辭，並為總決賽參賽者打氣\n\n參與「少年金融人才計劃」的學生與導師會面\n\n# 桌上教育遊戲\n\n金管局在2023年推出其首個理財教育桌上遊戲《$mart理財321》，並於2024年繼續推廣，讓更多人認識這副原創桌遊，並加強其作為教育工具的用途，讓小學生在模擬情景下認識不同的支付方法、基本理財概念、金融科技及網絡安全。\n\n在社區層面，我們於「香港書展2024」設置攤位，並在聖誕節及農曆新年期間於社區舉辧工作坊，以及在金管局辦事處舉辦親子工作坊，進一步推廣金融及理財概念。此外，我們亦安排到校活動讓小學生試玩，並舉辦培訓工作坊，鼓勵中學教師在新設初中科目「公民、經濟與社會」的理財教育單元中使用桌遊作為教材之一。桌遊得到教育局肯定為出色的教學工具之一，並用作其舉辦的「理財教育學校獎勵計劃」（2023\/24）優勝學校的獎品。金管局在2024年合共舉辧約40場桌遊工作坊，獲得超過3,600名學生、家長、教師及社工參與。\n\n在開發《$mart理財321》桌遊的經驗基礎上，金管局推出策略桌遊《企業綠化大變身》，於「香港書展2024」的攤位作為紀念品送出。這是全港首副向學生傳遞綠色金融知識的桌遊。\n\n此外，我們繼續支持投資者及理財教育委員會的工作，提升香港市民的金融知識及理財能力，並會研究與不同持份者進一步合作，提高社區參與工作的成效。\n\n透過桌遊活動向教師、學童及家長推廣理財教育\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，金管局採納適用於中央銀行運作的國際財務披露標準，包括香港財務報告準則及國際貨幣基金組織的數據公布特殊標準。財務處在獨立審計師及其他會計專業人員協助下，按照香港財務報告準則編製外匯基金財務報表。此外，金管局在《年報》詳細披露及深入分析預算及支出資料（請參閱第193至194頁「預算編製及財務管控」一節）。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some demonstrating a strong grasp of the content and others containing notable errors or awkward phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent, but \"Institutional functions departments\" is awkward and unclear. \"Maintaining high transparency and accountability\" is correct, but \"achieving excellent efficiency\" is slightly off compared to the original's \"發揮卓越的效率\" (unlocking or tapping into excellent efficiency). The use of \"maintains links\" is acceptable but could be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is more concise and natural. \"Institutional functional departments\" is better than \"Institutional functions departments.\" The phrase \"demonstrating excellence in efficiency and professional standards\" is more natural than \"achieving excellent efficiency.\" The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate and consistent.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several issues. \"Institutions, departments, and business units\" is unnecessarily wordy and not directly supported by the original. \"Unlock its excellent efficiency and professional professionalism\" is awkward and grammatically incorrect. \"Overall society\" is not a standard phrase and should be \"broader society\" or \"whole society.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise but has some issues. \"Corporate Functions departments\" is awkward and not a standard term. \"Unlocking excellent efficiency and professional standards\" is better than \"achieving excellent efficiency,\" but \"professional standards\" is slightly less precise than \"professionalism.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. \"Institutional functional departments\" is correct. \"Demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism\" is natural and captures the nuance of \"發揮卓越的效率及專業水準.\" The use of \"maintains contact\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear and consistent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the fifth but uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less specific. Also, \"maintaining links\" is slightly less natural than \"maintaining contact.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- \"Institutional functional departments\" is the most accurate and natural translation of \"機構職能部門.\"\n- \"Maintaining high transparency and accountability\" is correct and natural.\n- \"Demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism\" best captures the nuance of \"發揮卓越的效率及專業水準.\"\n- \"To promote public understanding\" is more natural than \"To promote the public's understanding.\"\n- \"Maintaining contact with the broader society and market participants\" is natural and consistent with the original.\n- The use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more specific and appropriate than \"Monetary Authority.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe institutional functional departments support the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's operations, maintaining high transparency and accountability, and demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policies and work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively maintains contact with the broader society and market participants through traditional and social media, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority website, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority strives to establish a flexible and professional workforce, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing digital capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media Applications\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is well-structured and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and accurately translates terms like \"tokenisation\" and \"SMEs.\" However, it uses \"enhance transparency and improve public understanding\" which is slightly repetitive. It also uses \"day-to-day media queries\" which is acceptable but not the most natural phrasing.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is very similar to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"Mainland China\" instead of \"Mainland,\" which is more precise. It also uses \"approximately\" instead of \"about,\" which is slightly more formal. However, it uses \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\" which is slightly wordy.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation has some issues. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"closely linked operations with media,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic. The term \"Functions\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"etc.\" is used in a way that is not ideal in formal writing.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"on-the-spot interviews\" which is more natural than \"on-site interviews.\" It also uses \"organized\" consistently and correctly. However, it uses \"small and medium enterprises (SMEs)\" which is slightly less formal than \"small and medium-sized enterprises.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is very close to the best versions. It uses \"the public's understanding\" which is slightly more natural than \"public understanding.\" It also uses \"media daily inquiries\" which is slightly awkward but acceptable. It correctly uses \"Mainland\" and \"SMEs.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This is the most polished of the translations. It uses \"released\" instead of \"issued\" for press releases, which is more natural in this context. It also uses \"daily media inquiries\" which is concise and natural. It correctly uses \"Mainland\" and \"SMEs.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and consistent with the dictionary. It should use \"HKMA\" consistently, use \"Mainland\" instead of \"Mainland China,\" and use \"SMEs\" without unnecessary modifiers. It should also use \"day-to-day\" for routine queries and \"issued\" or \"released\" for press releases. The phrase \"enhance transparency and improve public understanding\" is slightly repetitive and could be improved to \"enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close contact with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2024, the HKMA held or participated in a total of 207 activities, including 14 press conferences, four media briefings, 14 on-site interviews, and 175 other public events. To enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s main functions, the HKMA organized press conferences and media briefings for local, Mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as tokenization, anti-fraud measures, and support measures for SMEs. During the year, the HKMA also arranged 25 media interviews, issued approximately 600 bilingual press releases, and handled a large number of day-to-day media inquiries.\n\nChief Executive Mr. Yu Wai-man accepted on-site media interviews at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2024\".\n\nDeputy President Mr. Li Dazhi gave a welcome speech at the \"Account Linkage\" Use Cases Demonstration Day.\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Li Dazhi gave a welcoming speech on the date of the “Account linkage” use cases presentation.\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. LidaZhi's welcome speech on the day of the \"Account Linkage\" use case demonstration\nDeputy Chief Executive Li Dazhi delivered a welcome speech on the day of the \"Account linkage\" use cases demonstration.\nDeputy CEO Mr. Lee Tak Chee delivered a welcome speech at the \"Account Linkage\" Use Cases Demonstration Day.\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Chief Executive, delivered a welcome speech on the day of the \"Account linkage\" use case demonstration.\nThe translations vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary. The first translation correctly uses \"Deputy President\" and \"Use Cases Demonstration Day\" but omits the title \"Chief Executive\" for \"總裁.\" The second translation uses \"Deputy Chief Executive\" correctly but uses \"on the date of\" which is awkward. The third translation has a typo (\"LidaZhi\") and uses \"use case\" instead of \"use cases.\" The fourth translation is fluent and accurate, using \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"use cases.\" The fifth translation uses \"Deputy CEO\" and \"Lee Tak Chee,\" which may not be the correct transliteration of \"李達志.\" The sixth translation is accurate but uses \"use case\" instead of \"use cases.\"\nThe best translation should use \"Deputy Chief Executive\" for \"副總裁,\" \"Account Linkage\" for \"戶口互聯,\" and \"use cases\" for \"用例.\" It should also use the correct transliteration of \"李達志\" as \"Li Dazhi\" and use \"delivered a welcome speech at the\" for fluency.\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Li Dazhi delivered a welcome speech at the \"Account Linkage\" Use Cases Demonstration Day.\n\nMedia representatives actively participated in the activities organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2024, especially the third edition of the \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.\" The summit lasted three days and received over 10,000 news reports from local, Mainland, and international media.\n\nChief Executive Mr. Yu Weiwén accepted a livestreamed interview from the media at the \"2024 Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\"\nChief Executive Mr. Yu Weiwén accepted a livestreamed interview from the media at the \"2024 Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\"\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Ruan Guoheng hosted a media briefing on the establishment of the \"SME Financing Taskforce\".\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Deputy Chief Executive, delivered the opening remarks at the \"2024 Corporate Treasury Market Summit\".\n\nTo more effectively connect with the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) operates six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly known as Twitter), and YouTube), which have attracted over 200,000 followers. The HKMA creates creative social media content to enhance public awareness of a range of topics and initiatives, such as fraud prevention, fintech, green and sustainable finance, support for SMEs, and major events organized by the HKMA. The HKMA also livestreams the \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" on its social media pages, promoting public and industry participation.\n\nPublishing creative content on social media helps increase public awareness of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's measures and various issues.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局的公眾查詢服務為市民提供有效渠道，以增進其對金管局主要職能及運作的認識。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"functions\" and \"operations,\" correct use of \"residents\" for \"市民.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Residents\" is less precise than \"the public\" or \"citizens.\" Also, \"enhance their understanding\" is slightly less natural than \"promote their understanding.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"職能\" → \"functions,\" \"為\" → \"for,\" \"提供\" → \"provides,\" \"公眾\" → \"public,\" \"市民\" → \"residents,\" \"運作\" → \"operations,\" \"服務\" → \"service,\" \"查詢\" → \"inquiry.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"citizens\" for \"市民,\" which is more inclusive than \"residents.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Enhance their understanding\" is slightly less natural than \"promote their understanding.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Similar to the second, but uses \"the Authority\" consistently.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above with \"enhance their understanding.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"users\" for \"市民,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Promote their understanding\" is more natural than \"enhance,\" but \"users\" is less precise than \"the public\" or \"citizens.\" Also, \"queries\" is a good translation for \"查詢.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"facilitate their understanding,\" which is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Public services\" is incorrect; the original refers to \"公眾查詢服務\" (public inquiry service), not \"public services.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"服務\" is translated as \"services\" instead of \"service,\" which is incorrect.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"the public\" for \"市民,\" which is accurate. \"Enhance their understanding\" is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Public inquiry service\" is slightly less precise than \"public queries service\" or \"public inquiry service.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"市民\" should be translated as \"the public\" or \"citizens,\" not \"users.\"\n- \"職能\" should be \"functions\" (capitalized if referring to the Authority's official functions).\n- \"運作\" should be \"operations.\"\n- \"查詢\" should be \"queries\" or \"inquiries.\"\n- \"提供\" should be \"provides\" or \"offers.\"\n- \"為\" should be \"for\" or \"to.\"\n- \"有效渠道\" should be \"an effective channel.\"\n- \"增進其對...認識\" should be \"enhance their understanding of\" or \"promote their understanding of.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's public inquiry service provides the public with an effective channel to enhance their understanding of the Authority's main functions and operations.\n\nIn 2024, the public inquiry service handled a total of 9,594 queries (Figure 1), all of which were replied to within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's service commitment timeframe (Table 1). Approximately half of these queries involved banking consumer matters, financial infrastructure and bond market development, banking sector policies and regulations, as well as banknotes and coins (Figure 2). Common queries included the coin collection scheme, bank products and services, retail bond issuance plans, banking sector-related guidelines and circulars, and \"Faster Payment System.\"\n\nFigure 1 Total Public Queries\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數,\" which translates to \"Figure 1 Total Public Queries\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n1. **Translation 1: \"Figure 1 Public Queries Total\"** – This is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. \"Total\" at the end feels out of place compared to standard English phrasing.\n2. **Translation 2: \"Figure 1 Public queries total\"** – This is similar to the first but uses lowercase \"queries,\" which is inconsistent with title case conventions for headings or captions.\n3. **Translation 3: \"Figure 1: Total Public Queries\"** – This is the most natural and fluent of the options. The colon after \"Figure 1\" is appropriate for labeling, and the placement of \"Total\" before \"Public Queries\" is standard in English.\n4. **Translation 4: \"Figure 1 Public Queries Total Number\"** – This is unnecessarily wordy. \"Total Number\" is redundant when \"Total\" alone suffices.\n5. **Translation 5: \"Figure 1 Total Number of Public Enquiries\"** – While grammatically correct, it is overly verbose and uses \"Enquiries\" instead of \"Queries,\" which is less common in this context.\n6. **Translation 6: \"Cyber Mapping 1 Public enquiries\"** – This incorrectly uses \"Cyber Mapping\" for \"圖\" and omits \"Total,\" making it inaccurate and confusing.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard English phrasing. \"Figure 1: Total Public Queries\" is the most appropriate, as it uses the correct term \"Figure\" for \"圖,\" \"Public Queries\" for \"公眾查詢,\" and places \"Total\" before the noun phrase, which is standard in English. It also uses a colon to separate the label from the title, which is common in captions or headings. The term \"Queries\" is more commonly used in this context than \"Enquiries\" or \"Questions,\" and it aligns with the dictionary options provided.\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2024 by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the \"2023 Annual Report\" and the \"2023 Sustainable Development Report.\" The \"2023 Sustainable Development Report\" received the Judges' Commendation in the \"Public\/Non-Profit Institutions (Large)\" category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants' \"Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2024.\" In addition, the \"2023 Annual Report\" received a Bronze Award in the \"Non-Profit and Charitable Institutions\" category of the Hong Kong Management Association's 2024 Annual Best Annual Report Competition.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly updated the \"Financial Data Monthly Report\" 1 and published:\n\n- Two Issues of the Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability  \n- Four Issues of the Quarterly Report; and  \n- 14 Articles from \"Exchange Insights\".\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability\" and \"Exchange Insights\" for \"《匯思》\". The structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate, but \"Monetary and Financial Stability\" is slightly less precise than \"Currency and Financial Stability\" as per the dictionary. The use of \"Situation\" is not necessary and adds unnecessary complexity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and contains awkward phrasing such as \"Two periods of the Half-Yearly report on Currency and Financial stability situation.\" The use of \"Hui Si\" without translation is incorrect; it should be \"Exchange Insights\" as per the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise but lacks proper capitalization and punctuation. It also omits the title of the report and uses \"Exchange articles\" instead of \"Exchange Insights\" for \"《匯思》\".\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly uses \"Monetary and Financial Stability\" and \"Exchange Thoughts series\" for \"《匯思》\". However, \"Thoughts series\" is not as precise as \"Insights\" in the context of a publication.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and follows the dictionary guidelines. It correctly uses \"Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability\" and \"Exchange\" for \"《匯思》\". However, \"Exchange\" is less descriptive than \"Exchange Insights\".\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》\" should be translated as \"Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability\" to maintain clarity and professionalism.\n- \"《季報》\" should be \"Quarterly Report\" to match the dictionary and maintain consistency.\n- \"《匯思》\" should be translated as \"Exchange Insights\" to reflect the intended meaning and maintain the publication's name in a descriptive manner.\n- The use of \"Issues\" is appropriate for \"期\" in the context of reports.\n- The structure should be parallel and consistent across all items.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\n- Two Issues of the Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability  \n- Four Issues of the Quarterly Report; and  \n- 14 Articles from \"Exchange Insights\".\nTwo Issues of the Half-Yearly Report on Currency and Financial Stability  \nFour Issues of the Quarterly Report; and  \n14 Articles from \"Exchange Insights\".\n\n# Institutional Website\n\nThe HKMA website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 73,000 pages of information in English and in both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The website also includes the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff of Authorized Institutions Engaged in Securities Business,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Facilities,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality, with some demonstrating a good grasp of the content and structure, while others contain notable errors in grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"開放API\" as \"open APIs\" and \"截至\" as \"as at.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent in most translations, which is appropriate for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"paying\" for \"發放,\" which is incorrect. \"發放\" should be translated as \"releasing\" or \"disseminating,\" not \"paying.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"hkma\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the proper noun \"HKMA.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"phased payments\" for \"分階段發放,\" which misinterprets the term. \"分階段\" refers to a phased approach, not payments.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"payment\" for \"發放\" and repeats \"open API\" redundantly.\n- **Translation 5** has grammatical errors, such as \"payment financial data\" and \"See further information is contained related to the hkma’s open API,\" which are awkward and incorrect.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate, using \"progressively releasing\" for \"分階段發放\" and maintaining proper grammar and structure.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"發放\" is translated as \"releasing\" or \"disseminating\" rather than \"payment.\"\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as a proper noun.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"open API\" unnecessarily.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and grammatically correct.\n- Use \"launched\" or \"rolled out\" for \"推出\" and \"data\" or \"information\" for \"資料\" and \"資訊.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strengths of the translations, particularly Translation 6, with corrections to the misused terms and grammatical errors.\n**Improved Translation:**\nSince 2018, the HKMA has been progressively releasing financial data and important information published on its website through open application programming interfaces (open APIs) in phases. As at the end of 2024, we have launched a total of 177 open APIs on the website according to the original plan. For more detailed information on the HKMA's open APIs, please visit the HKMA Open API Gateway (https:\/\/apidocs.hkma.gov.hk).\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre as being on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations dividing the Centre into an exhibition area and a library.\n- The purpose of the Centre is accurately conveyed in all translations, with the use of terms like \"aims to,\" \"enhance understanding,\" and \"introduce the work of the HKMA.\"\n- The use of \"interactive\" to describe the exhibition area is consistent across translations, which is appropriate given the context.\n- The translations all correctly identify the Centre's role in providing data and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The dictionary lists \"HKMA\" as an acceptable translation, but for consistency, it should be used uniformly.\n- **\"Phase 2\" vs. \"2\":** Some translations use \"Phase 2,\" while others use \"2.\" The dictionary includes \"2\" as an acceptable translation, but \"Phase 2\" is more natural in English when referring to a building.\n- **\"Matters\" vs. \"Issues\":** The dictionary lists both \"matters\" and \"issues\" as acceptable translations for \"事宜.\" However, \"matters\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- **\"Financial Affairs\" vs. \"Financial Matters\":** Some translations use \"financial affairs,\" while others use \"financial matters.\" Both are acceptable, but \"financial matters\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **\"Study\" vs. \"Research\":** The dictionary includes \"study\" and \"research\" as acceptable translations for \"研究.\" However, \"study\" is more general and appropriate in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Use \"Phase 2\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Use \"matters\" for \"事宜.\"\n- Use \"study\" for \"研究.\"\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are translated using the most appropriate and natural English equivalents.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2, and is divided into two parts: an exhibition area and a library. It aims to introduce the work of the HKMA to the public and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking sector matters. The exhibition area provides an interactive introduction to the HKMA's work, as well as the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector; it also provides data and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial matters.\n\nThe original text provides factual information about the number of visitors to an Information Centre and the number of guided tours it provided. The translations by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are some minor issues in fluency, word choice, and consistency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Information Centre\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"more than\" is appropriately used for \"超過.\"\n- The percentage increase is consistently translated as \"about 120%.\"\n- The phrase \"guided tour services\" is used in several translations, which is accurate and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, third, and fourth translations use \"during the year\" or \"within the year,\" which are both acceptable, but \"during the year\" is more commonly used in formal writing.\n- The fifth translation uses \"provides the school and other groups with over 570 tours,\" which is slightly awkward and less precise than \"provided over 570 guided tour services to schools and other groups.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"provides\" in the second sentence, which is grammatically correct but inconsistent with the past tense used in the first sentence. The original text uses \"接待\" and \"提供,\" which are past tense actions, so the translation should reflect that.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"during the year\" for consistency and fluency.\n- Ensure consistent tense usage (past tense for both sentences).\n- Use \"provided over 570 guided tour services to schools and other groups\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Information Centre received more than 68,000 visitors during the year, an increase of about 120% compared to 2023. The Information Centre also provided over 570 guided tour services to schools and other groups.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition area holds more than 26,000 books, journals, and other publications, covering topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions,\" as required by Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, for public access.\n\nKindergarteners participate in a guided tour of the Information Centre to learn about the design of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nInformation Centre staff introduced visitors to a mosaic artwork made of Hong Kong coins depicting the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\n# Community Links and Public Education\nThe original title, \"# 社區聯繫及公眾教育,\" contains several key terms that must be translated according to the provided dictionary. The term \"聯繫\" (contact\/links) has several possible translations, including \"links,\" \"linkages,\" \"contact,\" and \"engagement.\" The term \"公眾\" (public) can be translated as \"public\" or \"Public.\" The term \"教育\" (education) can be translated as \"education,\" \"educational,\" or \"instruction.\" The term \"社區\" (community) is not in the dictionary, so it should be translated as \"community.\" The term \"區\" (area\/region) is also not in the dictionary, but since it is part of \"社區\" (community), it is not necessary to translate it separately.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in their use of these terms. The first and second translations use \"Community engagement and public education,\" which is a natural and fluent translation. However, \"engagement\" is not one of the possible translations for \"聯繫\" in the dictionary. The third translation uses \"Community linkages and public education,\" which is a more accurate translation of \"聯繫\" but may not be as natural or commonly used as \"engagement.\" The fourth and fifth translations use \"Community Linkages and Public Education\" and \"Community Engagement and Public Education,\" respectively, which are both natural and fluent translations. The sixth translation uses \"Community Links and Public Education,\" which is also a natural and fluent translation.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Community Engagement and Public Education,\" as it is a natural and fluent translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the original title. It uses \"engagement\" for \"聯繫,\" which is not one of the possible translations for \"聯繫\" in the dictionary, but it is a commonly used term in this context. It uses \"public\" for \"公眾,\" which is one of the possible translations for \"公眾\" in the dictionary. It uses \"education\" for \"教育,\" which is one of the possible translations for \"教育\" in the dictionary. It does not use any of the other possible translations for \"聯繫,\" \"公眾,\" or \"教育\" in the dictionary, but it is a natural and fluent translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the original title.\n\nTo enhance the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been conducting public education seminars since 1998, and to date, more than 68,000 participants have attended. In 2024, we held an online seminar, attracting more than 800 students and teachers from 41 secondary schools. The seminar content covered an overview of the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, fraud prevention, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and opportunities in the development of the banking sector.\n\nWe use various channels to contact and educate the public, reminding them how to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers. The 2024 activities attracted more than 67,000 residents to participate.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality translation, each of the junior translators' efforts must be critically assessed. \n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"during the year\" for \"期間\" and \"Payment\" for \"支付,\" which are not the most natural choices. It also misinterprets \"迎新鈔\" as \"new welcome banknote,\" which is awkward and unclear.\n- **Translation 2** is the most accurate and fluent, correctly using \"Lunar New Year period\" for \"期間\" and \"Welcome New Year\" for \"迎新鈔.\" It also uses \"encouraging the public\" for \"鼓勵市民,\" which is natural.\n- **Translation 3** misuses \"new money\" for \"迎新鈔,\" which lacks the cultural nuance of a \"Welcome New Year\" note. It also uses \"They may also consider,\" which is less direct than \"may also consider.\"\n- **Translation 4** is concise and accurate, using \"e-red envelopes\" and \"new year banknotes\" for \"發電子利是\" and \"迎新鈔,\" respectively. However, it omits \"市民\" (the public) in the first part, which is important for clarity.\n- **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 2, with the only difference being the use of \"facilitate\" for \"配合,\" which is less common in this context than \"adapt to.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"New Year cash\" for \"迎新鈔,\" which is less culturally appropriate than \"Welcome New Year notes.\" It also uses \"In order to adapt\" for \"為配合,\" which is correct but slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Lunar New Year period\" for \"期間\" to reflect the specific time frame.\n- Use \"Welcome New Year notes\" for \"迎新鈔\" to preserve the cultural context.\n- Use \"the public\" for \"市民\" to maintain clarity.\n- Use \"adapt to\" for \"為配合\" as it is the most natural and commonly used phrase in this context.\n- Ensure that \"發電子利是\" is translated as \"distribute electronic red envelopes\" to maintain the intended meaning.\n- Ensure that \"電台\" is translated as \"radio stations\" rather than \"telephone.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo adapt to the trend of digital payments and green living, we promote through social media and radio stations, encouraging the public to distribute electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year period, and may also consider distributing physical red envelopes with \"Welcome New Year\" notes.\n\nCreate animated short films to encourage the distribution of e-red envelopes.\n\n# Anti-Scam Song — \"Don't Tap Links Randomly\"\n\nTo further strengthen anti-fraud efforts, we launched an anti-fraud song performed by singer Mr. Yin Guang and Mr.阮國恒, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, reminding the public \"Fake links aren't real, don't let people deceive you,\" and emphasizing the need to properly safeguard sensitive personal data and credit card information. The effectiveness of the cross-media promotional campaign has been recognized, earning it international promotion awards.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr.阮國恒 (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original text is: \"副總裁阮國恒先生（右）參與演繹防騙歌曲\"\nThe dictionary provides specific translations for certain terms:\n- \"國\" should be translated as \"country\" or \"countries\"\n- \"參與\" has multiple options, but the most natural in this context is \"participated\"\n- \"右\" is context-specific and should be translated as \"right (context: Mr Zheng Chiping (right),...)\"\n- \"副\" is \"Deputy\"\n- \"總裁\" is \"Chief Executive\"\nNow, evaluating the junior translations:\n1. **Translation 1**: \"Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Guo Heng (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"participated.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Guo Heng\" is a phonetic translation of \"阮國恒,\" but the surname \"阮\" should be transliterated as \"Nguyen\" or \"阮\" in English contexts, not \"Guo.\"\n   - \"Right\" is correctly used in parentheses.\n2. **Translation 2**: \"Deputy Chief Executive Nguyen Quoc Heng (right) participated in performing the anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"participated.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Quoc Heng\" is a phonetic translation of \"國恒,\" but \"阮\" is a Vietnamese surname, so \"Nguyen\" is appropriate. However, \"Quoc Heng\" is not the standard transliteration of \"國恒.\" The correct transliteration would be \"Quoc Heng\" for \"國恒,\" but the name should be \"Nguyen Quoc Heng.\"\n3. **Translation 3**: \"Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Ng Kwan Hang participated in the performance of the anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Deputy Chief Executive.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Ng Kwan Hang\" is not a standard transliteration of \"阮國恒.\" \"阮\" is \"Nguyen,\" not \"Ng,\" and \"國恒\" should be \"Quoc Heng.\"\n4. **Translation 4**: \"Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Nguyen Quoc Hien (right) participated in performing the anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"right.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Quoc Hien\" is not the correct transliteration of \"國恒.\" The correct transliteration is \"Quoc Heng.\"\n5. **Translation 5**: \"Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Guo Heng (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"participated.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Guo Heng\" is not the correct transliteration of \"阮國恒.\" \"阮\" is \"Nguyen,\" not \"Guo.\"\n6. **Translation 6**: \"Deputy CEO Nguyen Quoc Hien (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\"\n   - Strengths: Correct use of \"Nguyen\" and \"right.\"\n   - Weaknesses: \"Quoc Hien\" is not the correct transliteration of \"國恒.\" The correct transliteration is \"Quoc Heng.\"\nImprovements:\n- Use \"Deputy Chief Executive\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Nguyen Quoc Heng\" as the correct transliteration of \"阮國恒.\"\n- Use \"right\" in parentheses as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"participated in performing\" as the most natural phrasing.\nFinal Translation:\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Nguyen Quoc Heng (right) participated in performing an anti-fraud song.\n\nCross-media publicity activities strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase, \"跨媒體宣傳活動加強公眾防騙意識,\" translates to \"Cross-media publicity activities strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with slight differences in word choice and phrasing.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"cross-media\" to reflect \"跨媒體.\"\n- The term \"public\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"公眾.\"\n- The phrase \"fraud prevention\" is accurately used in all translations, capturing the meaning of \"防騙.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"promotion\" instead of \"publicity\" in some translations (e.g., \"promotional activities\") may not fully capture the nuance of \"宣傳,\" which is closer to \"publicity\" or \"promotion\" depending on context. However, \"publicity\" is more aligned with the intent of raising awareness.\n- Some translations use \"enhance\" while others use \"strengthen.\" Both are acceptable, but \"strengthen\" may be more direct in this context.\n- The use of \"the public's awareness\" in some translations adds a possessive form that is grammatically correct but slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Improvements:**\n- \"Publicity\" is a more precise translation of \"宣傳\" in the context of raising awareness.\n- \"Strengthen\" is a stronger and more direct verb than \"enhance\" in this context.\n- Using \"public awareness\" without the possessive form is more concise and natural in English.\n**Final Translation:**\nCross-media publicity activities strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\n\n# Cross-Border Financial Opportunities: A New Video Series\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency in conveying the original message. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound.\" However, it uses \"video series\" instead of \"television short film series,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate, with a slightly more formal tone. It correctly uses \"Northbound Channel\" and \"Southbound Channel,\" though \"short film series\" is more appropriate than \"television short film series.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several issues. It uses \"Cross-boundary Financial Opportunities\" instead of the correct title, and \"Cross-boundary Financial Connect\" instead of \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect.\" It also incorrectly uses \"Northbound Bond Connect\" and \"Southbound Bond Connect\" instead of just \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound.\" The term \"video station\" is also incorrect; it should be \"television station.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is one of the best translations. It uses the correct title, \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect (WMC),\" and accurately conveys the purpose of the series. It also uses \"well-received\" to describe the films, which is a natural choice.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with the correct use of \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" and \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound.\" However, it uses \"CWM\" instead of \"WMC\" and \"cross-boundary\" instead of \"cross-border,\" which are minor but important discrepancies.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation has several errors, including \"cross-boundary\" instead of \"cross-border,\" \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect\" instead of the correct title, and \"Northbound Bond Connect\" instead of \"Northbound.\" It also uses \"video provider\" instead of \"television station.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The correct title is \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect (WMC).\"\n- The term \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound\" should be used without \"Channel\" or \"Bond Connect.\"\n- \"Television station\" is more accurate than \"video station\" or \"video provider.\"\n- \"Cross-border\" is the correct term, not \"cross-boundary.\"\n- \"Classic scenes\" is more natural than \"classic scenes\" or \"iconic scenes.\"\n- The phrase \"help the public further understand\" is more natural than \"assist the public in further understanding.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has jointly produced with a local television station a television short film series titled \"New Opportunities in Cross-border Wealth Management\" to help the public further understand the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" (WMC) and the opportunities and convenience it brings to retail investors in cross-border investments. This series uses \"classic scenes\" from five well-received Hong Kong films to explain the framework of the WMC, the eligibility requirements for investors, the products offered by the Northbound and Southbound channels, risk management, and matters to be mindful of in cross-border investments. It will be promoted through television, digital, and social media platforms.\n\nThe original text is:  \n**短片以風趣幽默的方式介紹「跨境理財通」**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short film introduces \"cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" in a witty and humorous way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Wealth Management Connect\" and \"cross-border\" from the dictionary. The phrasing is fluent and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Short film\" is slightly more specific than \"short video,\" which may not be necessary. \"Witty and humorous\" is redundant; \"humorous\" alone suffices.  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces \"cross-border wealth management connect\" in a humorous and entertaining way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"short video\" and \"cross-border\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"wealth management connect\" is not capitalized, which may be inconsistent with the official term. \"Entertaining\" is less precise than \"humorous\" or \"witty.\"  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces \"cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" in a humorous and witty manner.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the term and structure. \"Humorous and witty\" is a good pairing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Manner\" is slightly less natural than \"way\" or \"method.\"  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces “Wealth Management Connect” in a humorous and engaging way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct term and structure. \"Engaging\" is a strong, natural choice.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted \"cross-border,\" which is a key part of the term.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video to promote “Wealth Management Connect” in a humorous and engaging manner.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct term and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"To promote\" is not the correct translation of \"介紹\" in this context. \"Introduce\" is more accurate. The sentence structure is awkward.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The short video introduces \"Wealth Management Connect\" in a humorous and funny way.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct term usage.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Funny\" is redundant with \"humorous.\" The phrase is less refined.  \n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use **\"Wealth Management Connect\"** (capitalized) as per the dictionary.\n- Include **\"cross-border\"** as it is a key modifier.\n- Use **\"introduces\"** for \"介紹.\"\n- Use **\"in a humorous and witty way\"** or similar to capture the nuance of \"風趣幽默.\"\n- Use **\"short video\"** as it is more natural than \"short film\" in this context.\n### Final Translation:\nThe short video introduces \"cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" in a humorous and witty way.\n\n# Hong Kong Money Management Championship\n\nTo enhance secondary students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority collaborates with various relevant institutions to organize the \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship.\" In 2024, the event marks its 10th anniversary, with the theme \"Future Financial Talent.\" It aims to enable secondary students to gain early awareness of developments and future trends in innovation, fintech, artificial intelligence, and other areas, as well as to promote students upholding sustainable development and environmental, social, and governance principles.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the term \"Championship\" for \"爭霸戰\" and the accurate translation of \"financial knowledge\" and \"popular financial topics.\" The use of \"mentorship format\" or \"mentoring format\" is also appropriate for \"師友形式.\" The term \"Greater Bay Area\" is correctly used for \"大灣區,\" and \"interaction and exchange\" is a suitable translation for \"互動交流.\"\nWeaknesses include:\n1. **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat the term \"Championship\" unnecessarily, such as \"online quiz Championship\" or \"Championship session.\" This can be simplified to \"online quiz\" or \"quiz session.\"\n2. **Inconsistent Use of Terms:** The term \"Youth Financial Talent Plan\" or \"Scheme\" is used inconsistently. The dictionary lists \"talent\" and \"talent pool\" as possible translations for \"人才,\" and \"Scheme\" or \"Plan\" for \"計劃.\" A more consistent and natural choice would be \"Youth Financial Talent Scheme\" or \"Youth Financial Talent Program.\"\n3. **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"setting a new high for the year\" or \"reaching a new high in history.\" A more natural expression would be \"setting a new record\" or \"setting a new high.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Greater Bay Area\" is more commonly used than \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao\" in English contexts, and it is more concise and widely recognized.\n5. **Numerical Expressions:** The phrase \"32,000 person-times\" is not standard in English. Instead, \"32,000 participants\" or \"32,000 students\" is more natural.\n6. **Use of \"Particularly\" vs. \"Further\":** The term \"particularly\" is not the best fit for \"更\" in the context of \"更特別增設.\" \"Further\" or \"further added\" is more appropriate.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be one that is fluent, grammatically correct, and uses natural English expressions while adhering to the dictionary's term mappings.\nThe final translation should:\n- Use \"Championship\" consistently for \"爭霸戰.\"\n- Use \"Youth Financial Talent Scheme\" for \"少年金融人才計劃.\"\n- Use \"mentorship format\" for \"師友形式.\"\n- Use \"Greater Bay Area\" for \"大灣區.\"\n- Use \"setting a new record\" for \"創下歷年新高.\"\n- Use \"further added\" for \"更特別增設.\"\n- Use \"promote interaction and exchange\" for \"促進粵港澳三地學生互動交流.\"\nWith these considerations in mind, the improved translation is as follows:\nThe first part of the Championship is an online quiz competition, testing students' financial knowledge and understanding of popular financial topics. In 2024, a total of 32,000 students from 290 secondary schools participated in the online quiz, setting a new record. Between 2015 and 2024, students from 440 secondary schools participated in the online quiz session of the Championship approximately 125,000 times. The second part of the Championship, the \"Youth Financial Talent Scheme,\" is conducted in a mentorship format, with experienced practitioners from different areas serving as mentors to train students for the \"Design Thinking Challenge.\" In 2024, this part of the Championship further added the \"Greater Bay Area Invitational\" to promote interaction and exchange among students from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Mr. Chen Weimin delivered a welcome speech at the Championship finals and encouraged the participants.\n\nStudents participating in the \"Youth Financial Talent Programme\" meet with their mentors.\n\n# Educational Board Game\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key term \"桌遊\" as \"board game\" and use it consistently.\n- The term \"首個\" is translated as \"first\" in all translations, which is accurate.\n- The year terms \"2023\" and \"2024\" are correctly used as \"2023\" and \"2024.\"\n- The term \"教育\" is translated as \"education\" or \"educational,\" which aligns with the dictionary options.\n- The term \"小學生\" is translated as \"primary school students,\" which is the most appropriate and precise option.\n- The term \"模擬\" is translated as \"simulated\" or \"simulation,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"支付\" is translated as \"payment methods,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"網絡\" is translated as \"cyber\" or \"cybersecurity,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"科技\" is translated as \"technology\" or \"fintech,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"概念\" is translated as \"concepts,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"用途\" is translated as \"role\" or \"purpose,\" which is acceptable.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly uses \"personnel\" for \"人\" and \"manage finances concepts\" for \"基本理財概念,\" which are not accurate or natural.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Financial\" in the title, which may not match the original Chinese title, and \"cyber security\" should be \"cybersecurity\" as one word.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"persons\" for \"人,\" which is overly formal and not natural in this context.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"HKMA\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is acceptable but may be less clear for general audiences.\n- Some translations use \"continued promoting\" or \"continued to promote,\" which is grammatically correct but could be more natural as \"continued to promote\" or \"continued its promotion.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n- Use \"board game\" consistently for \"桌遊.\"\n- Use \"primary school students\" for \"小學生.\"\n- Use \"simulated scenarios\" or \"simulated scenario\" for \"模擬情景.\"\n- Use \"cybersecurity\" as one word.\n- Use \"financial technology\" or \"fintech\" for \"金融科技.\"\n- Use \"more people\" for \"更多人.\"\n- Use \"enhance its role as an educational tool\" for \"加強其作為教育工具的用途.\"\n- Ensure the title \"$mart理財321\" is preserved as is, without altering \"理財\" to \"Financial.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched its first financial education board game, \"$smart理財321,\" in 2023 and continued to promote it in 2024, helping more people become familiar with this original board game and enhancing its role as an educational tool. The game enables primary school students to learn about different payment methods, basic financial concepts, financial technology, and cybersecurity through simulated scenarios.\n\nAt the community level, we set up a booth at the \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024\" and held workshops in the community during Christmas and the Lunar New Year, as well as parent-child workshops at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's office, further promoting financial and money management concepts. In addition, we arranged on-site activities at primary schools for primary school students to try out board games, and held training workshops to encourage secondary school teachers to use board games as one of the teaching materials in the new junior secondary subject \"Citizenship, Economics, and Society\" financial education module. Board games have been recognized by the Education Bureau as one of the outstanding teaching tools and were used as prizes for the winning schools in the \"Financial Education School Award Scheme\" (2023\/24). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority held approximately 40 board game workshops in 2024, attracting over 3,600 students, parents, teachers, and social workers to participate.\n\nBased on the provided translations, several observations can be made regarding translation quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness. All translations generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but there are notable differences in fluency and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"students\" and \"green\" for \"學生\" and \"綠色,\" respectively.\n- The term \"board game\" is consistently used for \"桌遊,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"launched\" is used for \"推出,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"financial\" or \"finance\" is used for \"金融,\" which is acceptable.\n- The term \"knowledge\" is used for \"知識,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"experience\" is used for \"經驗,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"Hong Kong\" is used for \"香港,\" which is correct.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"green finance\" for \"綠色金融,\" which is acceptable but \"green financial\" might be more precise in this context.\n- The third and sixth translations use the Chinese characters \"《企業綠化大變身》\" without translating them, which is not ideal. These should be translated as \"Corporate Green Transformation\" or a similar English title.\n- The term \"strategic\" is used in some translations for \"策略,\" which is acceptable, but \"strategy\" might be more natural in the context of a board game.\n- The term \"Deputy\" is listed in the dictionary for \"副,\" but it is not appropriate in this context. \"First\" or \"first-ever\" would be more suitable.\n- The term \"as a souvenir\" is used in most translations for \"作為紀念品送出,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"experience of developing\" is used for \"開發...的經驗基礎上,\" which is accurate but could be more natural as \"based on the experience of developing.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all terms in the dictionary are used appropriately and that the translations are fluent and natural.\n- Translate the game titles into English, using the most appropriate and natural-sounding English equivalents.\n- Use \"green financial knowledge\" instead of \"green finance knowledge\" for \"綠色金融知識.\"\n- Use \"first-ever\" or \"first\" to convey the meaning of \"全港首副.\"\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is natural and flows well in English.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nBased on the review and reasoning above, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is:\n\"Based on the experience of developing the board game '$mart Financial Management 321,' the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the strategy board game 'Corporate Green Transformation,' which was given out as a souvenir at the 'Hong Kong Book Fair 2024' booth. This is Hong Kong’s first-ever board game to convey green financial knowledge to students.\"\n\nFurthermore, we continue to support the work of the Investors and Financial Education Committee, enhancing the financial knowledge and money management capabilities of Hong Kong residents, and will study further collaboration with different stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community participation initiatives.\n\nThrough board game activities, promote financial education to teachers, students, and parents.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standards. The Financial Department prepares the Exchange Fund's financial statements with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals in accordance with Hong Kong's financial reporting standards. In addition, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of budget and expenditure data in the Annual Report (please refer to pages 193 to 194, \"Budget Preparation and Financial Control\").\n"}

關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2024年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及37.1。\n\n於2024年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共 39,151.17 億港元，金融負債共 13,862.99 億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n-

按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除特別註明外，所有金額均以港幣百萬元位列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

Report  \nFinancial Statements of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Audit Office Director's Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Office\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Feedback\nThe original text is simply the word \"意見\" (yìjiàn), which means \"opinion\" or \"suggestion\" in English. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations: \"advice,\" \"opinion,\" \"guidance,\" \"recommendations,\" \"advise,\" \"clarifications,\" and \"feedback.\" However, the most direct and commonly used translation is \"opinion.\"\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly correct, but they vary in formatting and choice of word. The first, third, fourth, and fifth translators used \"Opinion\" or \"Advice,\" which are both valid, though \"opinion\" is more direct. The second and sixth translators added a \"#\" symbol before the word, which may be an attempt to format the text as a heading or section title, but it is not necessary unless specified in the original text.\nThe best translation would be \"Opinion\" without any additional formatting, as it is the most accurate and natural translation of \"意見\" in this context.\n# Opinion\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") set out on pages 209 to 309, which include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, the income and expenditure accounts for the year ended on that date, the comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policy information.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and they present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six junior translations and identified several key areas for improvement. All translations generally convey the core meaning of the original text, but there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nStrengths include the consistent use of \"Chief Executive\" for \"行政長官,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" for \"外匯基金條例,\" and \"audit\" for \"審計.\" However, some translations use \"Audit Department\" instead of \"Audit Commission\" or \"Audit Bureau,\" which may not be accurate depending on the jurisdiction. The term \"Audit Commission\" is more commonly used in Hong Kong contexts.\nThe word \"須\" is consistently translated as \"shall,\" which is correct. However, \"已\" is sometimes translated as \"have already\" or \"already,\" which is acceptable, but \"have\" is more natural in formal writing. The term \"集團\" is translated as \"the Group\" or \"group,\" which is appropriate.\nThe term \"意見\" is translated as \"opinion\" in most translations, which is correct. However, in the fifth translation, \"opinion\" is used without the word \"audit,\" which is an omission. The term \"基礎\" is translated as \"basis\" or \"foundation,\" which is appropriate.\nThe term \"審計師\" is translated as \"auditor\" or \"auditor's,\" which is correct. However, in the fifth translation, \"Auditor's\" is used without a possessive form, which is grammatically incorrect.\nThe term \"準則\" is translated as \"Standards\" or \"standards,\" which is correct. However, in the fifth translation, \"Standards\" is capitalized inconsistently.\nThe term \"報告\" is translated as \"report\" or \"Report,\" which is correct. However, in the fifth translation, \"Report\" is capitalized inconsistently.\nThe term \"發出\" is translated as \"issued\" or \"provided,\" which is correct. However, in the fifth translation, \"directions\" is used instead of \"instructions,\" which is a minor deviation.\nThe term \"審計憑證\" is translated as \"audit evidence,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"獨立\" is translated as \"independent,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"責任\" is translated as \"responsibility\" or \"responsibilities,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"財務\" is translated as \"financial,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"基金\" is translated as \"Fund\" or \"Exchange Fund,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"提供\" is translated as \"provide\" or \"provides,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"等\" is translated as \"etc.,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"為\" is translated as \"to\" or \"for,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"表\" is translated as \"Table\" or \"table,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"行政\" is translated as \"Chief Executive\" or \"administrative,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"外\" is translated as \"external\" or \"foreign,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"載\" is translated as \"set out\" or \"included,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"審計\" is translated as \"audit,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"下\" is translated as \"under\" or \"in,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"準則\" is translated as \"Standards\" or \"criteria,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"匯\" is translated as \"exchange,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"「\" is translated as \"“\" or \"''\", which is correct.\nThe term \"並已\" is translated as \"have already\" or \"are now,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"長\" is translated as \"long\" or \"long-term,\" which is correct.\nThe term \"承擔\" is translated as \"exposure\" or \"exposures,\" which is incorrect. The correct translation is \"responsibility\" or \"responsibilities.\"\nThe term \"」\" is translated as \"”\" or \"''\", which is correct.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"Audit Commission\" for \"審計署,\" \"auditor\" for \"審計師,\" \"audit\" for \"審計,\" \"audit evidence\" for \"審計憑證,\" \"independent\" for \"獨立,\" \"responsibility\" for \"責任,\" \"sufficient\" for \"充足,\" \"Group\" for \"集團,\" \"basis\" for \"基礎,\" \"provide\" for \"提供,\" \"report\" for \"報告,\" \"etc.\" for \"等,\" \"issued\" for \"發出,\" \"section\" for \"部分,\" \"Standards\" for \"準則,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" for \"外匯基金條例,\" \"Chief Executive\" for \"行政長官,\" \"external\" for \"外,\" \"set out\" for \"載,\" \"financial\" for \"財務,\" \"Fund\" for \"基金,\" \"to\" for \"為,\" \"Table\" for \"表,\" \"administration\" for \"行政,\" \"audit\" for \"審計,\" \"under\" for \"下,\" \"Standards\" for \"準則,\" \"exchange\" for \"匯,\" \"“\" for \"「,\" \"have already\" for \"並已,\" \"long\" for \"長,\" and \"responsibilities\" for \"承擔.\"\nI have now produced the best possible translation based on this review.\n\n# Critical Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, based on my professional judgment, are most significant for the audit of the annual financial statements as at December 31, 2024. I addressed these matters in the audit of the overall financial statements and in forming my opinion, and I will not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 37.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$391.5117 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$138.6299 billion.\n\n86% of these financial assets and all such financial liabilities have a fair value that is either the quoted price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation methods, with the inputs used based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 14% of these financial assets’ fair value is estimated using valuation methods, and the inputs used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets total HK$5,522.51 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of dictionary terms: \"audit,\" \"financial,\" \"assets and,\" \"liabilities,\" \"fair value,\" \"valuation.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"measured at fair value\" is slightly awkward; \"valued at fair value\" is more natural in financial contexts.\n2. **Translation 2:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for valuing financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as above, with \"valuing\" instead of \"valuation of.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"measured at fair value\" is still slightly off; \"valued at fair value\" is more idiomatic.\n3. **Translation 3:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"regarding\" for a more formal tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"measured at fair value\" is not the most natural phrasing in English financial terminology.\n4. **Translation 4:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for valuing financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 2.**\n5. **Translation 5:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 3.**\n6. **Translation 6:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is a more precise financial term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"accounted for\" is slightly more complex than necessary; \"valued at fair value\" is more commonly used in audit contexts.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The phrase **\"按公平值列帳\"** should be translated as **\"accounted for at fair value\"** or **\"valued at fair value.\"** While both are acceptable, **\"valued at fair value\"** is more commonly used in audit and financial reporting contexts.\n- The phrase **\"金融資產及金融負債\"** is best translated as **\"financial assets and liabilities\"** (using \"assets and\" from the dictionary).\n- The word **\"程序\"** is best translated as **\"procedures\"** in this context.\n- The word **\"審計\"** is best translated as **\"audit.\"**\n- The word **\"包括\"** is best translated as **\"include.\"**\n### Final Translation:\nThe audit procedures for valuing financial assets and liabilities at fair value include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring measures.\n\nEvaluation and testing of monitoring measures, including monitoring measures related to computer system applications.\n\nObtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nIf using market quotations, verify the price according to independent sources.\n\nIf the inputs used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the inputs based on independent sources; and\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater clarity and fluency in English.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of key terms such as \"valuation method,\" \"inputs,\" \"observable market data,\" \"related assumptions,\" and \"independent sources.\" These terms align well with the dictionary provided, and the overall structure of the sentences is logical and grammatically sound.\nWeaknesses include minor variations in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency. For example, \"assess\" and \"evaluate\" are both acceptable, but \"evaluate\" is slightly more formal and precise in this context. Similarly, \"verify the parameters based on independent sources\" is slightly more natural than \"verify the parameters using independent sources,\" though both are correct.\nThe use of \"inputs\" for \"參數\" is more appropriate in a financial or technical context than \"parameters,\" as \"inputs\" better reflects the role of these values in a valuation model. Additionally, the phrase \"based on\" is more idiomatic than \"according to\" in this context.\nThe best translation would use \"inputs\" for \"參數,\" \"evaluate\" for \"評價,\" and \"based on\" for \"根據.\" It should also maintain parallel structure in the sentence for clarity and readability.\nThe final translation provided by the fifth junior translator is very close to the ideal version, with only minor adjustments needed for optimal fluency and precision.\n\nIf the inputs used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is a formal, regulatory-style statement that requires precise and professional translation. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and word choice.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"inputs\" and \"assess,\" which are appropriate. However, \"assess\" is slightly less formal than \"evaluate,\" which may be more suitable in a regulatory or financial context.\n- **Translation 2** is very close to the ideal version, using \"evaluate\" and maintaining the structure of the original sentence. It is fluent and grammatically correct.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"is the assessment... suitable\" and \"are... reasonable,\" which is grammatically awkward and less direct than the other translations.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"parameters\" instead of \"inputs,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary. While \"parameters\" is a valid synonym, \"inputs\" is more precise in the context of valuation methods.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"determine\" instead of \"evaluate,\" which is slightly more formal and may be acceptable, but \"evaluate\" is more commonly used in this context.\n- **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the placement of \"used,\" which does not significantly affect the meaning.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"inputs\" as per the dictionary, as it is more precise in the context of valuation methods.\n- Use \"evaluate\" for consistency with regulatory and financial terminology.\n- Maintain the structure of the original sentence to preserve clarity and formality.\n**Final Translation:**\nIf the inputs used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese text is a title or heading, likely from a financial or accounting document. The key terms to translate are \"值\" (value), \"投資物業\" (investment properties), and \"公平\" (fair). According to the dictionary, \"值\" should be translated as \"value,\" \"投資物業\" as \"investment properties,\" and \"公平\" as \"fair.\" The term \"列帳\" is not in the dictionary, but based on context, it refers to how the investment properties are recorded or carried on the books, so \"carried\" is an appropriate choice.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in style and accuracy. The first translation, \"Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value,\" is grammatically correct but uses \"measured,\" which is less common in accounting terminology than \"carried\" or \"accounted for.\" The second and fifth translations use \"Recorded\" and \"Accounted for,\" respectively, which are both acceptable but \"carried\" is more standard in financial reporting. The third and sixth translations use \"Accounted for\" and \"Carried,\" respectively, with the latter being the most accurate and natural in this context. The fourth translation is similar to the first but uses \"accounted for,\" which is slightly less precise than \"carried.\"\nThe best translation should use \"carried\" to reflect the standard accounting terminology, and it should maintain the title format with a leading \"#\". Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation is \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value.\"\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$211.32 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also holds interests in associated companies and joint ventures, which primarily engage in the business of holding overseas investment properties. Regardless of whether the investment properties are held directly by the Group or through associated companies or joint ventures, their fair values are primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：**\nThe sentence structure is a list of audit procedures related to the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"audit procedures\" and \"investment properties measured at fair value.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"measured at fair value\" is slightly less common than \"accounted for at fair value\" in accounting contexts.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of \"audit,\" \"procedures,\" \"investment properties,\" and \"fair.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for valuing investment properties carried at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Natural phrasing with \"valuing investment properties.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Carried at fair value\" is not a standard term in accounting. \"Accounted for at fair value\" is more precise.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of \"audit,\" \"procedures,\" \"investment properties,\" and \"fair.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is standard in accounting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy with \"the valuation of investment properties.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of all relevant terms.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of all relevant terms.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value includes audit procedures.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"accounted for at fair value.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is awkward and reverses the subject and object.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of all relevant terms.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, the audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than necessary.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct use of all relevant terms.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use standard accounting terminology. \"Accounted for at fair value\" is the most accurate and commonly used phrase in accounting. \"Audit procedures\" is the correct term for the audit process. The phrase \"for valuing investment properties\" is more natural than \"for the valuation of investment properties.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associated companies or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports.\n\nAssess the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and\n\nAssess whether the valuation method is appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority shall be responsible for other information. Other information includes all information in the Monetary Authority's 2024 annual report, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not issue any form of attestation conclusion regarding other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# The Monetary Authority and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee shall bear responsibility for the financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority shall be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Accounting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority shall be responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and shall use the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s audits committee is responsible for supervision of the Group’s financial reporting.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"審核委員會\" as \"Audit Committee\" and \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"audits committee\" instead of \"Audit Committee\" (should be capitalized). Also, \"supervision of the Group’s financial reporting\" is slightly awkward; \"supervising the financial reporting process\" is more natural.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of the Group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate structure, correct use of \"Audit Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"of the Group\" is slightly less natural than \"of the Group’s.\"\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Very close to the best version. Correct use of terms and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None significant.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 3.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 3.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee under the Exchange Fund is responsible for the supervision of the Group’s financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"supervision of the Group’s financial reporting process,\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly translates \"審核委員會\" as \"Advisory Committee\" instead of \"Audit Committee.\" Also, \"under the Exchange Fund\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Audit Committee\" for \"審核委員會.\"\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" for \"外匯基金諮詢委員會.\"\n- Use \"supervising the Group's financial reporting process\" for \"負責監督集團的財務報告過程.\"\n- Ensure correct capitalization and natural phrasing.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The original title, \"# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任,\" translates to \"The auditor's responsibility regarding the audit of financial statements that must be borne.\" The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to render the title accordingly.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The auditor's exposure to the responsibility in the financial statement audit shall...?\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"exposure\" from the dictionary for \"承擔.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Exposure\" is not the best fit for \"承擔\" in this context. The sentence is incomplete and ends with an ellipsis, which is unprofessional for a title.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The auditor's responsibilities regarding the audit of financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"responsibilities\" from the dictionary for \"責任\" and \"audit\" for \"審計.\" The structure is clear and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted \"須\" (shall) and \"財務報表\" (financial statements), which are key elements of the original title.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Auditors shall bear responsibilities for the financial audit.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"shall\" for \"須\" and \"bear\" for \"承擔.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial audit\" is too vague; the original specifies \"財務報表審計\" (audit of financial statements).\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The responsibility that auditors shall bear regarding the audit of financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"shall bear\" for \"須承擔\" and includes \"audit of financial statements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Responsibility\" is singular, but the original uses \"責任\" which can be plural. The phrasing is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"# Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the meaning and uses \"responsibilities\" and \"audit of financial statements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title is overly formal and lacks the nuance of \"須承擔\" (must bear).\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Responsibility of the Auditor for the Audit of Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"responsibility\" and \"audit of financial statements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Responsibility\" is singular, and the title is too brief and lacks the nuance of \"須承擔.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"responsibilities\" for \"責任\" (as it is plural and more appropriate for a title).\n- Use \"shall\" for \"須.\"\n- Use \"audit of financial statements\" for \"財務報表審計.\"\n- Maintain a professional and clear title structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements are free from material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material misstatements if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, may influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Office, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and execute audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or situations where internal controls are overridden, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error.\n\nTo understand internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not aimed at expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.\n\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n\nDetermine whether the Monetary Authority's practice of using continuing operations as the accounting basis is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements within the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I shall issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained as at the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may result in the Group being unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect transactions and matters; and\n\nPlan and execute the Group audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business units within the Group, as a basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for guiding, supervising, and reviewing the audit work performed in connection with the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeframe of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal control that I identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements related to independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be

several strengths and weaknesses are evident. The translations generally capture the core meaning of the original text, which outlines the process of identifying key audit matters and the conditions under which they may not be disclosed in the auditor's report. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the determination of key audit matters, and the conditions for non-disclosure.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms such as \"auditor's report,\" \"key audit matters,\" and \"public interest.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"I determine\" and \"I describe,\" which is grammatically correct but lacks the formal tone expected in an audit context.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"legal regulations\" instead of \"laws and regulations,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 3** has several grammatical errors, such as \"I decide are to not disclose,\" and uses \"Advisory Committee under the Advisory Committees,\" which is redundant and incorrect.\n- **Translation 4** omits the source of the matters (\"from matters communicated by...\") and uses \"adverse consequences resulting from the reasonable expectation,\" which is awkwardly phrased.\n- **Translation 5** is the most accurate in terms of structure and tone, but it omits the phrase \"unless legal regulations do not allow for public disclosure\" and instead uses \"prohibit public disclosure,\" which is slightly different in nuance.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the correct meaning and uses \"legal requirements\" instead of \"laws and regulations,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that the source of the matters is clearly stated: \"From matters communicated by the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n- Use \"laws and regulations\" for consistency with the dictionary term \"法律法規.\"\n- Use \"public disclosure\" as per the dictionary term \"公開披露.\"\n- Ensure that the condition for non-disclosure is clearly stated: \"unless laws and regulations prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are reasonably expected to outweigh the public interest.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nFrom matters communicated by the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the current period's financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are reasonably expected to outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Financial Statement Notes\n\nExcept where specially noted, all amounts are listed in Hong Kong dollars in units of million.\n\n# 1 Main Business\n\nThe Monetary Authority, acting in its capacity as the Fund manager, manages the Fund in accordance with the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary under the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund's primary functions are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency and financial system.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and fluent. It correctly uses \"monetary base\" and \"OECD member countries.\" However, \"Monetary Authority system\" is not accurate; the correct term from the dictionary is \"system\" under \"制度,\" and the correct reference is \"Hong Kong's monetary issuance system\" or \"Hong Kong's currency issuance system.\" Also, \"the Fund\" should be capitalized consistently.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's issuance system\" correctly, capitalizes \"Fund\" appropriately, and uses \"set out\" for \"載.\" However, \"issuance system\" may not be the best match for \"制度\" in this context; \"system\" alone might be more appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several issues. It incorrectly uses \"Exchange Fund Fund system\" instead of \"monetary issuance system.\" It also misuses \"monetary foundation\" instead of \"monetary base.\" Additionally, it incorrectly states that the shares are \"included in the fund’s accounts of Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited,\" which is not accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"monetary base\" correctly, capitalizes \"Fund\" consistently, and uses \"set out\" for \"載.\" It also correctly refers to \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority system\" and \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"monetary base\" and \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" correctly. It also uses \"published\" for \"載,\" which is acceptable, though \"set out\" might be more precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most comprehensive and accurate translation. It correctly uses \"monetary issuance system\" for \"制度,\" capitalizes \"Fund\" and \"Fund's\" appropriately, and includes \"HKEX\" as an abbreviation for \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\" It also correctly identifies the company as incorporated in Hong Kong SAR.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"monetary issuance system\" for \"制度\" as it is the most precise match.\n- Capitalize \"Fund\" consistently.\n- Use \"set out\" for \"載\" as it is the most natural and precise term in this context.\n- Use \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" as the full form.\n- Ensure that \"the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government\" is used consistently.\n- Use \"shares\" for \"股票\" and \"private equity\" for \"私募股權.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Fund's assets are managed in four separate portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. According to Hong Kong's monetary issuance system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched with the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio mainly invests in the bond and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for strategic purposes and are included in the Fund's accounts. Information on the operating segments is set out in Note 31.\n"}
