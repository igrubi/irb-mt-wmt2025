{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n#

challenges.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 spread widely, continuing to pressure global economic growth and keeping inflationary pressures on the rise. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further increased inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies, increasing volatility in global financial markets and exacerbating the risk of slower economic growth. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic broke out, with a rapid rise in infection cases, further impacting the economy. At the same time, negative reports surrounding COVID-related restrictions led to misunderstandings about Hong Kong, threatening its reputation as an international financial center. For the whole year, Hong Kong's real GDP contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, and has advanced multiple measures conducive to development in key strategic areas, further consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. After three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations, allowing travelers to once again visit in person and experience the city firsthand. Last November, the HKMA hosted the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, drawing financial leaders from around the world to attend in person. The enthusiastic response from the outside world has become the clearest evidence of Hong Kong's full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the resumption of economic activity on the mainland will inject renewed impetus into Hong Kong and the wider region. The HKMA will continue to stand firm in its role, fulfilling its function of maintaining Hong Kong’s currency and Banking Stability, and actively seeking more opportunities that benefit Hong Kong’s development, demonstrating and enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. We will also continue to contribute to enhancing global climate resilience and sustainable development. This year, in addition to the Annual Report 2022, we will also publish the Sustainability Report 2022, to provide a more detailed introduction to the work the HKMA has done to enhance Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable organisation.\n\n# Currency and Financial System: As Stable as Ever\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS),\" \"HK$242.1 billion,\" \"US Federal Reserve (Fed),\" \"HKMA,\" \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU),\" \"exchange value,\" \"currency markets,\" and \"HKD.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure.\n- Proper use of formal and professional language suitable for economic and financial contexts.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Some translations use \"exchange value\" instead of \"exchange rate,\" which is less common in financial contexts.\n- A few translations use \"money markets\" instead of \"currency markets,\" which may be less precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"the resilience of the LERS was once again demonstrated\" is repeated in several translations, which, while accurate, lacks variation and could be phrased more dynamically.\n- Some translations use \"function smoothly\" or \"operate smoothly,\" which are both acceptable, but \"operate smoothly\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\nImprovements could include:\n- Using \"exchange rate\" instead of \"exchange value\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Ensuring consistency in the use of \"currency markets\" rather than \"money markets.\"\n- Varying the phrasing of \"resilience was demonstrated\" to avoid repetition.\n- Ensuring that the sentence structure is varied and that the flow of ideas is smooth and natural.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of all versions while addressing the noted weaknesses for clarity, fluency, and precision.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in place since 1983 and has successfully withstood various external shocks across multiple economic cycles. In 2022, the resilience of the LERS was once again demonstrated. Under the significant tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner according to the established mechanism. During this period, the HKD exchange rate and currency markets continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"國際貨幣基金組織\" as \"International Monetary Fund,\" \"2022年對外部門報告\" as \"External Sector Report 2022,\" and \"聯匯制度\" as \"LERS.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about the credibility of LERS is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"prudent fiscal policies,\" \"sound financial regulation,\" and \"flexible economic structure\" is appropriate and aligns with the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the credibility of the LERS is based on multiple factors\" (Translation 1) or \"the credibility of LERS is based on several factors\" (Translation 2). While grammatically correct, \"is based on\" can be replaced with more natural alternatives like \"rests on\" or \"is grounded in.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"fiscal system\" (Translation 1, 3), while others use \"fiscal policies\" (Translation 2, 4, 5, 6). \"Fiscal system\" is more precise in this context, as it refers to the institutional framework, not just policies.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** The phrase \"the credibility of the LERS\" is repeated in several translations, which can be streamlined for better flow.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** Some translations use quotation marks around the report title inconsistently (e.g., Translation 3 uses quotes, while others do not). The title should be italicized or in quotes consistently, depending on style preference.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"rests on\" or \"is grounded in\" instead of \"is based on.\"\n- Maintain consistent terminology, such as \"fiscal system\" or \"fiscal policies,\" depending on the intended meaning.\n- Avoid repetition by rephrasing the sentence structure where possible.\n- Ensure consistent use of quotation marks or italics for the report title.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThis confidence in the LERS stems from its solid foundation built over many years. As the International Monetary Fund reiterated in its *External Sector Report 2022*, the credibility of the LERS rests on multiple factors, including transparent operational rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, a prudent fiscal system, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, actively communicating with the public and the market to deepen their understanding of the LERS, conducting effective market surveillance, and preparing contingency plans for different scenarios all contribute to strengthening confidence in the LERS across all sectors. Our social media campaigns promoting the LERS operational mechanisms have helped effectively maintain market confidence in the LERS despite the multiple triggers of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking this year. Internally, the HKMA has also made good use of data analytics technology to strengthen market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nThroughout the year, despite macroeconomic challenges and increasing credit risks, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity positions. At the end of 2022, the consolidated capital ratio of local banks was 20.1%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of major banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirements of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system slightly deteriorated, with the classified loan ratio rising to 1.38% at the end of 2022. However, this level remained robust and was still below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Operational Resilience\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all quite accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. Each version effectively conveys the core message of the original Chinese text: that despite the intensification of challenges over the past three years of the pandemic, Hong Kong's banking system has remained stable due to sound risk management and regulation, and continues to support the economy.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate translation of key concepts such as \"pandemic,\" \"geopolitical tensions,\" \"monetary policies,\" \"risk management,\" and \"regulation.\"\n- Proper use of formal and professional tone, appropriate for the context of economic and financial reporting.\n- Correct use of grammar and sentence structure in English.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use slightly less precise terms, such as \"sound\" versus \"prudent\" for risk management, or \"resilient\" versus \"stable\" for describing the banking system.\n- There is some repetition in phrasing, such as \"challenges from all aspects\" or \"challenges from various fronts,\" which could be varied for better readability.\n- The phrase \"continued to play an important role\" appears in multiple translations and could be rephrased for variety and impact.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would aim to:\n- Use precise and varied vocabulary to enhance readability and impact.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, particularly for financial and regulatory terms.\n- Maintain a formal yet natural tone, avoiding overly repetitive structures.\nImproved Translation:\nThe pandemic has persisted for three years, intensifying challenges from various fronts, such as the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. However, thanks to years of prudent risk management and effective regulation, Hong Kong's banking system has maintained its stability and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the major regulatory challenges faced over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide the necessary support to customers while maintaining robust management of credit risk, amidst ongoing economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" plan has been further extended and now includes a voluntary partial repayment option, allowing borrowers to choose to start repaying part of the principal, helping customers prepare for a return to normal repayment schedules.\n\nIn response to the significant tightening of monetary policies by major economies leading to increased market volatility, another key regulatory task for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in 2022 was to strengthen oversight of banks' market and liquidity risk commitments. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impacts of synchronized monetary policy tightening across economies, and introduced new scenarios for stress-testing to evaluate banks' resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. In terms of operational and cyber resilience, we provide guidance to help banks establish comprehensive and holistic operational frameworks to achieve sound operations, and offer detailed supervisory guidance on specific operational areas, such as providing guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. Additionally, in response to the accelerated development of digitalization, we have also strengthened efforts to combat phishing scams and to advance consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call for providing basic banking services, with some banks setting up new branches and self-service facilities in large public housing estates in new development areas. Affected by pandemic-related travel restrictions, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to use their Mainland accounts. In view of this, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to help restart approximately 500,000 Mainland accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without needing to travel to the Mainland in person.\n\nAnother strategically important area for the sustained development of the banking industry is capacity building. To expand their operations, the banking industry continues to have a significant demand for professional talent. Building on its talent development strategy — \"Connecting Talent to the Future\" — the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced several measures over the past year to help the banking industry attract, nurture, and retain talent, focusing on upskilling and reskilling existing practitioners, as well as cultivating the younger generation, to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International Financial Center: Hong Kong Returns to the Global Stage!\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: “Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit” and “No. 8 typhoon signal.”\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message—that Hong Kong is recovering and re-engaging with the global community—is well conveyed.\n- The use of terms like “ripple effect,” “fully recovered,” and “demonstrating vitality” is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as “After implementing for a long time” (1st translation) or “we have made extensive efforts” (4th translation), which are less natural in English.\n- **Word Choice:** The term “multi-faceted efforts” (2nd and 3rd translations) is slightly more formal than “concerted efforts” or “efforts in many areas,” which may not be the most natural choice in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as “global financial institutions” and “international organizations” being mentioned multiple times in close proximity.\n- **Tense and Voice:** The use of “we have made” (4th translation) is slightly less formal than “we made” or “we have made concerted efforts,” which may not align with the tone of the original text.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, natural, and maintain the formal yet positive tone of the original.\n- It should avoid redundancy and use precise, commonly used terms.\n- The phrase “made concerted efforts” (6th translation) is more natural and impactful than “made multi-faceted efforts” or “made efforts in many areas.”\n- The phrase “fully resumed normalcy” (6th translation) is more natural than “fully recovered” or “fully returned to normalcy.”\n- The use of “senior representatives” (6th translation) is more precise than “international and regional heads” or “executives.”\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe pandemic-related travel restrictions, which had been in place for a long time, were gradually lifted in 2022, and we made concerted efforts to bring Hong Kong back to the international stage. The “Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit” held in November attracted more than 200 senior representatives from global financial institutions, drawing widespread attention and enthusiastic responses from around the world. Although the summit coincided with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, it was still a great success, sending a strong message to the world that Hong Kong has fully resumed normalcy and is demonstrating unprecedented vitality and energy. We are pleased to see the positive ripple effect of the summit, with many global financial institutions and international organizations either already holding or planning to hold various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from all over the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have come to appreciate the importance of face-to-face communication and engagement. Therefore, we make every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and use overseas visits to meet with senior management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the various opportunities offered under \"one country, two systems.\"\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we continue to push the boundaries in strategic areas such as financial technology, Mainland opportunities, and Green and Sustainable Finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong’s financial platform to provide top-tier services and attract more businesses to establish themselves here. For details on the HKMA’s work in Green and Sustainable Finance, please refer to the Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n# fintech\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and prepositions. The term \"金融科技2025\" is correctly translated as \"Fintech 2025\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary entry. The use of \"made significant progress\" is consistent across most translations, while \"achieved significant progress\" and \"have made significant progress\" are also grammatically correct but slightly vary in tense and nuance.\nThe preposition \"across\" in the first translation is more natural in this context than \"in\" when referring to progress across multiple areas. Additionally, the use of \"following the announcement\" is more precise than \"following the release,\" which may imply a different kind of publication or distribution.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"made significant progress across all five areas\" to convey the breadth of the progress, and maintain the past tense to reflect the completed actions in 2022. The final translation should be concise, natural, and grammatically correct, while adhering to the dictionary's specified term.\n\nWe have achieved ideal results in our work on \"comprehensively promoting banking digitalization.\" According to the results of the Tech Baseline Assessment, the Hong Kong banking industry has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, and the categories of technology adopted continue to increase. Our gradual promotion and support of digitalization since 2017 have received active responses from banks and continue to yield encouraging results. We will continue to closely collaborate with the industry to further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and to foster the development of individual technology categories based on the assessment results.\n\nThis year, we have made significant progress in our work on Central Bank Digital Currencies. The \"Multiple CBDC Bridge\" (mBridge) project has entered the pilot phase and has become one of the first globally to conduct real settlements for cross-border transactions by businesses. At the retail front, technical testing for cross-border use of e-CNY has entered its second phase, primarily testing the topping-up of e-CNY wallets through the Faster Payment System (FPS). Regarding e-HKD, we will adopt a three-rail approach to prepare for the potential future issuance of e-HKD and launch the Rail 2 Pilot, inviting the industry to deeply explore feasible application scenarios for e-HKD.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of fintech. The \"Commercial Data Interchange\" (CDI), launched in October last year, marks a significant step in enhancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure. As a consent-based common data infrastructure, the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" enables financial institutions to access corporate data, making it easier for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, totaling more than HKD 1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the need to monitor and address potential risks arising from related developments. We are closely watching the evolution of virtual assets and participating in international discussions on their regulation. After considering the opinions gathered through public consultation and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" to establish the regulatory regime for stablecoins and define their regulatory scope. In the future, our regulatory focus will initially target stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as these stablecoins may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with appropriate regulations in place, the industry can more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking industry are actively preparing to embrace this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of financial technology and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n# Mainland opportunities\n"}
{"zh":"# 2022年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n受第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境等多項不利因素的影響，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場首先轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年繼續保持穩健，資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素繼續處於健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n隨着美國收緊貨幣政策，港元轉弱，弱方兌換保證於年內被多次觸發。然而，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持有序及暢順運作，一再證明聯繫匯率制度穩健有效。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，外匯基金錄得整體投資回報率為負4.5%，與市場上大部分多元資產基金的表現相比，虧損幅度相對溫和。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推動負責任投資及資產多元化。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n面對金融市場波動擴大，金管局加強對銀行的信用及市場風險管理的監管，並與銀行緊密合作，提升銀行的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力，以應對網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快的情況。\n\n金管局進一步推出有關「先買後付」產品及新增物業轉按支付安排的消費者保障措施。此外，金管局與其他監管機構合作制定虛擬資產監管架構，並就分銷投資產品發出指引及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」亦於年內啟用。\n\n金管局繼續與銀行合作提升香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統，並加強對騙案的回應措施，又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動數據與科技的應用，以及加快金管局就反洗錢工作採用監管科技的步伐。\n\n金管局在本地實施有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。金管局亦與銀行業共同為未來發展努力建立可持續的人才庫及提升從業員的技能。\n\n為確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制，金管局制定新處置標準，又進行地區危機模擬演習，並在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，為處置機制的發展立下重要的里程碑。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」取得成功，鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，並製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n中國人民銀行與金管局之間的貨幣互換協議於年內優化，進一步鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。金管局亦與其他監管機構及持份者合作，籌備開通「互換通」，及推出配合人民幣計價股票在港交易的雙櫃台莊家機制。另又致力發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。\n\n在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。\n\n金管局亦繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界採用金融科技，並提升香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」隨着功能提升，使用量穩步增長。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持有效聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內，金管局悉心建立一支強調靈活應變及可持續發展的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升資訊科技能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy significantly contracted in 2022 due to multiple adverse factors, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightened financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labor market initially deteriorated but gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between Mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained sound in 2022, with capital and liquidity conditions remaining ample, and asset quality continuing to be at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAs the United States tightens its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar has weakened, and the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking has been triggered multiple times this year. However, the exchange and money markets for HKD have continued to operate in an orderly and smooth manner, repeatedly demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"asset classes,\" \"multi-asset funds,\" \"investment return,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" The core message is preserved in all versions, and the structure of the sentences is consistent with the original Chinese.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and natural English phrasing.\n- Proper use of grammar and sentence structure.\n- Consistent interpretation of the comparison between the Exchange Fund and multi-asset funds.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The use of \"negative 4.5%\" versus \"-4.5%\": While both are correct, \"-4.5%\" is more standard in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"a loss that was relatively mild\" versus \"which was relatively moderate\" versus \"resulted in relatively mild losses\": These variations are stylistic, but \"relatively mild losses\" is slightly more direct and concise.\n- The placement of \"compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market\" can be streamlined for better flow.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translators' work while optimizing for fluency and conciseness.\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -4.5%, which was relatively mild compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market.\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously.\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously. The Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -4.5%, which was relatively mild compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, tone, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Responsible investment,\" \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" \"annualised internal rate of return,\" and \"inception.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"annualised internal rate of return\" is accurate and appropriate in a financial context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"actively promote,\" which is slightly more vigorous than the original, but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"strive to promote,\" which is more passive and less direct than the original.\n- **Translation 3** uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the acronym \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less concise.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"was 12.6%\" with the past tense, which may imply the rate is no longer current, whereas the original suggests it is ongoing.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"is also continuing to promote,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Responsible investment\" with a capital \"R,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry and may be seen as a stylistic error.\n**Improvements:**\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is more concise and appropriate in a formal or professional context.\n- The phrase \"since its inception in 2009\" is more natural than \"since inception in 2009.\"\n- The use of the present perfect tense (\"has achieved\") is more appropriate than the simple past (\"was\") to indicate an ongoing result.\n- The phrase \"continues to promote\" is more direct and aligns better with the original tone than \"strive to promote\" or \"is also continuing to promote.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nFacing increased volatility in financial markets, the HKMA has strengthened its supervision of banks' credit and market risk management and is working closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience in response to the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"property refinancing,\" \"regulatory regime,\" and \"Credit Reference Platform.\"\n- Most translations maintain the structure and flow of the original text, ensuring clarity and coherence.\n- The use of \"MCRAs\" as an acronym for \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies\" is appropriately included in several translations, enhancing readability.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and Timing:** Some translations use inconsistent verb tenses. For example, the fourth translation uses \"will also be activated within the year,\" which implies a future action, whereas the original text uses \"亦於年內啟用,\" suggesting completion within the year. The fifth and sixth translations use \"was also activated this year\" and \"will also be operational within the year,\" respectively, which are both acceptable but the former is more aligned with the original.\n- **Verb Choice:** The first translation uses \"launched,\" while the second and third use \"launched,\" and the fifth uses \"activated.\" \"Launched\" is more natural in this context than \"activated.\"\n- **Redundancy and Flow:** The third translation includes \"has also been launched this year,\" which is slightly wordy. The fifth translation is more concise and natural.\n- **Clarity of \"Pay Later\":** Some translations use \"Pay Later\" while others use \"Buy Now.\" The original text uses \"先買後付,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Pay Later\" rather than \"Buy Now,\" as \"Buy Now\" is more commonly associated with \"buy now, pay later\" in English, which is slightly different in nuance.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms.\n- Maintain consistent tense and timing.\n- Use natural and fluent English.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary wordiness.\n- Choose the most accurate and context-appropriate translation for terms like \"先買後付.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best translation would combine the strengths of the fifth and sixth translations, using \"Pay Later\" for \"先買後付,\" \"launched\" for \"啟用,\" and \"was also activated this year\" to reflect the completion within the year.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further introduced consumer protection measures concerning \"Pay Later\" products and new payment arrangements for property refinancing. In addition, the HKMA is collaborating with other regulatory authorities to establish a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issuing guidelines on investment products distribution, and launching a new regulatory regime for trust business. The \"Credit Reference Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies\" (MCRAs) model for consumer credit data was also activated this year.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"AML\/CFT,\" \"AML,\" \"AML Regtech Lab\/Labs,\" and \"Suptech.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology related to financial regulation and compliance.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"fraud\" instead of \"fraud cases\" or \"scams,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"the ‘AML Regtech Lab’ series\" which is grammatically correct but could be more concise.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less concise. It also uses \"suptech\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"AML operations\" instead of \"AML work,\" which is slightly less natural in this context. It also omits the parenthetical explanation for \"AML\/CFT.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"scams\" instead of \"fraud cases,\" which is acceptable but less formal. It also uses \"AML Regtech Labs\" with an \"s\" at the end, which is an alternative from the dictionary but may not be the most commonly used term.\n- **Translation 5** is concise and uses \"AML\/CFT ecosystem\" without the full explanation, which is acceptable. It also uses \"Suptech\" with a capital \"S,\" which is correct.\n- **Translation 6** is well-structured and uses \"AML Regtech Labs series\" with an \"s,\" which is an alternative from the dictionary. However, it uses \"for AML work\" instead of \"in AML work,\" which is slightly less natural.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity.\n- Use \"AML\/CFT\" with the parenthetical explanation \"(anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism)\" for clarity.\n- Use \"AML Regtech Lab\" without the \"s\" as it is the most direct match from the dictionary.\n- Use \"Suptech\" with a capital \"S\" for consistency.\n- Use \"fraud cases\" for precision.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent sentence structure.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English usage.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) ecosystem and strengthen responses to fraud cases. It also further promotes the application of data and technology through the \"AML Regtech Lab\" series, and accelerates the HKMA’s adoption of Suptech in AML work.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and verb tense. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"capital adequacy,\" \"disclosure standards,\" \"international supervisory standards,\" and \"practitioners.\" The only variation lies in the choice of words for \"banking industry\/sector\" and the verb tenses used in the second sentence.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"banking sector\" and \"is also working,\" which is grammatically correct and natural.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"banking industry\" and \"has also worked together,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"banking industry\" and \"also works,\" which is grammatically correct but less precise in conveying ongoing effort.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"banking industry\" and \"is also working with... to strive to build,\" which is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"banking industry\" and \"has also worked,\" which is similar to Translation 2.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"banking sector\" and \"is also working,\" which is consistent with Translation 1.\nThe phrase \"for future development\" appears in all translations except Translation 3, which omits it. However, the original Chinese text includes \"為未來發展努力,\" which clearly implies the purpose of the effort is for future development, so including this phrase is appropriate.\nThe best translation would retain the natural flow of the first translation, use \"banking sector\" (as it is more commonly used in regulatory contexts), and maintain the present continuous tense (\"is also working\") to reflect ongoing efforts.\n---\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards, locally. The HKMA is also working with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance the skills of practitioners for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources across all domestic systemically important banks, marking an important milestone in the development of the resolution regime.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing the success of the summit and its positive impact on Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The junior translators have all correctly used the term \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" as required by the dictionary. However, there are minor differences in verb choice and phrasing that affect fluency and tone.\n**Review of Translations:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"reinforcing\" and \"creating a positive ripple effect.\" This is fluent and natural, with appropriate verb tenses and prepositions.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"consolidated\" instead of \"reinforcing\" or \"solidifying,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less idiomatic in this context.\n- **Translation 3** mirrors Translation 2 but uses \"achieved success\" instead of \"was a success,\" which is slightly more formal and fits the tone of the original.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"consolidating\" and \"creating positive ripple effects.\" The use of \"effects\" (plural) is slightly off compared to the singular \"effect\" in the original, which is more idiomatic in this context.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"solidifying\" and \"creating a positive ripple effect.\" \"Solidifying\" is a strong and appropriate verb, and the rest of the sentence is well-structured.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"reinforcing\" and \"generating positive ripple effects.\" Again, \"effects\" is plural, which is less idiomatic than \"effect.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original while ensuring natural English phrasing. \"Reinforcing\" and \"solidifying\" are both strong verbs, but \"reinforcing\" is slightly more commonly used in this context. \"Creating a positive ripple effect\" is more idiomatic than \"generating positive ripple effects\" or \"creating positive ripple effects.\" The use of \"was a success\" is more concise and natural than \"achieved success\" or \"was successful.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was a success, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international financial center and creating a positive ripple effect.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with minor variations in phrasing and terminology. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Swap Connect,\" \"Dual Counter Market Making regime,\" and \"CMU.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, clarity, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and professional result.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms.\n- The structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all versions.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"within the year\" or \"during the year,\" which are both acceptable, but \"this year\" may be more direct and natural in this context.\n- The term \"central securities depository\" is used consistently, but \"platform\" is sometimes added unnecessarily (e.g., \"central securities depository platform\").\n- Some translations use \"Asia-Pacific region\" or \"Asia region,\" which are acceptable, but \"Asia\" alone is more concise and aligns with the original text.\n- The use of \"it is striving to develop\" or \"it has been striving to develop\" is slightly passive and could be more direct.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"this year\" instead of \"within the year\" or \"during the year\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Avoid adding unnecessary words like \"platform\" after \"central securities depository.\"\n- Use \"Asia\" rather than \"Asia-Pacific region\" or \"Asia region\" for consistency with the original text.\n- Use more active voice where appropriate, such as \"is working to develop\" instead of \"is striving to develop.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and natural phrasing from the junior translations, with minor refinements for clarity and conciseness.\nThe People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) optimized their Currency Swap Agreement this year, further solidifying Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore renminbi business hub. The HKMA is also working with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of Swap Connect and to introduce the Dual Counter Market Making regime to support the trading of renminbi-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. It is also working to develop the Central Moneymarkets Unit into a major international central securities depository in Asia.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and Green and Sustainable Finance.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Fintech 2025,\" \"financial sector,\" \"fintech hub,\" \"Faster Payment System (FPS),\" and \"enhanced functionalities.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"has seen steady growth in usage\" is a natural and commonly used expression in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"the financial sector\" with \"by\" or \"within,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than \"within the financial sector\" or \"by the financial sector.\"\n- The phrase \"with enhanced functionalities\" in some translations is slightly awkward compared to \"as its functionalities are enhanced\" or \"with enhanced functionalities.\"\n- The use of \"is seeing\" in one translation is less formal than \"has seen,\" which may not match the tone of the original text.\n- The placement of \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" varies slightly, with some translations using it in parentheses and others using it directly after the name.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"within the financial sector\" for consistency and naturalness.\n- Use \"as its functionalities are enhanced\" to maintain parallel structure with the first part of the sentence.\n- Ensure that \"Fintech 2025\" is consistently capitalized and enclosed in quotation marks.\n- Use \"has seen\" rather than \"is seeing\" for a more formal and completed tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy to promote the adoption of financial technology within the financial sector and enhance Hong Kong's position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System (FPS), with enhanced functionalities, has seen steady growth in usage.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, with the goal of enhancing public understanding of its policies and work.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, it uses \"enhancing\" as a participle, which is acceptable but slightly less formal than using a full clause.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very similar to the first but uses a full clause (\"to enhance the public's understanding\"), which improves fluency and formality. It also uses \"its\" to refer to the HKMA, which is appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in full, which is more formal and appropriate in official contexts. It also uses \"operations\" instead of \"work,\" which is a slight variation but still accurate. However, the use of \"the HKMA's\" is inconsistent with the full name used earlier.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second, with the same strengths in clarity and formality. It uses \"its\" consistently and is grammatically sound.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"the public\" instead of \"society,\" which is a slight deviation from the original. While not incorrect, it changes the nuance slightly. It also uses \"the HKMA’s\" consistently, which is good.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"the community\" instead of \"society,\" which is another slight deviation. It also uses \"its\" consistently and is grammatically sound.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality, especially in an official context. It should also maintain consistency in pronoun usage and avoid slight deviations in terms like \"society\" or \"community.\" The use of a full clause (\"to enhance the public's understanding\") is preferable for formality and clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with society and the market through various channels to enhance the public's understanding of its policies and work.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has carefully established a workforce emphasizing flexibility and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

Monetary Stability\n\n# May 26th\n\nThe original sentence is a formal financial statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent. However, there are minor differences in structure and word choice that affect clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Institutional Bond Issuance Programme,\" \"20-year Hong Kong Dollar Government Bonds,\" \"debut issuance,\" and \"HKD.\"\n- The use of \"bidding process\" or \"tender process\" is appropriate and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The placement of \"HKD 500 million\" is consistent across translations, though some use \"500 million HKD,\" which is also acceptable.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The placement of \"through a tender process\" or \"through a bidding process\" varies slightly, but both are correct. However, \"tender process\" is more formal and commonly used in official financial contexts.\n- The use of quotation marks around \"Institutional Bond Issuance Programme\" is inconsistent. While not incorrect, it is more formal to omit them unless the name is a direct quote or title.\n- The phrase \"as a debut issuance\" in the third translation is slightly awkward and less formal than \"debut issuance.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"tender process\" instead of \"bidding process\" for consistency with formal financial terminology.\n- Omit quotation marks around \"Institutional Bond Issuance Programme\" unless it is a direct title.\n- Ensure that the structure flows naturally, with \"debut issuance\" placed directly after the amount and type of bonds.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe government conducted a debut issuance of HKD 500 million in 20-year Hong Kong Dollar Government Bonds through a tender process under the Institutional Bond Issuance Programme.\nThe government conducted a debut issuance of HKD 500 million in 20-year Hong Kong Dollar Government Bonds through a tender process under the Institutional Bond Issuance Programme.\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the optimization of their Currency Swap Agreement, converting it into a standing arrangement that no longer requires renewal. The agreement’s scale has been expanded from the original 500 billion RMB\/590 billion HKD to 800 billion RMB\/940 billion HKD.\n\n# July 13th\n# 7月13日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headlines or titles. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate, though there are minor differences in formatting.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"July 13th\"** – This is correct and natural in English, using the ordinal form \"13th\" which is standard in English date formats.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# July 13th\"** – This includes a hashtag, which may be appropriate in certain contexts (e.g., social media), but it is not clear why it was added here. The original text does not include a hashtag, so this may be an unnecessary addition.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"July 13th\"** – This is identical to the first translation and is correct.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"July 13th\"** – Same as above.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"July 13\"** – This is also correct, though it omits the ordinal \"th.\" While this is acceptable in some informal contexts, the ordinal form is more standard in formal writing.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# July 13\"** – Again, the hashtag is unnecessary, and the ordinal \"13th\" is omitted, making it less formal than the other translations.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe original text is a simple date, and the most natural and standard English translation would be \"July 13th.\" This format is widely used in formal and informal contexts and aligns with standard English conventions. The use of a hashtag is not supported by the original text and should be omitted. The ordinal \"th\" is preferred over the cardinal \"13\" in most written English contexts.\n**Final Translation:**\nJuly 13th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Statement of Commitment,\" \"Foreign Exchange Global Code,\" and \"market participants.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the message of reaffirming commitment to the updated code is clearly conveyed.\n- The use of \"reaffirming its commitment\" is appropriate and commonly used in formal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Prepositions:** Some translations use \"issued an updated Statement of Commitment regarding the Foreign Exchange Global Code,\" while others use \"to the Foreign Exchange Global Code.\" The preposition \"to\" is more natural in this context, as the statement is directed toward the code.\n- **Pluralization of \"market participants\":** Some translations use the singular \"market participant,\" which is less accurate since the original refers to \"市場參與者\" in plural.\n- **Verb Choice:** \"Adhere to,\" \"comply with,\" and \"abide by\" are all acceptable, but \"adhere to\" is slightly more formal and precise in the context of regulatory commitments.\n- **Tense:** One translation uses \"has issued,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the simple past tense \"issued.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"to the Foreign Exchange Global Code\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Use the plural \"market participants\" to match the original.\n- Use \"adhere to\" for its formal and precise connotation in regulatory contexts.\n- Use the simple past tense \"issued\" for directness and clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued an updated Statement of Commitment to the Foreign Exchange Global Code, reaffirming its commitment to adhere to the updated version of the Code when acting as market participants in the foreign exchange market.\n\n# July 22\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting an official announcement. The key terms \"金管局\" and \"人民幣流動資金安排\" must be translated exactly as per the dictionary: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Renminbi Liquidity Facility,\" respectively.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (full name), which is appropriate for formal contexts. The verb \"announced\" is correct and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Expanding the scale\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"expanding its scale\" or \"expanding the scale of the facility.\"  \n   - **Score:** Good, but could be more precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" (short form), which is acceptable in formal contexts. The phrasing \"expanded scale\" is concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Expanded scale\" is a noun phrase, which is less common in such announcements. \"Expanding the scale\" is more active and natural.  \n   - **Score:** Acceptable, but slightly less fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the active voice \"expanding its scale,\" which is natural and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.  \n   - **Score:** Very good.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"enhancement\" instead of \"optimization,\" which is a valid synonym.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Enhancement\" may not be as precise as \"optimization\" in the context of financial policy. Also, \"expanding its scale\" is correct, but \"streamlining operations\" is slightly more formal than \"simplifying operations.\"  \n   - **Score:** Good, but slightly less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"enhancements\" and \"streamlining operations,\" which are both natural and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Enhancements\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"optimization.\"  \n   - **Score:** Good, but slightly less precise than \"optimization.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"optimization,\" which are accurate. The phrasing \"expanding the scale\" is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Expanding the scale\" is slightly less precise than \"expanding its scale.\"  \n   - **Score:** Good, but could be more precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for formality, the term \"optimization\" to match the original, and the active voice \"expanding its scale\" and \"simplifying operations\" for clarity and naturalness. The third and sixth translations are the closest, but the third one is slightly more precise in its phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the optimization of the Renminbi Liquidity Facility, including expanding its scale and simplifying operations.\n\n# Banking System\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 銀行體系\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation \"Banking System\" with minor differences in capitalization and the presence of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify \"銀行體系\" as \"Banking System,\" which is an accurate and commonly used translation.\n- The translations are concise and appropriate for a heading.\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of the \"#\" symbol in some translations (e.g., \"# Banking system\") is unnecessary unless the original text is intended to be a heading or section title in a document. Since the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it should be retained in the translation if it serves a formatting purpose.\n- Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., \"banking system\" vs. \"Banking System\") may affect the visual consistency of the heading, especially in formal or professional documents.\nImprovements:\n- Retain the \"#\" symbol to match the original formatting.\n- Use consistent capitalization, such as \"Banking System,\" to maintain a professional appearance.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n# Banking System\n\n# January 28\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding regulatory guidance issued by two Hong Kong financial authorities. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and word choice. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" as per the dictionary, and the structure is natural. The phrase \"providing updated guidance to intermediaries engaging in virtual asset-related activities to protect clients\" is clear and concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is nearly identical to the first, except it uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" instead of \"HKMA.\" While both are acceptable, \"HKMA\" is more concise and commonly used in official contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Identical to the second, so the same comments apply.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is also accurate but uses \"customers\" instead of \"clients.\" While both terms are acceptable, \"clients\" is more commonly used in financial regulatory contexts. The phrase \"intermediaries' activities related to virtual assets\" is slightly less direct than \"intermediaries engaging in virtual asset-related activities.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"joint letter\" instead of \"joint circular.\" \"Circular\" is the more appropriate term in this context, as it refers to an official communication from a regulatory body. Also, \"customers\" is used instead of \"clients.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" correctly, and the structure is natural. However, it uses \"clients\" consistently, which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best version should use \"HKMA\" and \"SFC\" for brevity and consistency with official terminology. It should use \"clients\" rather than \"customers\" to align with financial regulatory language. The phrase \"providing updated guidance to intermediaries engaging in virtual asset-related activities to protect clients\" is the most natural and precise.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a joint circular providing updated guidance to intermediaries engaging in virtual asset-related activities to protect clients.\n\n# January 28\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) updating its supervisory guidance concerning money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks related to banks managing virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, which must be used exactly.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"supervisory guidance.\" The structure is clear and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"banks managing virtual assets\" may be misinterpreted as banks that are managing virtual assets, rather than banks that are managing risks related to virtual assets. The placement of \"related to\" could be improved for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"supervisory guidance\" correctly. The sentence is concise and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"related to banks managing virtual assets\" is ambiguous and could be misread as banks managing virtual assets, not banks managing risks related to virtual assets.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"supervisory guidance\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"bank management of money laundering\" is incorrect in context. The original text refers to risks related to bank management, not the management of ML\/TF itself.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"supervisory guidance\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"banking management\" is vague and not a direct translation of the original. Also, \"ML\/TF\" is used instead of the full terms, which may be less formal than required.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"supervisory guidance\" and \"virtual asset service providers\" correctly. The sentence is clear and grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less concise. Also, the phrase \"management of money laundering\" is slightly off in meaning.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"supervisory guidance\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"ML\/TF\" instead of the full terms, which may be less appropriate in a formal context. Also, the phrase \"banking management\" is vague and not a direct translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency.\n- Use the full terms \"money laundering\" and \"terrorist financing\" for clarity and formality.\n- Accurately reflect that the guidance is about risks related to **bank management** of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.\n- Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has updated its supervisory guidance on money laundering and terrorist financing risks related to the management of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.\n\n# February 8\n\nThe original sentence, \"金管局宣布延長「銀行業人才起動計劃」6個月。\" translates to \"The HKMA announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme for six months.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this sentence, each with slight differences in phrasing and structure.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The HKMA announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme for six months.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and fluent. Uses \"for six months\" which is natural in English.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None notable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The HKMA announced an extension of the Banking Talent Programme by six months.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"by six months\" is also acceptable, though slightly less common than \"for six months.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less idiomatic than \"for six months.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme for six months.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" which is appropriate in formal contexts.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than \"HKMA,\" which is commonly used in official announcements.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The HKMA announced a six-month extension of the Banking Talent Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and natural. \"Six-month extension\" is a common phrasing.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less explicit about the action of extending, though still clear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"HKMA announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme for six months.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct and concise.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Omission of the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" is a minor grammatical issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"HKMA announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme by six months.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct in terms of content.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the second translation, \"by six months\" is less idiomatic than \"for six months.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use natural English phrasing. \"For six months\" is more idiomatic than \"by six months\" in this context. The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate and commonly used in official contexts. Including the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" is also grammatically correct and adds formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the extension of the Banking Talent Programme for six months.\n\n# February 23\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC), through its wholly-owned subsidiary HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI), announced that the Mortgage Insurance Programme has been revised and expanded to apply to completed residential properties.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe original text announces an optimization of the \"百分百擔保個人特惠貸款計劃\" (Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme, PLGS) and an extension of the application period. The junior translators have all correctly used the term \"Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme\" or its acronym \"PLGS\" from the dictionary. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and prepositions that affect fluency and precision.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the term \"Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme\" or \"PLGS.\"\n- Accurate dates and time references.\n- Proper structure of the sentence.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Use of \"enhanced measures\" vs. \"optimized measures\" – both are acceptable, but \"optimized\" is more precise in the context of improving a system or process.\n- Use of \"until\" vs. \"to\" – \"to\" is more natural in this context when referring to a specific endpoint.\n- The use of \"the\" before \"application period\" – while not grammatically incorrect, it is more concise to omit it for clarity and fluency.\nThe best translation would use \"optimized measures,\" \"to the end of April 2023,\" and avoid unnecessary articles for conciseness.\nThe Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme (PLGS) has introduced optimized measures (effective April 19) and extended the application period to the end of April 2023.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and \"partial principal repayment arrangement\" correctly. It also uses \"HKMA\" as the preferred term. However, it omits the word \"not\" in \"還息不還本,\" which is slightly inaccurate.\n2. **Translation 2** is very accurate, using \"pre-approved interest-only repayment without principal repayment\" to capture the nuance of \"還息不還本.\" It also uses the correct dictionary terms and is fluent. However, it uses \"program\" instead of \"scheme,\" which is slightly less formal than the original.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"principal and interest repayment moratorium,\" which is not an exact match for \"預先批核還息不還本.\" It also uses \"moratorium,\" which may imply a legal or temporary suspension, not the intended financial relief. This is a significant deviation from the original.\n4. **Translation 4** is accurate and fluent, using \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and \"partial principal repayment arrangement\" correctly. It also uses \"HKMA\" and \"plan\" instead of \"scheme,\" which is acceptable. However, it uses \"October 31\" instead of \"the end of October,\" which is slightly less natural.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"Pre-approved Principal Repayment Deferral,\" which is not an exact match for \"預先批核還息不還本.\" It also uses \"return to normal repayment\" instead of \"resume normal repayments,\" which is slightly less idiomatic.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"interest-only repayment\" without the \"pre-approved\" part, which is a deviation from the original. It also uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" instead of just \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less concise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The term \"預先批核還息不還本\" should be translated as \"pre-approved interest-only repayment without principal repayment\" to capture the full nuance.\n- \"HKMA\" is the preferred term over the full name.\n- \"Trade loans\" should be used as per the dictionary.\n- \"Partial principal repayment arrangement\" is the correct term.\n- The phrase \"gradually resume normal repayments\" is more idiomatic than \"return to normal repayment.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while ensuring full fidelity to the original text and dictionary terms.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment without principal repayment\" scheme for another six months until the end of October. The principal repayment period for trade loans can also be extended by 90 days. The scheme also provides a one-year partial principal repayment arrangement, allowing borrowers who are willing and able to gradually resume normal repayments.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has introduced optimization measures effective April 1 and extended the application period to June 30, 2023. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, tense, and prepositions that affect fluency and clarity.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"SFGS\" and \"effective April 1st\" — the abbreviation is acceptable if the reader is familiar with it, but \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" is more descriptive. \"April 1st\" is slightly less formal than \"April 1.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses the full name and \"optimized measures\" — this is accurate and natural. \"Until\" is appropriate for the application period.\n- **Translation 3** is similar to 2 but uses \"introduced\" instead of \"introduced optimized measures\" — the structure is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 4** uses the full name and \"has been extended\" — the passive voice is acceptable but slightly less direct than the active voice used in other translations.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"enhanced measures\" instead of \"optimized\" — while \"enhanced\" is a valid synonym, \"optimized\" is more precise in the context of policy improvements.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to 2, using \"optimized measures\" and \"until\" — it is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full name \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" for clarity, as it is the more formal and descriptive version. \"Optimized measures\" is more precise than \"enhanced\" in this context. The phrase \"effective April 1\" is more concise and natural than \"effective April 1st.\" The preposition \"until\" is appropriate for the application period. The active voice (\"has introduced\") is more direct and engaging than the passive voice (\"has been extended\").\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has also introduced optimized measures (effective April 1) and extended the application period until June 30, 2023.\n\n# April 1st\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a regulatory announcement. The key terms—金管局 (HKMA), 保險業監管局（保監局） (IA), and 保費融資 (premium financing)—must be translated precisely as per the dictionary. The sentence structure in Chinese is straightforward, and the English translation should reflect this clarity and formality.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Insurance Authority\" and \"enhance customer protection by using premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\" This is grammatically correct and fluent, but \"by using\" may imply that the customers are using premium financing, which is not the intended meaning. The regulators are implementing measures regarding the use of premium financing.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA)\" and \"enhance customer protection regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\" This is accurate and clear, with appropriate use of parentheses for acronyms. The phrase \"regarding the use of\" correctly conveys that the measures are about the use of premium financing.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA and IA\" and \"regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\" While concise, it lacks the full names of the organizations, which may be less formal and less suitable for a regulatory context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"The HKMA and the Insurance Authority have launched measures to strengthen customer protection regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\" This is very close to the best version, with \"launched\" being a slightly more dynamic verb than \"introduced,\" and \"strengthen\" is a good synonym for \"enhance.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"the investment of premium financing in life insurance policies.\" This misrepresents the term 保費融資, which refers to financing the payment of premiums, not investing in policies. This is a critical error in meaning.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"by promoting the use of premium financing for purchasing life insurance policies.\" This implies that the regulators are encouraging the use of premium financing, which is not the case. The regulators are implementing measures *regarding* the use of premium financing, not promoting it.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full names of the organizations with their acronyms in parentheses.\n- Use \"introduced\" or \"launched\" as appropriate verbs.\n- Use \"regarding the use of\" to accurately reflect the regulatory focus.\n- Avoid misinterpretation of terms like 保費融資.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) have introduced measures to enhance customer protection regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\n\n# April 14th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 4月14日,\" where \"#\" is likely used as a heading or marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date \"April 14th\" or \"April 14,\" with or without the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the translations:\n- All translations correctly identify the date as \"April 14th\" or \"April 14,\" which is accurate.\n- The use of \"April 14th\" is more standard in English for dates, especially in formal or written contexts.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations (e.g., \"# April 14th\") is consistent with the original format, which may be important for maintaining the structure or context of the text.\n- However, the use of \"April 14\" without the \"th\" is less common in formal writing and may appear less polished.\nReasoning for improvement:\n- The most natural and standard English format for the date would be \"April 14th,\" as it includes the ordinal suffix.\n- Maintaining the \"#\" symbol is appropriate if it serves a structural or contextual role in the original text.\n- The best translation should be concise, accurate, and stylistically appropriate for English usage.\nImproved translation:\n# April 14th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and formality that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for 金管局, and \"Mainland bank accounts\" for 內地銀行帳戶.\n- Accurate translation of the main action: issuing guidelines or guidance to Hong Kong banks.\n- Proper handling of the context: the pandemic, quarantine restrictions, and the goal of reactivating bank accounts.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- **\"Guidelines\" vs. \"Guidance\"**: While both are acceptable, \"guidelines\" is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts, making it more appropriate for an authority like the HKMA.\n- **\"Residents\" vs. \"Citizens\"**: \"Residents\" is more inclusive and commonly used in official contexts, especially when referring to people living in Hong Kong, which includes both citizens and non-citizens.\n- **\"Reactivating\" vs. \"Restarting\"**: \"Reactivating\" is more precise in a financial context, as it refers to the process of reactivating dormant accounts.\n- **\"Epidemic\" vs. \"Pandemic\"**: \"Pandemic\" is more accurate in this context, as it refers to a global outbreak, which aligns with the scale of the situation caused by the coronavirus.\n- **\"Imposed\" vs. \"Implemented\"**: \"Implemented\" is more neutral and commonly used in official statements, whereas \"imposed\" may carry a slightly more negative connotation.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"guidelines,\" \"residents,\" \"reactivating,\" and \"pandemic,\" with a neutral and formal tone.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidelines to Hong Kong banks on assisting Hong Kong residents in reactivating their Mainland bank accounts under quarantine restrictions implemented due to the pandemic.\n\n# April 26\n# 4月26日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, where the \"#\" symbol is often used to denote a heading or section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the main differences being the use of \"April 26\" versus \"April 26th\" and the inclusion or exclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in translating the date itself, with all versions correctly rendering \"4月26日\" as \"April 26\" or \"April 26th.\" However, there are some nuances to consider:\n- **\"April 26\" vs. \"April 26th\":** In English, both forms are acceptable, but \"April 26\" is more commonly used in formal or written contexts, especially when the date is part of a heading or title. \"April 26th\" is more conversational and is often used in spoken English or informal writing.\n  \n- **Use of the \"#\" symbol:** In the original text, the \"#\" symbol is used to denote a heading or section. In English, this is often retained in digital or structured formats (e.g., in markdown or web content), but in traditional written English, it may be omitted unless the format specifically requires it.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol if it is part of the intended formatting, and to use \"April 26\" as the standard written form of the date.\nThus, the most appropriate translation is:\n# April 26\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching a platform called the \"合規科技資訊平台\" (Regtech Knowledge Hub) to encourage the local Regtech ecosystem to enhance experience and specialized knowledge in applying Regtech. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have used these to varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. However, \"enhance experience and specialized knowledge in applying Regtech\" is slightly awkward and lacks the nuance of \"exchange\" found in the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. The phrase \"enhance experience and knowledge exchange in the application of Regtech\" is more fluent and captures the idea of exchange, though \"compliance tech\" is not the preferred term from the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. The phrase \"enhance the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in applying regulatory technology\" is accurate but slightly wordy and less concise than some alternatives.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. The phrase \"strengthen the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in applying regulatory technology\" is fluent and captures the original intent well.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. The phrase \"strengthen the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in the application of Regtech\" is fluent and accurate, though \"application of Regtech\" is slightly less natural than \"applying Regtech.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" and \"Regtech\" correctly. However, it uses \"regulatory technology\" instead of \"Regtech\" for \"合規科技,\" which is not the preferred term from the dictionary. Also, \"enhance the exchange\" is slightly less dynamic than \"strengthen the exchange.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Regtech\" consistently for \"合規科技\" as per the dictionary, use \"Regtech Knowledge Hub\" for the platform, and convey the idea of \"strengthening the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in applying Regtech\" in a natural and fluent manner. The fourth and fifth translations are the most accurate and fluent, with the fourth being slightly more dynamic due to the use of \"strengthen.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has launched the “Regtech Knowledge Hub” to encourage the Hong Kong Regtech ecosystem to strengthen the exchange of experience and specialized knowledge in applying Regtech.\n\n# April 28th\n\nThe original text is concise and informative, announcing a joint initiative between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the banking industry to expand the talent pool in rapidly growing areas of the banking sector through the \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme.\" The dictionary provides exact translations for \"金管局\" and \"銀行業畢業生培訓計劃,\" which must be used as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is grammatically sound and fluent. However, \"the industry’s rapidly growing areas\" is slightly awkward compared to \"the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is well-structured and natural. The phrase \"aiming to expand the talent pool in the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector\" is clear and appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is fluent and well-structured. The phrase \"the sector's rapidly growing areas\" is slightly less formal than \"the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is grammatically correct but slightly less formal. \"For the rapidly growing areas in the banking sector\" is acceptable but not as precise as \"in the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is fluent and natural. The structure \"to expand the talent pool for the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector\" is slightly less precise than \"in the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" correctly. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent. The phrase \"in rapidly growing areas of the banking sector\" is concise and appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and formality, include the exact term \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" in quotes, and use the most natural and precise phrasing. The phrase \"to expand the talent pool in the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector\" is the most natural and precise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the joint launch of the \"Banking Graduate Trainee Programme\" with the banking industry to expand the talent pool in the rapidly growing areas of the banking sector.\n\n# May 5th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB),\" \"DTC Association,\" \"Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme,\" and \"rolling bad apples.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the main idea being that the HKMA has approved the implementation of the scheme by the two associations to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon in the banking industry.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** The first translation uses \"acknowledged,\" which is less precise than \"approved\" or \"recognized\" in this context. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth translations use \"approved,\" which is more appropriate for regulatory bodies like the HKMA.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** The first and sixth translations use different quotation marks (straight vs. curly), which is a minor but unnecessary inconsistency. The rest use consistent quotation marks.\n- **Prepositional Phrases:** The first translation uses \"aimed at addressing,\" while others use \"aimed at addressing\" or \"which aims to address.\" The latter is more natural in formal writing.\n- **Word Choice:** The sixth translation uses \"issue\" instead of \"phenomenon,\" which is slightly less precise in this context. \"Phenomenon\" better captures the idea of a recurring or systemic issue.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The fifth and sixth translations are slightly more fluent and natural in tone, with smoother phrasing such as \"within the Hong Kong banking sector\" and \"which aims to address.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"approved\" as the verb, as it is the most accurate and commonly used term in regulatory contexts.\n- Maintain consistent quotation marks (curly) for the scheme and phenomenon.\n- Use \"aiming to address\" or \"which aims to address\" for smoother flow.\n- Use \"phenomenon\" rather than \"issue\" to preserve the nuance of the original term.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary prepositions or wordiness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has approved the “Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme” to be implemented by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) and the DTC Association, aiming to address the phenomenon of “rolling bad apples” in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\n# May 6th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the \"百分百擔保個人特惠貸款計劃\" (Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme) is now accepting applications from individual property owners affected by the \"暫緩追討欠租安排\" (rental enforcement moratorium) until October 31.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"landlords\" and \"until October 31.\" The term \"landlords\" is acceptable, but \"property owners\" may be more inclusive. The use of \"until\" is correct.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"property owners\" and \"until October 31.\" This is accurate and inclusive. The use of quotation marks around \"Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme\" is appropriate for the first mention.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"landlords\" and \"until October 31st.\" The use of \"31st\" is slightly more formal and less common in official announcements. The verb \"has begun\" is slightly less direct than \"begins.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"property owners\" and \"until October 31.\" The use of \"has started\" is slightly less direct than \"begins\" or \"commences.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"owners\" without specifying \"property,\" which may be ambiguous. \"Until October 31\" is correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"property owners\" and \"until October 31.\" The verb \"commences\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"begins\" or \"starts.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"property owners\" is more inclusive and accurate than \"landlords,\" as it encompasses all types of property owners, not just those who rent out properties.\n- The phrase \"begins accepting\" is more direct and aligns with the original sentence's tone.\n- The date format \"October 31\" is standard and preferred over \"October 31st\" in formal writing.\n- The use of quotation marks around the scheme name is appropriate for the first mention.\n- The verb \"begins\" is more active and precise than \"has begun\" or \"has started.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"Personal Loan Guarantee Scheme\" begins accepting applications from individual property owners affected by the rental enforcement moratorium until October 31.\n\n# May 25th\n\nThe original text is concise and formal, reflecting an official statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The key elements to translate accurately are the title of the report and the term \"穩善文化,\" which must be rendered as \"sound culture\" per the dictionary. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and grammatical precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"sound culture.\"\n- The title of the report is consistently translated as \"Report of the Focused Review on Incentive Systems of Front Offices in Retail Banks.\"\n- The use of \"continue promoting\" or \"continuously promote\" effectively conveys the ongoing nature of the initiative.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"released\" and \"within the banking industry,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"in the banking industry.\"\n- The second translation uses \"has released\" and \"continuously promote,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more complex than necessary for a concise statement.\n- The third translation uses \"published the English version of the Report,\" which is redundant since the report is already presented in English.\n- The fourth and fifth translations are concise and grammatically sound, using \"published\" and \"released\" appropriately.\n- The sixth translation is similar to the fourth but uses \"the English version of the Report,\" which is redundant.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"published\" or \"released\" consistently, depending on the tone desired.\n- Avoid redundancy by omitting \"the English version of the Report\" since the report is already presented in English.\n- Use \"in the banking industry\" for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure the verb tense aligns with the original intent of the statement.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the Report of the Focused Review on Incentive Systems of Front Offices in Retail Banks (English version) to continue promoting a sound culture in the banking industry.\n\n# May 27th\n\nThe original text states that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued the Code of Practice for Trust Business and a new section of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) to strengthen the regulation and supervision of trust business in Hong Kong.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and the exact titles from the dictionary. The use of \"has issued a new section\" is appropriate and natural. The verb \"to strengthen\" is suitable, though \"enhance\" might be slightly more formal.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"issued the 'Code of Practice for Trust Business' and the related 'Supervisory Policy Manual' new section\" is awkward and unclear. The placement of \"new section\" is confusing and disrupts the sentence structure.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is mostly correct but slightly awkward. The phrase \"the new section of the related Supervisory Policy Manual\" is grammatically correct but could be more concise. The use of \"strengthen\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"has issued a new section\" and \"enhance\" as alternatives, both of which are acceptable. The structure is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is mostly correct but uses \"module\" instead of \"section,\" which is not one of the dictionary alternatives. \"Module\" is not an exact match for the term in the original text. Additionally, \"SPM\" is used without explanation, which may be less clear for some readers.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" and the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity. The phrase \"a new section of the Supervisory Policy Manual\" is correct and natural. The use of \"enhance\" is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact terms from the dictionary, maintain grammatical correctness, and ensure fluency and clarity. The first and sixth translations are both strong, but the sixth provides the full name of HKMA for clarity, which is especially useful in formal or official contexts. It also uses \"enhance\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still accurate. The structure is clear and natural, and all dictionary terms are used correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued the Code of Practice for Trust Business and a new section of the Supervisory Policy Manual to enhance the regulation and supervision of trust business in Hong Kong.\n\n# May 31st\n\nHKMC Annuity Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mortgage Securities Company, announced that the HKMC Annuity Plan has introduced optimized measures and promotional offers. The optimized measures include increasing the upper limit for \"Special Withdrawal for Medical and Dental Expenses\" and the upper limit for total individual premium amounts.\n\n# June 23\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of an official announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in tense, prepositions, and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as the official name of the institution.\n- The term \"Tech Baseline Assessment\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry.\n- The phrase \"related work plan(s)\" is accurately translated, with only minor differences in pluralization.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense:** Some translations use the simple past (\"released\"), while others use the present perfect (\"has released\"). The original text uses the present tense (\"發布\"), which implies a current or recent action. The present perfect (\"has released\") is more appropriate in this context.\n- **Prepositions:** The phrase \"support the industry's application of fintech\" is slightly more natural than \"support the industry in applying financial technology,\" though both are grammatically correct.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Fintech\" is more concise and commonly used in modern English than \"financial technology,\" especially in the context of regulatory or industry announcements.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the present perfect tense (\"has released\") to reflect the recentness of the action.\n- Use \"fintech\" instead of \"financial technology\" for conciseness and modernity.\n- Ensure consistency in pluralization: \"work plan\" vs. \"work plans.\" The original text uses \"工作計劃\" (singular), so \"work plan\" is more accurate.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has released the results of the Tech Baseline Assessment and related work plan to further support the industry's application of fintech.\n\n# July 1st\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement regarding the implementation of a regulatory framework. The junior translators have all correctly used the dictionary terms: \"Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022\" and \"Basel Committee.\" However, there are differences in phrasing, verb tense, and prepositional usage that affect fluency and accuracy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate verbs such as \"came into effect,\" \"have come into effect,\" or \"have taken effect,\" which are all acceptable in legal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"formulated to implement\" which is slightly less common in legal English than \"enacted\" or \"introduced.\"\n- **Translation 3** has a subject-verb agreement error: \"Rules... has taken effect\" should be \"have taken effect.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"equity investments in funds by banks,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than \"banks' equity investments in funds.\"\n- **Translation 6** misrepresents the original by stating the rules \"came into effect to implement,\" which implies the rules were implemented to achieve the Basel Committee’s requirements, rather than that the rules were created to implement them. This changes the meaning slightly.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"enacted\" or \"introduced\" for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement.\n- Use \"banks' equity investments in funds\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Maintain the correct sequence: the rules were enacted to implement the Basel Committee’s requirements.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022, which were enacted to implement the Basel Committee's \"Capital Requirements for Banks' Equity Investments in Funds,\" have come into effect.\n\n# July 6–8\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"\n- The term \"regional crisis simulation exercise\" is consistently used for \"區域危機模擬演習.\"\n- \"Deposit insurers\" is correctly used for \"存款保險機構.\"\n- \"Supervisory and resolution authorities\" is accurately translated for \"監管和處置當局.\"\n- The general structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"central banking\" instead of \"central banks\" when referring to the institutions involved, which is incorrect based on the dictionary. \"Central banking\" is a function or activity, not an institution.\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"central banking institutions,\" which is not a standard term and misrepresents the dictionary entry \"central bank.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"central banks\" correctly but uses \"implementation\" instead of \"conducting\" or \"execution,\" which is slightly less precise than \"conducting\" in this context.\n- **Translation 4** repeats the same error as Translation 1 by using \"central banking\" instead of \"central banks.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"central banking institutions,\" which is again incorrect.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate, using \"central banks\" and \"conducting\" appropriately, but it could be slightly more fluent.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"central banks\" should be used for \"中央銀行\" as per the dictionary, not \"central banking\" or \"central banking institutions.\"\n- The verb \"conducting\" is more natural in this context than \"execution\" or \"implementation.\"\n- The phrase \"aiming to strengthen cross-border cooperation\" is slightly more concise and natural than \"with the aim of strengthening\" or \"aimed at strengthening.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA participated in designing and conducting a three-day regional crisis simulation exercise. The exercise involved 10 central banks, supervisory and resolution authorities, and deposit insurers from the Asia-Pacific region, aiming to strengthen cross-border cooperation.\n\n# July 8th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) provides guidance to authorized institutions regarding the sale of a specific type of insurance product—protection linked plans—to ensure customer protection.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA provides guidance to authorized institutions on the sale of protection linked plans to provide protection for customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"HKMA\" and \"authorized institutions,\" and correctly translates \"protection linked plan.\" The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"to provide protection for customers\" is slightly redundant, as the purpose of the guidance is already implied.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA provides guidance on the sale of protection linked plans by authorized institutions to offer customers protection.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"protection linked plans\" correctly. The sentence is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"by authorized institutions\" may be misinterpreted as the institutions themselves offering protection, rather than the guidance being about their sales practices.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance on the sale of protection linked plans by authorized institutions to offer customers protection.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the correct term \"protection linked plans.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue as the second translation regarding the placement of \"by authorized institutions.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance on the sale of protection linked plans by authorized institutions to protect customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the full name and correct terminology. The verb \"protect\" is more direct than \"offer protection.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue with \"by authorized institutions\" potentially misplacing the action.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has provided guidance to AIs on the sale of protection linked plan to provide protection for customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"AIs\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Protection linked plan\" is singular, but the original uses the plural \"plans.\" Also, \"has provided\" is slightly more formal than necessary for the context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has issued guidance on the sale of protection linked plans by AIs to provide protection for customers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"AIs\" correctly. The verb \"issued\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue with \"by AIs\" potentially misplacing the action.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct terms from the dictionary.\n- Be grammatically correct and fluent.\n- Avoid ambiguity in the relationship between the HKMA, the authorized institutions, and the customers.\n- Use natural English phrasing.\nThe first and sixth translations are the strongest, but the first is more concise and avoids the redundancy of \"to provide protection for customers.\" The sixth translation uses \"has issued\" which is slightly more formal than necessary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA provides guidance to authorized institutions on the sale of protection linked plans to ensure customer protection.\n\n# July 8th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and structure that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"stored value facility (SVF) licensees,\" and \"Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Report 2022.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of \"guidelines\" or \"guidance\" is appropriate, though \"guidelines\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and sixth translations use \"guidelines,\" while the others use \"guidance.\" While both are acceptable, \"guidelines\" is more precise in a regulatory context.\n- The sixth translation uses \"publication of the Hong Kong...\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"Hong Kong... Report 2022 published by the government.\"\n- The third translation uses \"key insights\" instead of \"key findings,\" which is slightly less precise in a formal report context.\n- The fifth translation uses \"the Government\" with a capital \"G,\" which is not standard in English unless referring to a specific government entity or in a formal title.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"guidelines\" for consistency with regulatory terminology.\n- Use \"the government's\" to maintain parallel structure and clarity.\n- Ensure that the title of the report is presented consistently without unnecessary prepositions or articles.\n- Maintain a formal and precise tone, as the original text is a regulatory document.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued guidelines to banks and stored value facility (SVF) licensees based on the key findings and related implications outlined in the Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Report 2022 published by the government.\n\n# July 20\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Banking Association\" as full names. It correctly uses \"additional payment arrangement for residential mortgage refinancing transactions\" and \"property transactions.\" However, it repeats \"payment arrangement\" unnecessarily.\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and uses the abbreviations \"HKMA\" and \"HKAB\" appropriately. It uses \"mortgage lenders\" instead of \"mortgage banks,\" which is slightly less precise but still acceptable. It also uses \"new property transaction payment arrangement,\" which is accurate.\n3. **Translation 3** correctly uses \"PAPT\" as per the dictionary, which is a key term. However, it uses \"PAPT\" without defining it, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the acronym. It also uses \"for customers to choose from,\" which is slightly wordy.\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 1 but repeats \"additional payment arrangement\" twice, which is redundant.\n5. **Translation 5** is more complex and slightly less fluent. It uses \"as an option for customers in relation to residential mortgage refinancing transactions,\" which is unnecessarily wordy. It also uses \"PAPT\" without explanation, which may be confusing.\n6. **Translation 6** is concise and uses \"PAPT\" correctly. It uses \"will begin providing this PAPT from November 7th,\" which is slightly less precise than \"began offering\" in the original text.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" and \"HKAB\" consistently as abbreviations, as they are standard in financial contexts.\n- Use \"PAPT\" as per the dictionary, but consider adding a brief explanation if the audience may not be familiar with the term.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"additional payment arrangement.\"\n- Ensure the verb tense matches the original text, which uses past tense (\"began offering\").\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be concise, use the correct abbreviations and terms, and maintain the original tense and clarity.\n**Final Translation:**\nHKMA welcomes the HKAB's announcement to provide an additional payment arrangement for residential mortgage refinancing transactions. Mortgage banks began offering this PAPT for property transactions on November 7.\n\n# July 21st\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese for marking dates, often seen in calendars, headlines, or event listings. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use \"July 21st,\" which is the standard ordinal format in English for dates. The second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"July 21\" without the \"st\" suffix. While both are acceptable, the inclusion of the ordinal suffix is more common in formal or written English, especially when the date is used in a title or heading.\nSince the original text includes a \"#\" symbol before the date, it is likely that this is part of a list or a heading format. In English, the \"#\" symbol is often used similarly, so retaining it in the translation is appropriate. However, the junior translators have not consistently included it in their translations. The second, fifth, and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, while the others do not.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the \"#\" symbol and use the ordinal format \"July 21st\" for consistency with formal English usage. This format is more widely recognized and preferred in written English, especially in contexts such as headlines, calendars, or lists.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"low-threshold and easy to implement\" which is natural, though \"low-threshold\" is slightly less common than \"lower barriers to entry\" in formal contexts.\n2. **Translation 2** is also accurate, but \"easier to implement and have lower thresholds\" is slightly awkward in structure, as it separates the two descriptors.\n3. **Translation 3** is concise and uses \"low-threshold and easily implementable,\" which is fluent and natural. However, \"easily implementable\" is slightly less common than \"easy to implement.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is well-written and uses \"lower barriers to entry and are easier to implement,\" which is a more formal and commonly used phrasing in professional contexts.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 4, but uses \"lower barriers and are easier to implement,\" which is slightly less precise than \"lower barriers to entry.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is grammatically correct but uses the present continuous tense (\"are co-hosting\") which may not be appropriate if the event has already occurred, as suggested by the original text.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"HKMA\" (the more commonly used acronym in official contexts).\n- \"數碼港\" is correctly translated as \"Cyberport.\"\n- \"反洗錢合規科技實驗室(AMLab 2)\" is correctly translated as \"Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regtech Lab (AMLab 2).\"\n- \"易用科技\" is correctly translated as \"enabling technologies.\"\n- The phrase \"門檻較低及容易落實\" is best translated as \"lower barriers to entry and easier to implement,\" which is both natural and commonly used in professional English.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and accurate phrasing from the junior translations, ensuring clarity, correctness, and natural flow.\nThe final translation is:\nHKMA and Cyberport, with the assistance of Deloitte, jointly organized the second \"Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regtech Lab (AMLab 2)\", primarily focusing on enabling technologies that have lower barriers to entry and are easier to implement.\n\n# September 2nd\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introducing consumer protection measures for banks' \"Pay Later\" products to promote responsible lending. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nStrengths of the translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the inclusion of \"Pay Later\" as the term for the product. However, there are notable weaknesses. The first and fourth translations use \"regarding\" which is slightly less direct than \"for\" or \"on.\" The fifth translation incorrectly uses \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" instead of \"Pay Later,\" which is not one of the approved translations in the dictionary. The third and sixth translations use \"banks’\" with an apostrophe, which is acceptable but less formal than \"banks'.\" Additionally, the use of quotation marks and apostrophes varies, which affects consistency.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements can be made: use \"HKMA\" for brevity, use \"for\" instead of \"regarding\" for clarity, and ensure consistent use of quotation marks and apostrophes. Also, \"Pay Later\" should be used as it is the most direct and concise translation from the dictionary.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe HKMA has introduced a series of consumer protection measures for banks' \"Pay Later\" products to promote responsible lending.\n\n# September 8th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, announcing the launch of two initiatives by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have generally done a good job, but there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and consistency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for 金管局, \"Banking GPS\" for 銀行業導航, and \"Future Banking Bridging Programme\" for 銀行業銜接課程.\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, with only minor variations in prepositions and articles.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"the\" before \"one-stop online resource platform\" is inconsistent. Some translations use \"a,\" others use \"the.\" While both are grammatically correct, \"a\" is more natural in this context as it introduces a new entity.\n- The use of quotation marks and apostrophes is inconsistent. Some translations use double quotation marks (\"...\"), others use single quotation marks ('...'), and one uses \"called\" with quotation marks. For consistency, double quotation marks are preferable in formal writing.\n- The phrase \"second edition\" is used in some translations, while others use \"second\" alone. Both are acceptable, but \"second edition\" is more precise when referring to a program that has had previous iterations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"a\" instead of \"the\" before \"one-stop online resource platform\" for a more natural and standard phrasing.\n- Use double quotation marks consistently.\n- Use \"second edition\" for clarity and precision.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the launch of a one-stop online resource platform \"Banking GPS\" and the second edition of the \"Future Banking Bridging Programme.\"\n\n# September 16\n\nThe original text announces the extension of a specific loan repayment plan by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in collaboration with a lending coordination mechanism for SMEs. The key terms \"金管局\" and \"銀行業中小企貸款協調機制\" must be translated using the exact English alternatives provided in the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and correctly extends the plan until the end of January 2023. However, it uses \"program\" instead of \"plan\" or \"scheme,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"principal repayment holiday,\" which is a less common term in financial contexts and may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term. It also uses \"scheme\" instead of \"plan,\" which is acceptable but not the most natural choice.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very detailed and accurate, using \"Pre-approval Interest-Only Payment Without Principal Repayment.\" However, the phrasing is somewhat wordy and less concise than necessary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and \"plan,\" which are natural and precise. The only minor issue is the use of \"plan\" instead of \"scheme\" or \"program,\" but this is not a major concern.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"pre-approval to repay interest without repaying principal,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing. It also uses \"plan\" and \"by three months,\" which is acceptable but not the most concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation uses \"pre-approved principal repayment suspension,\" which is not the most accurate term for the described policy. The term \"suspension\" implies a temporary halt, which may not fully capture the intent of the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use the most accurate financial terminology. \"Pre-approved interest-only repayment\" is the most precise and commonly used term in this context. The term \"plan\" is more natural than \"scheme\" or \"program\" in this context. The phrase \"until the end of January 2023\" is clear and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" plan for three months until the end of January 2023.\n\nOn the same day, the Mortgage Guarantee Corporation announced that the principal moratorium arrangement under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme would also be extended accordingly, allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for a maximum of 36 months of principal moratorium.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in style, formality, and word choice that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Pilot Scheme on Training Subsidy for Fintech Practitioners\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The term \"HKMA\" is used appropriately in several translations, which is more concise and commonly used in official contexts.\n- The use of \"banking sector\" or \"banking industry\" is appropriate, though \"sector\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official announcements.\nWeaknesses:\n- The first translation uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in full, which is correct but less concise than \"HKMA.\"\n- The second translation uses \"has finalized\" and \"has officially launched,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly repetitive.\n- The third and fourth translations use \"program\" instead of \"scheme,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable.\n- The fifth translation uses \"HKMA\" consistently and is concise, but the use of \"officially\" is slightly less formal than \"formally.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"formally launched\" and \"banking industry,\" which is slightly more formal and precise.\nImprovements:\n- To maintain consistency and conciseness, \"HKMA\" should be used throughout.\n- \"Formally launched\" is more appropriate in an official context than \"officially launched.\"\n- \"Banking sector\" is more commonly used in formal announcements than \"banking industry.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"HKMA,\" \"formally launched,\" and \"banking sector\" for a natural, formal tone.\nFinal Translation:\nHKMA has finalized the implementation details of the \"Pilot Scheme on Training Subsidy for Fintech Practitioners\" and formally launched the scheme in the banking sector.\n\n# September 27\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core information of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"non-exchange traded investment product\" (singular) inconsistently with the plural \"investment product\" later in the sentence. It also uses \"HKD 50,150 billion,\" which is numerically incorrect (should be 501.5 billion or 5.015 trillion).\n  \n- **Translation 2** correctly uses \"RIs\" as an abbreviation for \"registered institutions\" and \"unlisted investment products\" as an alternative to \"non-exchange traded.\" However, it uses \"HKD 5.015 trillion,\" which is a correct rephrasing of the original number but may be less precise than the exact figure given in the original text.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"licensed entities\" instead of \"licensed corporations,\" which is a slight deviation from the original term. It also uses \"50,150 billion HKD,\" which is numerically incorrect.\n- **Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"non-exchange-traded investment products\" and \"HKD 50,150 billion.\" However, the number is still numerically incorrect.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"non-exchange traded investment products\" and \"HKD 501.5 billion,\" which is a correct rephrasing of the original number. It also uses \"licensed corporations\" and \"registered institutions\" correctly.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate in terms of both terminology and numerical representation, using \"non-exchange-traded investment products\" and \"HKD 501.5 billion.\" It also uses \"licensed corporations\" and \"registered institutions\" correctly.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"registered institutions,\" \"investment product,\" and \"HKD.\"\n- Correctly represent the number \"50,150億港元\" as \"HKD 501.5 billion.\"\n- Use \"non-exchange-traded investment products\" as the most accurate and commonly used term.\n- Maintain fluency and natural English structure.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations, particularly Translation 6, while ensuring numerical accuracy and proper terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe SFC and the HKMA published the results of their second annual joint survey on the sale of non-exchange-traded investment products by licensed corporations and registered institutions. A total of 327 licensed corporations and 63 registered institutions reported data on their sales of investment products during 2021, with total transaction value reaching HKD 501.5 billion. The number of participating investors increased by 5% to 770,000.\n\n# September 27\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Enhanced Competency Framework (ECF),\" \"compliance function,\" and \"practitioners.\"\n- Most translations use \"develop\" or \"establish\" to convey the creation of standards, which is appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"adoptable by the industry\" which is slightly awkward and less natural than \"adoptable across the industry.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"competency standards\" instead of \"capability standards,\" which is a minor deviation from the original, though both are acceptable.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"for the banking sector\" instead of \"for the compliance function,\" which slightly misplaces the focus.\n- **Translation 4** is the most comprehensive, using \"common, transparent competency standards that can be adopted across the industry,\" which is both natural and precise.\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the original, but \"thereby enhancing\" is slightly less direct than \"to enhance.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"module\" instead of \"unit,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary term \"unit,\" and \"professionalism\" is less precise than \"professional capabilities.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"unit\" (not \"module\"), \"capability standards,\" and \"compliance function.\"\n- Use natural, fluent English that reads smoothly in professional contexts.\n- Ensure that the purpose of the initiative is clearly stated: to enhance the professional capabilities of practitioners in the compliance function.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, particularly Translation 4, while ensuring strict adherence to the dictionary terms and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced a \"Compliance\" unit under the \"Enhanced Competency Framework\" (ECF) to work with the banking industry to develop a set of common, transparent capability standards that can be adopted across the industry, thereby enhancing the professional capabilities of practitioners engaged in compliance functions.\n\n# October 6\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"HKAB,\" \"SVF sectors,\" \"Hong Kong Police Force,\" and \"anti-fraud search engine 'Scameter.'\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, and the main message is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"enhance,\" \"strengthen,\" and \"reduce\" is appropriate and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" instead of \"HKAB,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary and may confuse readers familiar with the standard abbreviation.\n- **Translation 5** includes the full names of HKMA and HKAB in parentheses, which adds clarity but is not necessary if the abbreviations are well-known in the context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"cessation\" instead of \"suppression\" or \"prevention,\" which is less common in the context of fraud and may be less natural.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"financial losses to the public,\" which is slightly more natural than \"public financial losses,\" but both are acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistency in the use of abbreviations (e.g., \"HKMA\" and \"HKAB\") unless the full names are necessary for clarity.\n- Use \"suppression\" or \"prevention\" consistently, as these are standard terms in the context of fraud.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"reduce financial losses to the public\" is used consistently for clarity and natural flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the HKAB, banks, and SVF sectors, supports the Hong Kong Police Force in launching the anti-fraud search engine \"Scameter\" to enhance the prevention, detection, and suppression of fraudulent activities in society and reduce financial losses to the public.\n\nIn addition to issuing practical guidelines and updating relevant FAQs, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with banks and the SVF sectors to raise public awareness of scam protection through consumer education information on websites and social media, and has published inSight articles to elaborate on this work.\n\n# October 20th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, where the month and day are written in numerals with the month preceding the day. The translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to the correct format, with only minor differences in punctuation and formatting.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"October 20th,\" which is the standard way to write dates in English, including the ordinal suffix \"-th.\" This is grammatically correct and natural in English.\nThe second, fifth, and third translations use \"October 20\" or \"# October 20.\" The use of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and not standard in English date formatting. \"October 20\" is also grammatically correct but lacks the ordinal suffix, which is commonly used in English to denote the day of the month in full date formats.\nThe best translation would be \"October 20th,\" as it is the most natural and standard way to express the date in English, without unnecessary symbols or missing grammatical elements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"pre-approved principal and interest repayment moratorium,\" which is slightly inaccurate. The original term is “預先批核還息不還本,” which refers to a scheme where interest is paid but principal is not, not a full moratorium. Also, \"pre-approved\" may not be the best term here.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment plan,\" which is more accurate. However, it omits the \"until the end of July 2023\" and uses \"optimized the partial principal repayment arrangement\" without the article \"the.\"\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"pre-approved principal and interest repayment suspension,\" which is again slightly off. The term \"suspension\" implies a complete halt, which is not the case. Also, \"has optimized\" is in the present perfect tense, which is less appropriate in this context.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment scheme\" and \"until July 2023\" (missing \"end of\"). Also, \"enterprises capable of preparing\" is awkward phrasing.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"Pre-approved Interest-Only Repayment\" with capitalization, which is unnecessary. Also, \"enterprises with the capacity to prepare\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and \"partial principal repayment arrangements\" (plural, which may not match the dictionary). Also, \"viable enterprises\" is a slight deviation from the original term \"有能力的企業.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" as per the dictionary and context.\n- Use \"partial principal repayment arrangement\" as specified.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the preferred term.\n- Ensure the date is \"until the end of July 2023.\"\n- Use natural, fluent English without awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme for another six months until the end of July 2023, and the optimization of the partial principal repayment arrangement to assist capable enterprises in preparing to gradually resume normal repayments.\n\nThe original text announces an extension of the application period and the maximum term for a specific arrangement under a government-backed financing guarantee scheme. The dictionary provides two options for \"中小企融資擔保計劃\" (SME Financing Guarantee Scheme) and one for \"還息不還本安排\" (principal moratorium arrangement). All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, though with slight variations in phrasing and structure.\n**Translation Review:**\n- **Translation 1** is concise and accurate but lacks the name of the insurance company, which is mentioned in the original text as \"按證保險公司\" (Amex Insurance Company). It also uses \"maximum term\" instead of \"upper limit,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 2** is well-structured and includes the insurance company name (\"Amex Insurance Company\"), which is more accurate. It uses \"upper limit\" and \"total maximum,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"has been extended by six months until the end of June 2023,\" which is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 3** is accurate and includes the insurance company name. It uses \"upper limit\" and \"maximum of 42 months in total,\" which is clear. However, it unnecessarily places quotation marks around \"principal moratorium arrangement,\" which is not required in the original text.\n- **Translation 4** is accurate and concise. It uses \"June 30, 2023\" instead of \"end of June 2023,\" which is more specific. It also uses \"cap\" for \"upper limit,\" which is a valid synonym.\n- **Translation 5** is accurate but places \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" before \"principal moratorium arrangement,\" which slightly alters the original structure. It also uses \"maximum of 42 months in total,\" which is clear.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly identifies the insurance company as \"Mortgage Corporation\" instead of \"Amex Insurance Company.\" It also uses \"cap\" for \"upper limit,\" which is acceptable, but the error in the company name is a significant issue.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include the correct insurance company name (\"Amex Insurance Company\"), use the dictionary terms accurately, and maintain clarity and fluency. It should also avoid unnecessary quotation marks and use precise terms like \"upper limit\" or \"cap\" appropriately. The most accurate and fluent translation would combine the strengths of translations 2 and 4, using \"Amex Insurance Company,\" \"upper limit,\" and \"June 30, 2023.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nAmex Insurance Company also announced that the application period for the principal moratorium arrangement under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has been extended by six months to June 30, 2023, and the upper limit has been extended by six months to a maximum of 42 months in total.\n\n# October 21\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding regulatory updates. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"circulars\" and \"requirements for the sale and distribution.\" The term \"circulars\" is acceptable but less commonly used in regulatory contexts compared to \"notices.\" The phrasing is fluent and accurate.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"notices\" and includes \"relevant requirements.\" This is more precise and aligns with formal regulatory language. The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Identical to the second, with no errors. It is a strong translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"sales\" (singular) instead of \"sale and distribution\" (plural), which is slightly less precise. Also uses \"notices,\" which is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"circulars\" again and \"relevant requirements.\" The structure is good, but \"circulars\" is less standard in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"notices\" and \"relevant requirements,\" with a slight pause before \"and to provide guidance,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluid.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe most consistent and natural phrasing is found in translations 2, 3, and 6, which use \"notices\" and \"relevant requirements.\" \"Notices\" is more standard in regulatory contexts than \"circulars,\" and \"relevant requirements\" adds clarity. The use of \"sale and distribution\" (plural) is more precise than \"sales\" (singular). The punctuation before \"and to provide guidance\" can be streamlined for better flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued two notices to update the relevant requirements for the sale and distribution of loss-absorption products and to provide guidance on suitability assessments.\n\n# November 24\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Cyberport,\" \"network analytics,\" \"mule account networks,\" and \"AML Regtech Lab (AMLab 3).\" However, the term \"反洗錢合規科技實驗室\" is translated as either \"AML Regtech Lab\" or \"AML Regtech Labs.\" The original text uses the singular form \"實驗室,\" so \"AML Regtech Lab\" is more appropriate.\n2. **Verb Tense and Aspect**: Some translations use the present continuous tense (\"are hosting\") while others use the past tense (\"hosted\") or present tense (\"is hosting\"). The original text uses the present tense for the ongoing collaboration and the past tense for the event itself. A balanced approach using the present tense for the ongoing collaboration and the past tense for the event is more accurate.\n3. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first and second translations are slightly awkward in structure, particularly in the first sentence. The third and sixth translations are more fluent and grammatically sound. The fifth translation is concise and clear but omits \"scams\" in the last sentence, which slightly weakens the meaning.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard business English and accurately reflect the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA, in collaboration with Cyberport and with the assistance of Deloitte, is hosting the third \"AML Regtech Lab (AMLab 3).\" AMLab 3 builds on the achievements of previous AMLab series, utilizing network analytics to address fraud risks and reduce losses caused by mule account network scams.\n\n# November 28\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 11月28日,\" where \"#\" is likely used as a heading or marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English. The first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"November 28\" and \"November 28th,\" which are both grammatically correct. However, in English, the use of \"28th\" is optional and often omitted in formal or concise contexts. The second, third, and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original format. However, in English, the use of \"#\" as a heading is less common unless it's part of a specific formatting convention. \nThe best approach is to maintain the original format while ensuring the date is presented in a natural and commonly accepted English format. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"# November 28,\" which preserves the original structure while using the standard English date format.\n\nWith the strong support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the \"Credit Reference Platform\" under the Multiple Credit Reference Agencies (MCRAs) model has commenced operations to enhance the service levels of consumer credit reference agencies in Hong Kong and reduce operational risks arising from the current market having only one commercially operated service provider.\n\n# December 7\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding a legislative amendment. The key elements to translate accurately are the name of the authority (\"金管局\") and the name of the legislative bill (\"打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（修訂）條例草案\").\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and correctly translates the bill as \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.\" However, the bill is a \"draft amendment\" (修訂條例草案), which should be reflected in the translation. Also, the phrase \"which will take effect in June 2023\" is slightly misplaced, making the sentence structure awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and includes \"(Amendment) Bill 2022\" in the bill's name. However, the phrase \"which will come into effect in June 2023\" is misplaced, and the structure is slightly unclear.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and includes \"(Amendment) Bill 2022\" in the bill's name. The sentence structure is clear and accurate, with the correct placement of the effective date. This is a strong translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and includes \"(Amendment) Bill\" in the bill's name. The structure is clear, but the phrase \"which will come into effect in June 2023\" is slightly awkwardly placed.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and includes \"(Amendment) Bill 2022\" in the bill's name. The sentence structure is clear and accurate, with the effective date correctly placed. This is also a strong translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Repeats the first junior translator's translation, with the same issues regarding the omission of \"(Amendment) Bill 2022\" and the awkward placement of the effective date.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and formality.\n- Accurately reflect the bill's name as \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Amendment) Bill 2022.\"\n- Clearly state that the bill will take effect in June 2023.\n- Use a natural and fluent sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a notice to banks regarding the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Amendment) Bill 2022, which will take effect in June 2023, clarifying the latest amendments related to the banking sector.\n\n# December 15th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translators used \"December 15th,\" which is the standard English format for dates when the day is written as a cardinal number followed by \"th.\" This format is appropriate and commonly used in formal and informal contexts.\nThe third translator used \"December 15,\" which is also correct but omits the \"th\" suffix. While this is grammatically acceptable in some contexts, it is less common in formal writing and may appear less polished compared to \"December 15th.\"\nThe fifth and sixth translators included the \"#\" symbol in their translations, which is consistent with the original text. However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is typically used for hashtags or to denote a section, and its inclusion may depend on the context in which the date is being used. If this is a heading or section title, retaining the \"#\" is appropriate. If it is part of a list or a document, it may be better to omit it unless it serves a specific function.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are correct, but \"December 15th\" is the most standard and polished form. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is context-dependent, but since it was present in the original text, it is reasonable to retain it in the translation.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be \"December 15th\" if the \"#\" symbol is not necessary, or \"# December 15th\" if it is intended to serve as a heading or section title. Given the original format, the latter is more consistent with the source text.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"AML\/CFT,\" \"SVF sectors,\" \"AML Suptech,\" \"Regtech,\" \"suspicious transaction reporting,\" and \"counter-proliferation financing risk.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with all translations using a similar format: \"The [HKMA] [verb] a [seminar\/lecture] on [topic] for [audience], covering [topics].\"\n- The use of \"seminar\" or \"lecture\" is appropriate, though \"seminar\" is more commonly used in professional or regulatory contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** The first junior translator uses \"organized,\" while others use \"held\" or \"hosted.\" \"Hosted\" is more natural in this context.\n- **\"Regulatory requirements on source of wealth\" vs. \"regulatory requirements for source of wealth\":** The phrase \"on\" is more appropriate when referring to the subject of the requirements, while \"for\" implies the requirements are directed at the source of wealth, which is less precise.\n- **\"The SVF sectors\" vs. \"SVF sectors\":** The use of \"the\" before \"SVF sectors\" is unnecessary and adds redundancy.\n- **\"Counter-proliferation financing risk\" vs. \"counter-proliferation financing risk\":** The term is correctly used in all translations, but consistency in phrasing is important.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"hosted\" as the verb for a more natural and professional tone.\n- Use \"on\" when referring to \"regulatory requirements on source of wealth\" for grammatical accuracy.\n- Omit \"the\" before \"SVF sectors\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure consistent use of terms and prepositions throughout the translation.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA hosted a seminar on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) for banks and SVF sectors, covering updates on regulatory requirements, AML Suptech and Regtech, regulatory requirements on source of wealth, feedback on suspicious transaction reporting, and updates on counter-proliferation financing risk.\n\n# December 23\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Mandatory Provident Fund Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions\" and \"Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies.\"\n- Most translations use \"regulatory authorities\" or \"regulators\" appropriately for \"監管機構.\"\n- The term \"mystery shopping programme\" is used consistently, though some translations use \"joint mystery shopping programme,\" which is also acceptable but slightly redundant given the context of multiple agencies collaborating.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the three regulators\" but does not explicitly name the three agencies, which may be less precise.\n- **Translation 2** introduces \"Insurance Authority (IA)\" without prior mention, which may be unnecessary unless the audience is familiar with the abbreviation.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"sales tactics\" instead of \"sales practices,\" which is a minor but notable deviation from the original.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Office of the Commissioner of Insurance\" instead of \"Insurance Authority,\" which is not listed in the dictionary and may be outdated or incorrect.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"best practices\" instead of \"good practices,\" which is a slight deviation in tone and may not align with the original's phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The original text emphasizes that the three agencies conducted the first **joint** mystery shopping programme, so \"joint mystery shopping programme\" should be used to reflect the collaboration.\n- The term \"sales practices\" is more appropriate than \"sales tactics\" in a regulatory context.\n- The full name \"Insurance Authority\" should be used unless the abbreviation is well-established in the target audience.\n- \"Good practices\" is more aligned with the original than \"best practices.\"\n- The phrase \"regulatory authorities\" is more formal and appropriate for the context than \"regulators.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority jointly issued a circular outlining the main results and observed good practices from their first joint mystery shopping programme regarding the sales practices of intermediaries in selling two tax-deductible products, namely Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Mandatory Provident Fund Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\n# December 31st\n# 12月31日\nThe original text is a simple date: December 31st. The dictionary is empty, so there are no specific terms that need to be translated using predefined alternatives. The junior translators have provided several versions of the translation, all of which are essentially correct.\nThe first, third, fourth, and fifth translations all use \"December 31st,\" which is the standard and most natural way to express this date in English. The second and sixth translations use \"# December 31\" and \"# December 31st,\" respectively. The use of the hashtag (#) is unnecessary in this context unless the date is being used as a social media tag or heading, which is not indicated in the original text. Additionally, the second translation omits the \"st\" in \"31st,\" which is grammatically correct but less formal and slightly less precise.\nThe best translation would be \"December 31st,\" as it is the most natural and grammatically correct form in standard English usage. It avoids unnecessary punctuation and adheres to standard date formatting conventions.\nDecember 31st\n\nAll six translations are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and the use of specific terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"domestic systemically important banks\" from the dictionary.\n- The term \"resolvability\" is used appropriately in all translations, as required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"HKMA\" is used in most translations, with only one using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is also acceptable.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent and clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"resolvability\" as a noun in the phrase \"in the event of resolvability,\" which is grammatically incorrect. \"Resolvability\" is an abstract concept and cannot be the event of something happening.\n- **Translation 3** similarly misuses \"resolvability\" in \"during resolvability,\" which is not a standard phrase and lacks clarity.\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 4** both use \"in the event of resolution,\" which is more natural and grammatically correct than \"resolvability\" in this context.\n- **Translation 5** and **Translation 6** use \"during resolution,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less precise than \"in the event of resolution\" when referring to a potential future event.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"resilience\" instead of \"stability,\" which is a minor but notable deviation from the original term \"穩健性\" (stability).\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"in the event of resolution\" to accurately reflect the original meaning, as it refers to a potential future event. \"Resolvability\" should be used as a noun to describe the quality of being resolvable, not as a substitute for \"resolution.\" The term \"stability\" is more accurate than \"resilience\" in this context. Using \"HKMA\" is more concise and appropriate in formal writing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAll domestic systemically important banks in Hong Kong have established a new layer of financial resources to absorb losses in the event of resolution, marking a milestone for the HKMA in enhancing the resolvability of such banks and the stability of the banking system.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\n# January 12th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese to denote a specific day. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with slight differences in formatting and punctuation. The most common translations are \"January 12th\" and \"January 12.\" The use of \"th\" is optional in English, but it is more common in formal or written contexts to include it for clarity. The use of the \"#\" symbol is not standard in English date formats and appears to be an unnecessary addition. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"January 12th\" as it is the most natural and commonly used format in English.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" \"穩定幣\" as \"stablecoins,\" and \"討論文件\" as \"discussion paper.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message—that the HKMA has released a discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins, outlining a regulatory framework and inviting feedback—is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"regulatory framework,\" \"regulatory approach,\" and \"regulatory regime\" is appropriate and consistent with the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use \"crypto-assets\" while others use \"cryptocurrency assets\" or \"cryptocurrency.\" While all are acceptable, \"crypto assets\" is more concise and commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **Fluency and style:** Some translations are slightly more formal or verbose than others. For example, \"inviting views from the industry and the public\" is slightly less direct than \"inviting the industry and the public to provide feedback.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the HKMA’s thinking on the regulatory framework for crypto assets\" or \"the HKMA's proposed regulatory approach to crypto assets.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"crypto assets\" consistently for \"加密資產\" to maintain clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"regulatory framework\" or \"regulatory regime\" consistently for \"監管模式.\"\n- Ensure that the verb tenses and sentence structures are parallel and natural in English.\n- Avoid redundancy by streamlining phrases like \"inviting the industry and the public to provide feedback.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be concise, fluent, and consistent with the original message and terminology.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins. The paper outlines the HKMA’s proposed regulatory framework for crypto assets, particularly stablecoins used for payment purposes, and invites the industry and the public to provide feedback on the proposed regulatory framework.\n\n# January 27th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 1月27日,\" where \"1月27日\" translates to \"January 27th\" in English. The use of the \"#\" symbol is likely a heading or label, which is common in formatting for lists or entries.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in formatting. The first, third, and fifth translators used \"January 27th,\" which is the most natural and complete way to express the date in English. The second, fourth, and sixth translators used \"January 27\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is grammatically acceptable but less formal. Additionally, they included the \"#\" symbol, which may or may not be necessary depending on the context.\nSince the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it is reasonable to retain it in the translation to maintain consistency with the original formatting. However, the use of \"January 27th\" is more natural and complete in English, especially in formal or written contexts.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use \"January 27th\" for the date. This preserves the original formatting while ensuring the date is expressed in the most natural and complete way in English.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about a joint online event between two institutions. The junior translators have all correctly used the dictionary terms, which is a strong point. However, there are minor differences in the choice of verbs (\"jointly hosted\" vs. \"co-hosted\") and the use of abbreviations (\"HKMA\" vs. \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\").\n\"Co-hosted\" and \"jointly hosted\" are both grammatically correct and convey the same meaning, though \"co-hosted\" is slightly more concise and commonly used in formal contexts. The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate when the full name has been used earlier in the text, but since this is the first mention, using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more formal and appropriate for an official statement.\nThe translations are all fluent and grammatically sound, with no major errors. However, for consistency and formality, using the full name of the institution on first mention is preferable.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the full name of the institution on first mention, and use \"co-hosted\" for conciseness and formality.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the State Secretariat for International Finance under the Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland co-hosted the fifth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue online.\n\n# February\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"FATF,\" \"AML\/CFT,\" and \"standard-setting body.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (reappointment, two-year term, FATF's role) is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of \"co-chair\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for the role described.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly refers to \"FATF Evaluations and Compliance Working Group\" as \"FATF’s FATF Evaluations and Compliance Working Group,\" which is redundant and grammatically incorrect.\n- **Translation 3** also uses \"standard-setting bodies\" (plural) when the original text uses \"standard-setting organization\" (singular), which is a mismatch.\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 4** use \"the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering,\" which is slightly less precise than \"for AML\/CFT,\" as the latter is a more commonly used acronym in the context of international financial crime prevention.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"on AML\/CFT\" instead of \"for AML\/CFT,\" which is less idiomatic in this context.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version but omits the parenthetical \"(HKMA)\" after the first mention of the organization, which is helpful for clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" with the parenthetical \"(Hong Kong Monetary Authority)\" on first mention for clarity.\n- Use \"FATF\" consistently without redundancy.\n- Use \"AML\/CFT\" as the preferred acronym for \"anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.\"\n- Use \"standard-setting body\" (singular) as the original text refers to a single organization.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and avoid redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been reappointed as co-chair of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Evaluations and Compliance Working Group for a two-year term. The Financial Action Task Force is a global standard-setting body for AML\/CFT.\n\n# February 11\n\nThe Mortgage Securities Company announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with 14 cooperating banks regarding the infrastructure loans framework, establishing key guidelines for cooperation on infrastructure loans.\n\n# February 14th\nThe original text is a simple date format, \"2月14日,\" which translates to \"February 14th\" in English. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators correctly used \"February 14th,\" which is the standard way to write the date in English when including the ordinal suffix. The second and fifth translators used \"February 14,\" which is also acceptable but lacks the ordinal suffix. The fourth and sixth translators included a \"#\" symbol before the date, which is not standard in English date formatting unless it is part of a specific heading or title format.\nGiven that the original text does not include a \"#\" symbol, it is best to omit it in the translation. The most natural and standard English translation would be \"February 14th.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about a research report published by a specific institution under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the institutions and the title of the report, which are provided in the dictionary. The translations by the junior translators mostly capture the meaning, but there are variations in structure and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for the report title and the names of the institutions.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The use of \"Applied Research report\" is consistent across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations are slightly wordy or repetitive, such as \"which is responsible for research under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance\" (Translation 2) or \"which is under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance and responsible for research work\" (Translation 6).\n- The placement of \"(English version)\" varies, but it is more natural to place it after the title, as in Translation 1 and 4.\n- Some translations use \"released\" instead of \"published,\" which is less formal and less commonly used in academic or institutional contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a concise structure that clearly indicates the relationship between the Hong Kong Academy of Finance and the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research.\n- Place \"(English version)\" immediately after the title for clarity and natural flow.\n- Use \"published\" rather than \"released\" to maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research, under the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, has published a new Applied Research report titled \"Demographic Changes and Long-Term Asset Markets: Opportunities and Developments in Hong Kong\" (English version).\n\n# March 8\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"IMF,\" \"Article IV Consultation,\" \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\" \"macroprudential policies,\" and \"financial sector.\" This is a strong point across all translations.\n2. **Fluency and Style**: The translations vary in fluency. For example, the first junior translator uses \"released an assessment report on the Article IV Consultation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2022,\" which is slightly wordy. The second and third translators use more concise phrasing, such as \"issued an assessment report on Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's 2022 Article IV Consultation,\" which is more natural in English.\n3. **Structure and Flow**: The third and fourth translations break the information into shorter, more digestible sentences, which improves readability. The fifth translation is also concise and flows well, though it uses \"resilient financial system\" instead of \"robust and resilient,\" which is slightly less precise.\n4. **Verb Choice**: The use of \"reaffirming\" (used in translations 2, 3, 4, and 5) is more natural than \"affirming\" (used in translations 1 and 6), as it implies a stronger, more definitive statement. \"Recognizes\" (translation 1 and 6) is slightly less formal than \"acknowledged\" (translations 2, 3, 4, 5), which is more commonly used in official reports.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they maintain the formal tone expected in official reports and use standard terminology related to international finance and policy.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe IMF delegation issued an assessment report on Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's 2022 Article IV Consultation, reaffirming Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. It highlighted Hong Kong's robust and resilient financial system, effective macroprudential policies, and sound regulatory and supervisory framework. The report also acknowledged the continued expansion and development of Hong Kong's financial sector during the pandemic.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary slightly in word choice and tone. All translations correctly use \"IMF\" for \"基金組織\" and \"green and sustainable finance\" for \"綠色和可持續金融,\" which aligns with the dictionary requirements. However, there are subtle differences in verb choice (\"commended,\" \"praised,\" \"acknowledged,\" \"recognized\") and adverb choice (\"continuous,\" \"relentless,\" \"persistent,\" \"tireless\") that affect the tone and emphasis of the sentence.\n\"Commended\" and \"praised\" are both appropriate, but \"commended\" may sound more formal and official, which is suitable for a statement from an international organization like the IMF. \"Acknowledged\" and \"recognized\" are similar, but \"recognized\" is slightly stronger and more formal. \"Relentless,\" \"persistent,\" and \"tireless\" all convey effort, but \"relentless\" and \"tireless\" are more vivid and impactful.\nThe best translation would use \"commended\" for a more formal tone and \"relentless\" or \"tireless\" to emphasize the government's sustained effort. \"Green and sustainable finance\" should be in lowercase unless it is a proper noun, which it is not in this context.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation would be:\nThe IMF also commended Hong Kong for its significant progress in addressing climate change and recognized the government's tireless efforts to strengthen the green and sustainable finance ecosystem.\n\n# March 30\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in word choice, verb tense, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Verb Choice (\"announce\" vs. \"publish\" vs. \"release\")**: The original Chinese uses “公布” (gongbu), which can be translated as \"announce,\" \"publish,\" or \"release.\" While all are acceptable, \"publish\" and \"release\" are more commonly used in formal contexts for official reports or assessments. \"Announce\" is also acceptable but slightly less precise in this context.\n2. **Tense Consistency**: Some translations use the present perfect (\"has published,\" \"has announced\"), while others use the simple past (\"announced\"). The original Chinese does not specify a time frame, so the simple past is more neutral and appropriate unless there is a clear indication of ongoing relevance.\n3. **\"Follow-up work\" vs. \"subsequent work\"**: Both are correct, but \"follow-up work\" is more commonly used in official or policy contexts and sounds more natural in this setting.\n4. **\"Carbon trading center\" vs. \"carbon trading hub\"**: Both are acceptable, but \"carbon trading center\" is more precise and aligns better with the term \"交易中心\" (jiaoyi zhongxin), which directly translates to \"trading center.\"\n5. **Capitalization and Consistency**: The term \"Steering Group\" should be consistently capitalized as it is a proper noun. Some translations use \"steering group\" in lowercase, which is less formal and less appropriate for an official body.\n6. **Fluency and Naturalness**: The sentence structure in some translations is slightly awkward, such as \"on the opportunities of Hong Kong's carbon market\" or \"on opportunities for a carbon market in Hong Kong.\" The more natural phrasing is \"on opportunities for Hong Kong's carbon market.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation should use \"published\" or \"released\" for \"公布,\" maintain consistent verb tense, use \"follow-up work,\" and ensure proper capitalization and natural phrasing.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group published an initial feasibility assessment on opportunities for Hong Kong's carbon market. Based on the assessment results, the Steering Group announced follow-up work to support Hong Kong's development into a regional carbon trading center.\n\n# April 12th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in style, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, though some use abbreviations (e.g., HKIMR and AoF) while others use the full names (e.g., Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research and Hong Kong Academy of Finance). The choice between abbreviations and full names depends on context and audience familiarity. In formal or international contexts, using the full names is preferable for clarity.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically correct. However, the placement of \"online\" varies. Some translations use \"online participants\" (e.g., translations 1, 3, 5), while others use \"participants online\" (e.g., translations 2, 4, 6). The former is more natural in English, as \"online participants\" is a standard phrase.\n3. **Verb Choice**: The verbs used to describe the event—“co-hosted,” “jointly organized,” and “hosted”—are all acceptable. However, “co-hosted” is the most commonly used and natural term in this context.\n4. **Punctuation and Style**: The use of quotation marks and commas is consistent across translations, though some use \"which\" to introduce the clause about participants (e.g., translations 4 and 5), while others use a comma (e.g., translations 1, 2, 3, 6). The use of \"which\" adds a slight pause and is more formal, but not necessary for clarity.\n5. **Title Format**: Translation 6 uses the word \"titled\" to introduce the seminar title, which is slightly more formal and precise than \"on,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research and the Hong Kong Academy of Finance co-hosted an online seminar on \"Macroeconomic Developments, Fed Tightening, and Offshore RMB Market Development,\" attracting 840,000 online participants.\nThis version uses the full names of the institutions for clarity, employs the natural phrase \"online participants,\" and maintains a concise and fluent structure.\n\n# April 27\n<\/think>\nApril 27\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" \"discussion paper\" for \"討論文件,\" and \"e-HKD\" for \"數碼港元.\"\n- Most translations accurately reflect the main idea: the HKMA has issued a discussion paper on the policy and design aspects of introducing a retail CBDC (e-HKD) in Hong Kong and is seeking public input.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"digital Hong Kong dollar\" redundantly, as \"e-HKD\" already implies this. It also uses \"public opinion,\" which is slightly less precise than \"public feedback.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"A Discussion Paper on the Policy and Design Considerations of 'e-HKD'\" as the title, which is awkward and repetitive. It also uses \"CBDC\" without specifying \"retail.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"retail CBDC\" redundantly after \"retail central bank digital currency.\" It also uses \"soliciting feedback,\" which is slightly less common than \"seeking feedback.\"\n- **Translation 4** repeats \"e-HKD\" unnecessarily and uses \"Looking at 'e-HKD' from the Perspectives of Policy and Design,\" which is less formal and less precise than the original title.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"retail CBDC\" twice and places it in quotes unnecessarily. It also uses \"specifically 'e-HKD' or'retail CBDC'\" which is redundant and awkward.\n- **Translation 6** is the most concise and accurate, using \"retail central bank digital currency (retail CBDC)\" and \"e-HKD\" appropriately. However, it could be more precise in the title and slightly more fluent.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The title should be concise and reflect the original Chinese title accurately: \"From Policy and Design Perspectives on 'e-HKD'.\"\n- \"Retail central bank digital currency\" should be used in full before abbreviating to \"retail CBDC\" for clarity.\n- \"Seeking public feedback\" is more natural and commonly used than \"seeking public opinion\" or \"soliciting feedback.\"\n- Avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"e-HKD\" unnecessarily or using \"retail CBDC\" twice in the same sentence.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a discussion paper titled \"From Policy and Design Perspectives on 'e-HKD',\" outlining the key policy and design considerations involved in introducing a retail central bank digital currency (retail CBDC), i.e., e-HKD, in Hong Kong, and seeking public feedback.\n\n# May 3rd\n\nThe original sentence is a complex one, involving multiple entities and a specific event. The junior translators have generally captured the key elements, but there are variations in structure, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Alliance for Green Commercial Banks,\" \"Green and Sustainable Capital Market Evolution Roundtable Session,\" \"International Finance Corporation,\" \"World Bank Group,\" and \"HKMA.\"\n- Most translations correctly identify the co-hosts: the Alliance and Standard Chartered Bank.\n- The event is described as being held \"online,\" which is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** incorrectly uses \"Citibank\" instead of \"Standard Chartered Bank.\"\n- **Translation 2** and **3** use \"co-hosted\" but place the event description (\"online\") at the end, which is slightly less clear.\n- **Translation 5** and **6** are identical and incorrectly state that the HKMA and IFC \"launched\" the Alliance, which is not accurate. The Alliance was \"initiated\" by them, not \"launched.\"\n- **Translation 4** is the most accurate in terms of structure and clarity, but it uses \"HKMA\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure that \"Standard Chartered Bank\" is used consistently.\n- Place \"online\" closer to the event name for clarity.\n- Avoid the incorrect use of \"launched\" for the Alliance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe \"Alliance for Green Commercial Banks,\" initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, co-hosted the \"Green and Sustainable Capital Market Evolution Roundtable Session\" online with Standard Chartered Bank.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

Outlook for 2023\n\nDespite the signs of recovery in Hong Kong's economy at the beginning of 2023, the external environment remains full of challenges and uncertainties. Recent pressures on the banking sectors in the United States and Europe, with individual U.S. banks collapsing in March 2023, have created ripple effects across global financial markets. Meanwhile, the tightening of monetary policies by major central banks is likely to slow down or even cause a global economic recession in 2023. On the other hand, tense geopolitical situations and the ongoing threat of de-globalisation may continue to drag down global trade and lead to occasional fluctuations in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, with its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for 金管局, \"monetary and financial stability\" for 貨幣及金融穩定, \"macroeconomic environment\" for 宏觀經濟環境, \"liquidity positions\" for 流動性, and \"EF\" or \"Exchange Fund\" for 外匯基金. This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are well-structured and grammatically sound. However, there are slight variations in tone and word choice that affect the overall naturalness of the English. For instance, \"places great emphasis on\" and \"attaches great importance to\" are both correct, but \"places great importance on\" is slightly more idiomatic in formal contexts. Similarly, \"leading international financial centre\" (British spelling) versus \"financial center\" (American spelling) is a minor but notable difference.\nThe phrase \"sustain high liquidity positions\" appears in some translations, while others use \"maintain high liquidity positions.\" Both are acceptable, but \"maintain\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. Additionally, the use of \"prudently manage the Exchange Fund\" is more precise than \"invest prudently in managing the EF,\" as it better reflects the role of the HKMA in overseeing the fund rather than directly investing in it.\nThe best translation would combine the most natural phrasing, correct terminology, and consistent style. It should use \"HKMA\" consistently, avoid unnecessary abbreviations like \"EF\" unless required, and use \"maintain\" rather than \"sustain\" for liquidity positions. It should also ensure that the tone is formal and consistent with official statements from the HKMA.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation would be:\nThe HKMA places great importance on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's position as a major international financial center. In the challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and maintain high liquidity positions.\n\n# The original Traditional Chinese text is \"# 金融體系保持穩定健全\". The junior translators have all produced translations that are essentially identical in meaning and structure, with minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. The phrase \"金融體系\" is correctly translated as \"financial system\" in all translations, and \"保持穩定健全\" is accurately rendered as \"remains stable and sound\" in all cases. However, there are some inconsistencies in formatting and presentation.\nThe first, second, sixth, and third translations differ only in the presence of the \"#\" symbol and the capitalization of \"Financial System\". The use of \"#\" is not standard in English unless it is part of a heading or title format. In this context, it appears to be an unnecessary addition, likely carried over from the original Chinese formatting. Similarly, capitalizing \"Financial System\" as a title is not standard unless it is part of a formal heading or title.\nThe best translation would be the one that is most natural and fluent in English, without unnecessary symbols or capitalization. The translation \"The financial system remains stable and sound.\" is the most appropriate, as it is grammatically correct, fluent, and does not include any extraneous formatting.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is:\nThe financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of vocabulary choice, phrasing, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"global economic prospect\" for \"環球經濟前景\" and either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The core message is preserved across all translations: the global economic outlook is uncertain, the HKMA is monitoring developments and managing risks, and this is essential for maintaining financial stability and the normal functioning of Hong Kong's economy.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"remain constrained by\" while others use \"remain subject to.\" Both are acceptable, but \"subject to\" may be more idiomatic in this context.\n- **Use of \"critical\" vs. \"essential\":** \"Critical\" and \"essential\" are both valid, but \"essential\" is more commonly used in formal policy statements.\n- **\"Lifeline\" vs. \"lifeblood\":** Both are metaphorical expressions, but \"lifeline\" is more commonly used in economic contexts to describe something vital.\n- **\"Continuously providing\" vs. \"continued provision\":** \"Continued provision\" is more formal and better suited to the tone of the original text.\n- **\"Maintaining the normal operation\" vs. \"normal operation\":** The former is more precise and aligns better with the original's emphasis on the importance of the financial system.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"subject to\" for \"受制於\" as it is more idiomatic in formal writing.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the preferred term for \"金管局\" due to its brevity and common usage in official contexts.\n- Use \"essential\" for \"關鍵\" as it is more standard in formal policy language.\n- Use \"lifeline\" for \"命脈\" as it is a well-established metaphor in economic discourse.\n- Use \"continued provision\" for \"持續提供\" to maintain a formal tone.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is clear and that the causal relationship between financial stability and economic operation is emphasized.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe global economic prospect remains subject to significant uncertainties. The HKMA will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system; this is a prerequisite for the continued provision of essential financial services and is therefore the lifeline for maintaining the normal operation of Hong Kong's economy.\n\n# Stay Vigilant About Potential Risks\n\nIn 2023, the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of U.S. interest rates, as well as pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, persistent geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and lead to occasional volatility in global financial markets. However, the Hong Kong financial system, bolstered by its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and style that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The core message of monitoring risks and vulnerabilities, taking appropriate measures, and studying economic matters is consistently preserved.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the formal tone appropriate for an official statement.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"take appropriate measures as needed\" (used in translations 1, 5, and 6) versus \"take appropriate measures as necessary\" (used in translation 4). While both are grammatically correct, \"as necessary\" is more formal and commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Redundancy:** Translations 2 and 3 repeat \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" twice, which is slightly redundant. Using \"The HKMA\" in the second sentence would be more concise and natural.\n- **Consistency in Pronouns:** Translation 6 omits the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" in both sentences, which is less formal and less consistent with the other translations.\n- **Use of \"may affect\" vs. \"affect\":** Translations 1 and 3 use \"may affect,\" which is more cautious and appropriate for an official statement, while translations 2, 4, 5, and 6 use \"affect,\" which is more direct. The original Chinese uses \"有影響\" (has an impact), which is neutral and does not imply uncertainty, so \"affect\" is more accurate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for brevity and formality.\n- Use \"as necessary\" instead of \"as needed\" for a more formal tone.\n- Avoid repetition by using \"it\" or \"the HKMA\" in the second sentence.\n- Use \"affect\" rather than \"may affect\" to align with the neutral tone of the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the risks and vulnerabilities in the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as necessary to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. It will also study matters that affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintaining Banking Stability\nThe original text is a heading: \"# 保持銀行體系穩定\". The key term \"銀行體系穩定\" must be translated as \"Banking Stability\" per the dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used this term. However, there are differences in the verb forms and the use of the hashtag.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use \"Maintaining Banking Stability,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English as a heading. The second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Maintain Banking Stability,\" which is also correct but slightly more direct and less commonly used as a heading. The fifth and sixth translations include the hashtag \"#\", which is consistent with the original text's formatting.\nThe best translation should retain the hashtag to match the original format and use \"Maintaining Banking Stability\" for its natural flow as a heading.\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, the junior translators have generally produced fluent and accurate translations. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, word choice, and structure that can be refined for greater clarity, conciseness, and natural flow in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局\" and \"interest rate hikes\" for \"加息,\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly wordy or repetitive phrasing, such as \"through continuous regulatory efforts\" or \"by referring to international standards and best practices.\"\n- The phrase \"still expected to remain challenging\" in some translations is redundant and can be simplified to \"expected to remain challenging.\"\n- The order of \"risks and opportunities\" in some translations is reversed (\"opportunities and risks\"), which may slightly alter the nuance of the original text.\n- Some translations use \"supervisory work\" instead of \"regulatory efforts,\" which is less standard in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more concise and natural phrasing, such as \"ensure banks have sufficient resilience\" instead of \"ensure banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks.\"\n- Maintain the original order of \"risks and opportunities\" to preserve the intended emphasis.\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for brevity and clarity, unless the full name is needed for emphasis or clarity.\n- Avoid redundancy by simplifying expressions like \"still expected to remain challenging\" to \"expected to remain challenging.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the language for greater fluency and naturalness in English.\n---\nGiven the escalation of geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both risks and opportunities for the banking sector. Faced with a rapidly changing financial environment, the HKMA is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient resilience through continuous regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies by referring to international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Supervisory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, focusing on their classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of vulnerable borrowers. The HKMA will also strengthen its surveillance system and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level in the banking system remains under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" plan, while ensuring that customers temporarily facing difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn addition, in response to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will also enhance the regulation of authorized institutions' liquidity positions and market risk management in 2023.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new section on \"Operational Resilience\" in the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in developing their operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cyber resilience by following up on issues identified in the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 assessments and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust tertiary data backup arrangements.\n\nWith the accelerating pace of digitalization, other regulatory priorities of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority include strengthening supervision over banks' third-party risk management and enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking industry.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will prioritize updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) ecosystem to address money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF) risks, and further promoting the development of AML Suptech and Regtech. The HKMA’s \"Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" will also be revised, with specific guidance issued on implementing proportionate measures for politically exposed persons (PEPs), thereby facilitating the industry’s effective and risk-based implementation of key legislative amendments. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of a bank-to-bank information sharing platform, aiming to accelerate the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account abuse, and strengthen protection for victims of fraud while assisting them in recovering their losses. The HKMA will also further focus on promoting the adoption of Regtech (including data analytics) through the \"AML Regtech Lab\" and other AML Regtech initiatives, striving to develop macro analytics capability to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. Through the implementation of these measures, the HKMA will be able to respond more swiftly to systemic ML\/TF risks such as mule account networks and flexibly address evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. It correctly uses \"Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" and \"environmental, social and governance (ESG)\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" which slightly changes the structure of the original sentence, making it slightly less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has several issues. It uses \"investment product\" instead of \"investment products\" and \"social and governance\" instead of \"environmental, social and governance (ESG)\"—both of which are incorrect according to the dictionary. It also misplaces the term \"long term insurance products\" and uses \"ESG investment product\" instead of \"ESG investment products.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"ESG investment products\" and \"long-term insurance products.\" However, it omits the term \"sale of\" before \"securities,\" which slightly alters the meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund)\" correctly and includes \"the sale of securities,\" which aligns with the original text. It also uses \"revised international standards\" instead of \"revisions to international standards,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has a few issues. It uses \"scheme\" instead of \"program\" for \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"investment product\" instead of \"investment products\" and \"ESG investment product\" instead of \"ESG investment products.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It correctly uses \"environmental, social and governance (ESG)\" and \"long term insurance products.\" However, it uses \"take into account\" instead of \"refer to,\" which is a minor stylistic difference.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should use \"Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)\" and \"environmental, social and governance (ESG)\" as specified. It should also use \"investment products\" and \"ESG investment products\" in plural form. The phrase \"the sale of securities\" should be included to match the original structure. The term \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" should be used with \"program\" as in the dictionary. Finally, the phrase \"revisions to international standards\" should be used as in the original.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strengthen on-site examinations and offsite reviews of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management and the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. The key focus areas in 2023 will be the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products, and long term insurance products. During this process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" \"regulators\" or \"regulatory authorities\" for \"監管機構,\" and \"AIs\" or \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about the HKMA's role in regulating virtual assets is preserved in all versions.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"AIs\" while others use \"authorized institutions.\" For consistency, it is better to use one term throughout the translation.\n- **\"MPF\" vs. \"mandatory provident fund\":** While \"MPF\" is an acceptable abbreviation, it may not be as clear to all readers. Using the full term \"mandatory provident fund\" is more reader-friendly unless the context clearly indicates that the audience is familiar with the abbreviation.\n- **\"Occupational retirement scheme\" vs. \"mandatory provident fund\":** The original text refers to \"強積金,\" which is the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) in Hong Kong. Using \"occupational retirement scheme\" is less precise and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.\n- **\"Develop\" vs. \"establish\":** Some translations use \"develop\" when referring to the creation of a regulatory framework. \"Establish\" is more precise and commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **\"Coordinate\" vs. \"maintain close communication\":** While \"coordinate\" is a valid synonym, \"maintain close communication\" is more aligned with the original phrasing and better reflects the intent of the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" consistently instead of \"AIs\" to ensure clarity and professionalism.\n- Use \"mandatory provident fund\" instead of \"MPF\" or \"occupational retirement scheme\" for clarity.\n- Use \"establish\" instead of \"develop\" when referring to the creation of a regulatory framework.\n- Use \"maintain close communication\" instead of \"coordinate\" to stay closer to the original wording.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will also maintain close communication with other regulatory authorities and the banking sector, and provide guidance to authorized institutions on the regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and mandatory provident fund products as needed, which will also include guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulatory authorities to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including those applicable to sophisticated investors), and will begin regulating the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with the new sections of the relevant Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) and the new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of Financial Market Infrastructures\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"CPMI,\" \"PFMI,\" and \"IOSCO.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main ideas are well conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate formal language suitable for regulatory or policy documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use alternative names for the same entity (e.g., \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" vs. \"Payment Systems Ordinance\").\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy or repetitive (e.g., \"financial market infrastructures (FMIs)\" is repeated unnecessarily).\n- **Fluency and Readability:** Some translations use awkward phrasing or passive voice that reduces readability (e.g., \"will be assessed\" instead of \"will assess\").\n- **Clarity of Intent:** Some translations obscure the intent of the original text by using vague or ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"refer to the latest international standards\" vs. \"assess in light of the latest international standards\").\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Use the exact terms from the dictionary, such as \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO)\" and \"Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI).\"\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use active voice and concise phrasing to enhance readability.\n- **Fluency and Natural Flow:** Ensure that the translation reads smoothly and naturally in English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its supervision in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), and the guidelines issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). The HKMA will assess each infrastructure in light of the latest international standards as needed. It will participate in the CPMI and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)'s monitoring and evaluation programs for the implementation of the PFMI, engage with international standard-setting bodies, and strengthen its supervisory requirements in line with international practices or in response to developments in markets and technology. Additionally, where necessary, the HKMA will collaborate with relevant authorities to further enhance cooperative supervisory arrangements.\n\n# Formulate Policy\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the tone of official policy statements. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in style and formality that can be refined.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"in line with.\" The translation is accurate and fluent. However, \"in line with\" is slightly less formal than \"in accordance with,\" which is often used in official contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"in line with.\" The only difference is the use of \"optimize\" instead of \"improve.\" Both are acceptable, but \"optimize\" may imply a more technical or strategic adjustment, which may or may not align with the original intent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"in line with.\" This is more formal and appropriate for official documents. However, the use of \"its\" adds a possessive that is not in the original sentence, which may be unnecessary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"in line with.\" This is very similar to the first translation, with the only difference being the use of \"optimize\" instead of \"improve.\" As with the second translation, this may be a matter of style.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"in line with.\" This is the most formal and complete version, but again, the possessive \"its\" is not in the original and may be redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"in accordance with.\" This is the most formal and precise phrasing, as \"in accordance with\" is commonly used in legal and regulatory contexts. It is slightly more formal than \"in line with.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should balance formality, accuracy, and clarity. \"HKMA\" is the preferred abbreviation in most contexts, especially in international or regulatory discussions. \"In accordance with\" is more formal and precise than \"in line with,\" which is appropriate for a statement about regulatory compliance. The use of \"optimize\" is slightly more technical and may be more appropriate than \"improve\" in the context of regulatory frameworks. However, \"strengthen and improve\" is also acceptable and may be more commonly used in such contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and improve the banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing the Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary specifications. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Basel III,\" \"industry consultation,\" and \"Legislative Council.\"\n- The structure of the original text is preserved in all translations, maintaining the bullet points and logical flow.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain a formal tone suitable for regulatory documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** incorrectly uses \"negative vetting\" instead of \"first reading\" or \"pre-legislative consultation,\" which is not a standard term in the legislative process.\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 3** use \"first reading\" and \"pre-legislative consultation\" correctly, but \"first reading\" is more commonly used in the context of legislative procedures.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"positive neutral countercyclical capital buffer\" with lowercase \"positive,\" which should be capitalized as per the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"prior scrutiny and approval procedure,\" which is slightly wordy and less standard than \"pre-legislative consultation.\"\n- **Translation 6** correctly capitalizes \"Positive Neutral Countercyclical Capital Buffer\" and uses \"pre-legislative consultation.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the most standard and commonly accepted terms in regulatory and legislative contexts.\n- It should maintain consistency in terminology, especially for terms like \"Positive Neutral Countercyclical Capital Buffer\" and \"pre-legislative consultation.\"\n- The translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and avoid unnecessary wordiness.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of the most accurate translations while ensuring consistency and clarity.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA will further optimize the capital framework by implementing standards recently issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, including:\n- The December 2017 \"Basel III: Finalising Post-crisis Reforms,\" the January 2019 (revised in February 2019) \"Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk,\" and the July 2020 \"Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework\" — these revised capital standards, collectively referred to as the final reform package of Basel III, outline new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduce the output floor requirement, as well as optimize the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) to implement the aforementioned requirements and the Positive Neutral Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative consultation during the same year and will not take effect before January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.\n- The December 2022 \"Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures.\" The HKMA plans to implement the relevant standards locally on January 1, 2025, in accordance with the Basel Committee's timeline, and intends to consult the industry on related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Exposure Limits\n\nIn March 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules. These proposed amendments were primarily introduced in response to the HKMA's implementation of revised capital standards under the final reform package of Basel III mentioned above. The consultation document also included other corresponding amendments regarding the treatment of sovereign concentration risk under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the final reform package of Basel III (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (BLAR 2023),\" and \"Basel III.\" However, some translations use \"the Capital Rules\" without specifying \"Banking (Capital) Rules\" or similar, which may be less precise. The term \"Capital Rules\" is not in the dictionary, so it is acceptable, but clarity could be improved.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some suffer from awkward phrasing. For example, \"made in response to the proposed amendments to the Capital Rules at the same time\" is slightly redundant. Also, \"the revised Capital Rules under the Basel III final reforms\" is slightly unclear and could be rephrased for clarity.\n3. **Cultural and Technical Appropriateness**: The translations are technically sound and appropriate for a regulatory or financial context. However, the use of \"the credit risk portion\" or \"credit risk component\" is slightly inconsistent. \"Credit risk portion\" is more precise in this context.\n4. **Consistency**: Some translations use \"revisions\" while others use \"amendments.\" While both are acceptable, \"amendments\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts and is more consistent with the original text.\n5. **Clarity of Purpose**: The original text emphasizes that the liquidity rule revisions are made in response to the capital rule revisions. Some translations capture this relationship better than others, particularly in how they link the two sets of rules.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (BLAR 2023). These amendments are made in response to the proposed amendments to the Capital Rules at the same time, and therefore the target implementation date for BLAR 2023 will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the final Basel III reforms (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Basel III,\" \"Basel Committee,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Legislative Council,\" \"window-dressing,\" and \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points—such as the Basel Committee's publications, the HKMA's role, and the timeline for legislative submission—are well preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"revised capital standards,\" \"disclosure requirements,\" and \"pre-legislative consultation.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Third Pillar 1\" instead of \"Pillar 3,\" which is not a standard term in Basel III literature. The correct term is \"Third Pillar.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are overly literal or awkward in phrasing, such as \"negative vetting\" or \"affirmative procedure,\" which are not standard terms for the legislative process in Hong Kong.\n- **Clarity of Process:** Some translations use \"pre-enactment consultation\" or \"pre-legislative scrutiny,\" which are acceptable, but \"pre-legislative consultation\" is more commonly used in Hong Kong legislative contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the Basel Committee also issued\" or \"the HKMA is also preparing.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use standard terminology, such as \"Third Pillar\" instead of \"Third Pillar 1.\"\n- Use the correct legislative process term: \"pre-legislative consultation.\"\n- Maintain clarity and fluency without unnecessary repetition.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of dictionary terms and avoid non-standard or ambiguous terms like \"negative vetting\" or \"affirmative procedure.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards under the final reform package of Basel III are primarily set out in the Basel Committee’s \"Third Pillar Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" issued in December 2018, and \"Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements,\" issued in November 2021. The Basel Committee also issued \"Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements\" in June 2019 to address concerns about potential \"window-dressing\" (referring to banks reducing the volume of certain transactions before or after the reporting date in order to artificially increase the reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratio). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the HKMA is also preparing corresponding revisions to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is consulting with the industry during the process. It is expected that the revised Disclosure Rules will be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative consultation together with the revised Capital Rules within 2023.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month expected credit

However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"central banking institution,\" \"statutory mandate,\" and \"corporate governance.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the message.\n- The use of terms like \"maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence\" is appropriate and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Corporate Governance\" with a capital \"C,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry that lists it in lowercase. While \"Corporate Governance\" is a proper noun in some contexts, in this sentence, it refers to a general concept and should be lowercase unless it is a specific program or framework.\n- The phrase \"fulfillment of its statutory mandate\" is used in some translations, while others use \"its statutory mandate.\" The latter is more concise and natural in this context.\n- The use of \"sound governance\" in one translation is slightly different from the original's \"good governance,\" though it is not incorrect.\n- Some translations use \"has therefore consistently strived\" while others use \"has therefore always been committed\" or \"has consistently strived.\" The latter is more direct and commonly used in formal writing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the capitalization of \"corporate governance.\"\n- Use \"its statutory mandate\" instead of \"the HKMA's fulfillment of its statutory mandate\" for conciseness.\n- Maintain a consistent and natural tone throughout the translation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most natural and accurate elements from the junior translators' work, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and fluency in English.\n**Final Translation:**\nAs Hong Kong's central banking institution, the HKMA fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its statutory mandate, and has therefore consistently strived to uphold a high level of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:  \n- has established a clear and highly accountable governance structure;  \n- has implemented comprehensive and robust controls to manage risks and ensure that the behavior of all staff and their daily operations meet specified standards; and  \n- adheres to transparent and open policies, maintaining close contact with all stakeholders.\n\n# HKMA and The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" and \"HKSAR\" as per the dictionary. However, \"公職人員\" is consistently translated as \"public officers,\" which is correct. The term \"金融管理專員\" is translated as \"Monetary Authority\" in all translations, which is acceptable but could be more precise. The term \"轉授\" is translated as \"delegation\" in all translations, which is correct.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some phrases are awkward or repetitive. For example, \"terms of employment different from those of civil servants\" (Translation 1) is less natural than \"terms of employment different from those of public officers\" (Translation 2). Also, \"conferred or delegation\" (Translation 6) is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"conferred or delegated.\"\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use formal and official language suitable for government documents.\n4. **Nuance and Precision**: Some translations use \"talent\" (Translation 2) or \"personnel\" (Translation 5) instead of \"individuals\" or \"people,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise. The phrase \"highly autonomous\" is used in most translations, which is appropriate, but \"enjoy a high degree of autonomy\" (Translation 5) is more natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement**: The best translation should maintain consistency with the dictionary, use natural and fluent English, and accurately reflect the nuances of the original text. It should avoid grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. Based on these considerations, the improved translation should incorporate the best elements from the junior translations while ensuring grammatical correctness and fluency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), but it can employ staff under terms of employment different from those of public officers to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The HKMA's day-to-day operations enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the scope of statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of the dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"it was specified that the Currency Board arrangements should be used to maintain Monetary Stability\" is slightly awkward. Also, \"keeping the HKD exchange value at approximately 7.80 HKD to 1 US dollar\" is slightly redundant, as \"HKD\" is already mentioned.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is concise and grammatically sound. However, it uses \"monetary policy objective\" (singular) instead of \"objectives\" (plural), which may not align with the original text's plural form. Also, the phrase \"the exchange value of the HKD at around 7.80 HKD to 1 US dollar\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"instruments\" instead of \"tools,\" which is a minor variation. The phrase \"keeping the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar at approximately 7.80 HKD to 1 US dollar\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"monetary policy objective\" (singular), which may not match the original's plural form. The phrase \"keeping the exchange value of the HKD at approximately 7.80 HKD to 1 US dollar\" is slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKD per US dollar\" instead of \"HKD to 1 US dollar,\" which is more natural. It also uses \"stipulated\" instead of \"specified,\" which is a more formal and appropriate term in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKD per 1 US dollar,\" which is slightly more natural than \"HKD to 1 US dollar.\" However, it uses \"monetary policy objective\" (singular), which may not match the original's plural form.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"monetary policy objective\" should be plural (\"objectives\") to match the original text.\n- The phrase \"keeping the exchange value of the HKD at approximately 7.80 HKD to 1 US dollar\" can be improved to \"keeping the exchange value of the HKD at approximately 7.80 HKD per US dollar\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- The use of \"stipulated\" is more formal and appropriate in this context than \"specified\" or \"stated.\"\n- The term \"instruments\" is a valid alternative to \"tools,\" but \"tools\" is more commonly used in monetary policy contexts.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter to the Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, the Financial Secretary stipulated that Monetary Stability should be maintained through Currency Board arrangements, keeping the exchange value of the HKD at approximately 7.80 HKD per US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and operational means, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"legal tender notes and coins,\" \"FMI,\" \"clearing and settlement systems,\" and \"market development initiatives.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall fluency and precision of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and maintain a formal tone appropriate for official policy documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different verbs, such as \"implementing policies\" versus \"responsible for policies,\" which can subtly change the nuance.\n- There is variation in the use of \"efficient\" versus \"effective\" in describing the banking system's operation.\n- Some translations use \"financial infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI,\" which is not ideal since \"FMI\" is a standard acronym in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"being responsible for operating those systems\" in Translation 3 is slightly wordy compared to \"operating such systems\" in others.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FMI\" consistently as the dictionary specifies, rather than \"financial infrastructure.\"\n- Use \"implementing these policies\" to maintain parallel structure with the introductory clause.\n- Use \"efficient operation\" for consistency with the original Chinese term.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"operating such systems\" is used for clarity and conciseness.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use the dictionary terms accurately, and ensure consistency in verb usage and phrasing.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority's responsibilities include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of FMI through the development of clearing and settlement systems, and operating such systems where appropriate; and\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to promote confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text accurately. However, they vary in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of appropriate terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"delegated authority granted by the Financial Secretary\" and \"be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\" The use of \"management and investment\" is slightly repetitive but acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"operation and investment management\" which is slightly more precise than \"management and investment.\" The phrase \"according to the delegated authority granted by the Financial Secretary\" is well-structured.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"based on the delegated authority from the Financial Secretary,\" which is slightly less formal than \"granted by\" but still acceptable. The phrase \"must be accountable\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the third, but uses \"acting under the delegated authority granted by the Financial Secretary,\" which is slightly more formal and precise. The use of \"must be responsible\" is slightly less formal than \"must be accountable.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is the most precise in terms of legal terminology. It uses \"deployment and investment management\" instead of \"management and investment,\" which is more specific. The phrase \"according to the delegated authority conferred by the Financial Secretary\" is more formal and appropriate in a legal context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is concise and accurate, but it omits \"granted by\" in \"based on the delegated authority,\" which slightly weakens the clarity of the source of the authority. It is still understandable but less precise than the others.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use precise legal terminology. It should also reflect the formal tone of the original text. The fifth junior translator's version is the most precise in terms of terminology, using \"deployment and investment management\" and \"conferred by.\" However, \"deployment\" may not be the most commonly used term in this context. \"Management and investment\" is more standard in financial contexts. The first and second translations are also strong, with the second using \"operation and investment management,\" which is slightly more precise.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the operation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, according to the delegated authority granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the HKMA's autonomy in daily operations and policy implementation, while underscoring its accountability and transparency. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, structure, and word choice.\nStrengths across the translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and the accurate translation of \"政策目標\" as \"policy objectives.\" Most translations also convey the idea of autonomy, accountability, and transparency effectively.\nHowever, some translations are more verbose or less fluent. For example, the second and sixth translations use \"the methods it employs\" and \"the methods employed,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly wordy. The third and fifth translations use \"In terms of the methods used in daily operations,\" which is more concise and natural. The first and fourth translations use \"in its day-to-day operations and implementing policy objectives,\" which is fluent and concise.\nThe phrase \"while also being supported by high accountability and transparency\" (used in translations 2, 4, and 6) is slightly less direct than \"while simultaneously ensuring high accountability and transparency\" (used in translation 3) or \"supported by a strong sense of accountability and transparency\" (used in translation 5). The latter options are more idiomatic in English.\nThe best translation would combine fluency, conciseness, and natural phrasing, using \"HKMA\" for brevity and clarity, and ensuring that the sentence flows smoothly.\nThe HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and the methods used to implement policy objectives, while simultaneously ensuring high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe original text is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) outlining its mission and objectives. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"官方儲備\" as \"official reserves,\" and \"金管局\" as either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- The core message is preserved in all translations, including the HKMA's commitment to banking stability, managing reserves, developing financial infrastructure, and supporting Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and economic development.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Banking Stability\" as a standalone term, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"銀行體系穩定\" (banking system stability). It also uses \"financial infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI,\" which is not in the dictionary.\n- **Translation 2** correctly uses \"FMI\" for \"金融基建\" but uses \"banking system stability\" instead of \"banking stability,\" which is less concise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Banking Stability\" and \"FMI\" correctly but omits \"monetary\" in the first part of the sentence, making it slightly less comprehensive.\n- **Translation 4** is fluent and uses \"FMI\" correctly. It also uses \"overseeing\" instead of \"monitoring,\" which is a minor stylistic choice.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Banking Stability\" and \"FMI\" correctly but uses \"supervising\" instead of \"monitoring\" and \"sound\" instead of \"robust,\" which are acceptable but not the most precise in this context.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"financial infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI,\" which is not in the dictionary, and \"sound\" instead of \"robust,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the primary term for \"金管局\" for brevity and consistency.\n- Use \"banking system stability\" for \"銀行體系穩定\" to be more precise.\n- Use \"FMI\" for \"金融基建\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"robust\" instead of \"sound\" or \"strong\" for consistency with the original tone.\n- Use \"monitoring\" or \"overseeing\" for \"監察\" depending on the nuance, but \"monitoring\" is more standard in this context.\n- Ensure that \"monetary\" is included in the phrase \"monetary and banking system stability\" to reflect the full scope of the HKMA's mission.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to promoting monetary and banking system stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring a robust and diversified FMI, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"media outlets\" is used appropriately for \"媒體\" in all translations.\n- The core message of the original text is preserved in all versions, including the need for public trust, the HKMA's rigorous approach, and its use of traditional and social media to clarify misinformation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"timely clarifies\" which is slightly less formal than \"promptly clarifies\" or \"in a timely manner.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"inaccurate information\" instead of \"false information,\" which is slightly less precise in the context of misinformation.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"widely concerned by society,\" which is awkward phrasing compared to \"of public concern.\"\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal version, using \"in a timely manner\" and \"fall within the HKMA’s purview,\" which is more precise than \"scope of responsibilities.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, which is more formal but slightly less concise than \"HKMA.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"highly concerned by society,\" which is awkward and less idiomatic than \"of public concern.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency.\n- Use \"false information\" to match the nuance of \"失實資訊.\"\n- Use \"in a timely manner\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Use \"fall within the HKMA’s purview\" for precision.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing such as \"widely concerned by society\" or \"highly concerned by society.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would combine the best elements of the translations while ensuring fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the HKMA must gain the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and strives to address matters of public concern that fall within its purview. In particular, the HKMA clarifies false information and rumors regarding its policies through traditional and social media outlets in a timely manner.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Translation**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Legislative Council\" as per the dictionary. However, the phrase \"taking into account statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality, and confidential information\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is very similar to the first, with minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"powers\" instead of \"authority\" in the second sentence, which is acceptable. The phrase \"statutory restrictions on the disclosure of commercial confidentiality and confidential information\" is slightly better structured than in the first translation.\n3. **Third Translation**: This version is well-written and uses \"HKMA\" consistently. It uses \"community\" instead of \"public\" in one instance, which is slightly less precise. The phrase \"as far as possible, while taking into account market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality, and statutory restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information\" is a bit wordy.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in full on first mention, which is good for clarity. However, the phrase \"statutory restrictions on the disclosure of commercial confidentiality, confidential information, and market sensitivity\" is slightly out of order compared to the original text.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This version is well-structured and uses \"HKMA\" consistently. It uses \"to the extent possible\" which is a slightly more formal and precise phrasing than \"as far as possible.\" However, the phrase \"To ensure that the HKMA is aware of public sentiment\" is slightly less precise than \"to ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is very strong, with clear and natural phrasing. It uses \"financial industry\" instead of \"financial sector,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"subject to statutory restrictions regarding the disclosure of market sensitivities, commercial confidentiality and confidential information\" is well-structured and precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should also maintain the original tone and intent of the text. Based on the above review, the **sixth translation** is the strongest, with only minor adjustments needed for consistency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, as the HKMA’s powers are established by legislation passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also understands that it has a broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor issues of public concern. In carrying out its day-to-day work and maintaining extensive engagement with the community, the HKMA is committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial industry and the public are as fully informed as possible about the HKMA’s work, subject to statutory restrictions regarding the disclosure of market sensitivities, commercial confidentiality and confidential information; and\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in style and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"regular and special publications,\" \"social media platforms,\" and \"Corporate Functions.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and clarity that can be refined for maximum fluency and precision.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure that mirrors the original Chinese text.\n- Proper use of formal and professional language appropriate for an official institution like the HKMA.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use slightly redundant phrasing, such as \"maintaining extensive contact with the media, and publishing...\" which can be streamlined.\n- The phrase \"a wealth of publications\" or \"a large number of publications\" is repeated in several translations; \"a large collection of HKMA-published publications\" is more precise.\n- The term \"information centre\" is used in some translations, while others use \"information center.\" The correct spelling in English is \"information center.\"\n- The phrase \"for visits and use\" is repeated in several translations and can be simplified to \"for visits and use\" or \"for public visits and use.\"\nAfter reviewing the translations, the best approach is to combine the strengths of all versions while eliminating redundancy and ensuring clarity and fluency. The final translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use the correct dictionary terms, and ensure that the structure is natural and easy to read in English.\nFinal Translation:\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency, maintaining extensive contact with the media, and publishing a variety of regular and special publications in both Chinese and English. HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a large collection of HKMA-published publications, press releases, speeches, and presentations. In addition, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. Details on the HKMA’s work in communicating and engaging with the public can be found in the \"Corporate Functions\" chapter (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in tone, formality, and precision that can be refined for optimal clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts,\" and \"Special Data Dissemination Standard.\"\n- Accurate rendering of the timeline and key events (e.g., 1999 participation in the IMF program, 1996 website launch).\n- Consistent use of formal and professional language appropriate for the subject matter.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"carried\" or \"featured\" to describe the website content, which is acceptable but less precise than \"has provided\" or \"has published.\"\n- The phrase \"banking sector regulatory policies and guidelines\" is repeated in some translations, which is correct but could be streamlined for conciseness.\n- The use of \"initiative\" in some translations (e.g., \"Special Data Dissemination Standard initiative\") is slightly less precise than \"program\" or \"standard\" alone, as the term \"initiative\" may imply a more voluntary or less formal effort.\n- The phrase \"progressively increased\" is used in several translations, which is correct but \"gradually increased\" or \"steadily increased\" may be more natural in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use precise terminology, and ensure clarity and conciseness.\nThe HKMA has gradually increased the frequency of publishing Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts data, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund’s central banking \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" program in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on Currency Board operations. Since 1996, the HKMA website has provided banking sector regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council\" correctly and accurately conveys the frequency of briefings. However, \"operations and policies\" is slightly less precise than \"work and policies\" or \"operations and policies\" depending on context.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"related queries\" instead of \"inquiries,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal. The phrase \"from time to time\" is more natural than \"regularly\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is clear and accurate. It uses \"explain and discuss specific issues\" effectively. However, \"draft legislation\" is slightly more formal than \"draft bills\" or \"draft legislation,\" which may be appropriate depending on the intended audience.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate but slightly wordy. It includes \"and its sub-committees\" which is not explicitly stated in the original text. The phrase \"providing briefings\" is slightly less direct than \"briefing.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"pledged\" instead of \"committed,\" which is a slight variation in tone but still appropriate. The phrase \"various committees\" is slightly vague and not directly supported by the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is concise and grammatically correct. It uses \"Legislative Council committee meetings\" effectively. However, it omits the phrase \"of the Legislative Council\" after \"Panel on Financial Affairs,\" which may be necessary for clarity.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency with official usage.\n- \"財經事務委員會\" should be translated as \"Panel on Financial Affairs\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"事務委員會及小組委員會會議\" should be translated as \"committee meetings\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"金管局總裁\" should be translated as \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" for clarity and formality.\n- \"議員\" should be translated as \"Members\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would combine the clarity and formality of the first and third translations, while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and avoiding unnecessary elaboration.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has committed to briefing the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA's various work and policies, and to answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives regularly attend committee meetings of the Legislative Council to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist Members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" \"Internal and external control mechanisms\" for \"內部及外部監控機制,\" and \"Internal and external audit functions\" for \"內部及外部審計職能.\"\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n- The use of synonyms such as \"sound,\" \"robust,\" and \"effective\" is appropriate and conveys the intended meaning of \"穩健有效的.\"\n- The phrase \"checks and balances\" is consistently used, which is a well-established term in governance and risk management contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"employee conduct\" while others use \"employee integrity\" or \"staff integrity.\" While all are acceptable, \"employee conduct\" is more neutral and commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- The phrase \"ensure adherence to high standards\" (used in translations 3 and 6) is slightly more formal than \"ensure high standards of,\" which is more direct and commonly used in official statements.\n- The use of \"monitoring mechanisms\" in translation 2 is incorrect; the original text refers to \"control mechanisms,\" which is specified in the dictionary.\n- The prepositions \"on whether\" (translation 4) and \"of whether\" (others) are both acceptable, but \"of whether\" is more standard in formal writing.\n- The use of \"adequate\" (translations 4 and 5) is slightly less precise than \"sufficient\" in the context of regulatory mechanisms.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the standard abbreviation for \"金管局\" in formal contexts.\n- Use \"employee conduct\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"ensure high standards of\" for directness and common usage.\n- Use \"control mechanisms\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"of whether\" for grammatical correctness in formal writing.\n- Maintain the structure and flow of the original text while ensuring clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective internal and external control mechanisms to ensure high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of whether the control mechanisms are sufficient and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, and the junior translators have generally captured its meaning accurately. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA Code of Conduct\" for 《行為守則》 and \"ethical and legal responsibilities\" for 道德與法律責任, as required by the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentence is largely consistent across translations, with the main clause being \"provides guidance on... ensuring that...\"\n- Most translations use \"employees\" or \"staff\" appropriately to refer to all levels of personnel.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the conduct of all staff at all levels conforms to specified standards.\" While grammatically correct, \"conforms to\" is slightly less common in this context than \"meets\" or \"complies with.\"\n- The third translation uses \"the conduct of all levels of staff,\" which is awkward phrasing. \"All levels of staff\" is not idiomatic in English; \"all staff at all levels\" is more natural.\n- The fourth and fifth translations use \"behavior\" instead of \"conduct.\" While both words are acceptable, \"conduct\" is more formal and better suited to a document like a code of conduct.\n- The sixth translation is the most consistent and natural in phrasing, using \"employees\" and \"behavior\" appropriately, though \"behavior\" is slightly less formal than \"conduct.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Conduct\" is more formal and precise in the context of a code of conduct.\n- \"Employees\" is more specific than \"staff\" and better aligns with the original term 員工.\n- \"Meets the specified standards\" is more natural and commonly used than \"conforms to\" or \"complies with\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"at all levels\" should be placed after \"employees\" for clarity and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees at all levels meets the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks in their work processes and establishing appropriate controls to ensure the smooth daily operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the entity level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Risk Committee,\" \"controls,\" and \"mitigating strategies.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the process described.\n- The use of \"determines appropriate follow-up actions\" is consistent across most translations, which is a natural and professional phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"by various departments\" instead of \"identified by various departments,\" which slightly weakens the clarity of the subject performing the identification.\n- The second and fifth translations are very similar and are among the most fluent and natural-sounding.\n- The third translation uses \"the adequacy of related controls,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than \"whether the related controls are adequate.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"sufficient\" instead of \"adequate,\" which is a valid synonym but slightly less formal in a corporate or regulatory context.\n- The sixth translation uses \"assesses whether the related controls and mitigating strategies are sufficient,\" which is slightly more passive and less direct than the other versions.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best version should maintain clarity, use formal and professional language, and ensure that the subject performing the actions is clear. The phrase \"identified by various departments\" is more precise than \"by various departments.\" Also, \"adequate\" is more commonly used in formal risk management contexts than \"sufficient.\" The use of \"determines\" is more active and direct than \"assesses\" or \"with the committee determining.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related controls and mitigating strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is simply the title \"# 內部審計,\" which translates directly to \"Internal Audit.\" All junior translators have provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization. The first, second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Internal Audit\" with proper capitalization, while the third and fifth use \"internal audit\" with lowercase letters. The fourth and sixth translations also include the \"#\" symbol, which appears to be a formatting choice rather than part of the actual term.\nThe most appropriate translation would be \"Internal Audit\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is a standard title and does not require special formatting unless specified by the context. The use of proper capitalization is also more appropriate for a formal title. Therefore, the best translation is \"Internal Audit.\"\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of governance procedures, risk management, and controls across different departments, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nAccording to section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Exchange Fund Financial Statements are audited by the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge for this service. The audited Exchange Fund Financial Statements are published in the HKMA Annual Report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、境外分行及境外主要附屬公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13

Environment\n\nFacing the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightened financial conditions, and a challenging external environment, Hong Kong's economy significantly contracted in 2022. The labor market remained weak for some time before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also faced pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between Mainland and Hong Kong, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022 amid various adverse factors in both local and external environments (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, private consumption sharply declined in the first quarter due to the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Subsequently, private consumption recorded a quarterly increase as social distancing measures were gradually relaxed and supported by the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme. Under weak business sentiment and tightening financial conditions, overall investment expenditure fell significantly compared to 2021. Externally, weakening external demand, combined with disruptions in cross-boundary land transportation between Mainland and Hong Kong, led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Service exports remained largely weak, partly reflecting the subdued inbound tourism activities, but conditions improved somewhat in the fourth quarter following the government’s removal of compulsory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real GDP. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\nFigure 1: Contributions to the Growth of Real Gross Domestic Product  \nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\nFigure 1 shows the contribution to real GDP growth.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nFigure 1: Contribution to the Growth of Real gross domestic product by Sector  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines, but there are variations in style and fluency. The first, second, and third translations are very similar and are the most concise and natural. The fourth translation uses \"Contributions\" (plural) and \"Real Gross Domestic Product\" (full form), which is correct but slightly more verbose. The fifth translation is grammatically incorrect as it uses a full sentence (\"Figure 1 shows...\") instead of a label. The sixth translation introduces \"by Sector,\" which is not present in the original text and is therefore inaccurate.\nThe best approach is to use the most concise and natural phrasing while ensuring that the term \"實質本地生產總值\" is translated as \"Real GDP\" (as it is the most commonly used and concise form). Also, the source should be translated as \"Census and Statistics Department\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Growth of Real Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: The quarter-on-quarter changes in seasonally adjusted gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflationary pressure slightly increased in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the year-on-year core inflation rate gradually rose to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of high external energy and food prices partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, particularly soft housing rentals (Figure 2). Furthermore, under weak economic activity, nominal wage growth and commercial rentals continued to remain soft, which also helped to curb inflation. For the full year of 2022, the core and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\nLocal inflationary pressure slightly increased in 2022 but remained moderate.

For the full year of 2022, the core and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"labour force,\" \"labour force participation rate,\" and \"private sector vacancies.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the timeline of the labor market changes, the unemployment rate fluctuations, and the context of the pandemic.\n- The use of \"private sector vacancies\" is consistent across all translations, which is crucial for maintaining the intended meaning.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, and the flow of information is logical and clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"labor\" instead of \"labour,\" which is acceptable but less formal and less commonly used in academic or official contexts.\n- The phrase \"the labour force decreased slightly by 1.5% year-on-year in December\" (used in Translation 1) is slightly awkward compared to \"the labour force was slightly lower by 1.5% in December\" (used in Translation 4), which is more natural.\n- The use of \"rebounded\" in some translations (e.g., Translation 1 and 5) is slightly more dramatic than necessary, while \"increased\" or \"rose\" might be more neutral and appropriate in this context.\n- The phrase \"annual growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated\" (Translation 3) is slightly more precise than \"annual increases... also slightly accelerated\" (Translation 6), though both are acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"labour\" consistently for a more formal tone, as it is the preferred term in British English and often used in economic reports.\n- Use \"rose\" or \"increased\" instead of \"rebounded\" for a more neutral tone.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"the labour force decreased by 1.5% in December\" is phrased clearly and naturally, avoiding redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe labor market situation deteriorated rapidly at the beginning of 2022 under the pandemic, but subsequently continued to improve. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April before significantly declining to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates decreasing across most industries. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector vacancies increased, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. The annual growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, compared to the same period last year, the labour force was slightly lower by 1.5% in December, partly due to a minor decline in the labour force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nData Source: Estimates by Staff of the Census and Statistics Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text contains two key terms that must be translated exactly according to the dictionary: \"政府統計處\" and \"金管局.\" All six translations correctly use \"Census and Statistics Department\" and either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for these terms, which is appropriate.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, the translations are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that affect readability. For instance, the use of \"Figure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\" with a colon is more standard in formal reports than \"Figure 2 Core Consumer Price Inflation\" without a colon. Similarly, \"Data Source\" is more commonly written as \"Data source\" with a lowercase \"s\" unless it is the beginning of a sentence.\nThe term \"基本消費物價通脹\" is translated as either \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" or \"Core Consumer Price Inflation.\" While both are acceptable, \"Core Consumer Price Inflation\" is more commonly used in economic contexts to refer to inflation excluding volatile items like food and energy, making it more precise and natural in this context.\nThe phrase \"資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\" is translated in various ways, such as \"Source: Estimated figures by staff of...\" or \"Data source: Estimates by...\" The most natural and concise phrasing is \"Data Source: Estimates by Staff of the Census and Statistics Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which maintains clarity and formality.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use \"Core Consumer Price Inflation\" for \"基本消費物價通脹,\" include a colon after \"Figure 2,\" and use \"Data Source\" with a lowercase \"s\" followed by a clear and concise attribution of the estimates to the relevant departments and their staff.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Situation  \nData Source: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"local equity market,\" \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"Russia-Ukraine situation,\" \"COVID-19 pandemic,\" \"US rate hikes,\" and \"global economic prospect.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence structure that affect fluency and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"volatility\" instead of \"fluctuations,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"tightening of global financial conditions\" is used in some translations, while others use \"tightened global financial conditions.\" Both are correct, but \"tightening\" is more commonly used in financial writing.\n- The phrase \"the mainland's optimized measures for pandemic prevention and control\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise, such as \"optimized pandemic prevention measures in the mainland.\"\n- Some translations use \"deteriorating global economic outlook\" while others use \"deteriorating global economic prospect.\" Both are acceptable, but \"prospect\" is more precise in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"fluctuations\" consistently for \"波動\" as it is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- Use \"tightening\" instead of \"tightened\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Simplify phrases like \"optimized measures for pandemic prevention and control\" to \"optimized pandemic prevention measures.\"\n- Use \"global economic prospect\" as specified in the dictionary for consistency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe local equity market experienced significant fluctuations in 2022. Following the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022, the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The stock market underwent a significant correction, initially triggered by heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 pandemic, US rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine situation. Subsequently, tightening global financial conditions and the mainland's COVID-19 outbreak led to a deterioration in the global economic prospect, further expanding the market adjustment. The market regained some upward momentum in the last two months of the year, partly supported by the mainland's optimized pandemic prevention measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points by year-end, marking a significant 15.5% decline compared to the end of 2021, continuing its third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nUnder tighter financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market has also come under pressure. House prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), and housing transactions dropped sharply by 39% to 45,050, a new record low. Despite the decline in house prices, housing affordability remains tight. The actual mortgage interest rates rose during the year from about 1.6% to 3.375% to 3.625%, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for mortgage borrowers. The non-residential property markets have also further softened. With high vacancy rates, prices have declined, and rents remain weak.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of cross-boundary travel between Mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s economic growth is expected to rebound from a low base in 2023. Although the slowdown in growth expectations of advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong’s exports of goods, the recovery of the Mainland economy and the lifting of restrictions on cross-boundary land transportation should provide support for the local economy. The full resumption of cross-boundary travel between Mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit Hong Kong’s inbound tourism and other service exports, thereby boosting local business sentiment and capital spending. Private consumption will also further improve as the labor market strengthens. The government forecasts that real GDP will grow significantly throughout 2023, ranging between 3.5% and 5.5%. However, Hong Kong’s economic growth prospects remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and will largely depend on the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate path, the global growth outlook, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but with various factors offsetting each other, it should remain moderate. Although external prices are expected to remain high, the upward momentum of external prices may further weaken due to weakening economic activity in some major economies and easing upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, with the local economy's recovery and improvement in the labor market, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but the relatively soft housing rental market should continue to offset this to some extent. The government forecasts the overall and core inflation rates for 2023 to be 2.9% and 2.5% respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to further improve as local economic activity resumes.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"macroeconomic environment,\" \"bad debt provisions,\" \"net interest income,\" \"fees and commissions,\" \"asset quality,\" \"interest rate hikes,\" and \"liquidity conditions.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"resilient,\" \"managed well,\" and \"handled them well\" effectively conveys the idea that Hong Kong banks \"應付裕如\" (handled challenges well).\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Capitalization and consistency:** Some translations inconsistently capitalize terms like \"Asset quality\" (e.g., in Translation 1), which should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun or title.\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"Liquidity conditions continued to remain ample\" (Translation 1), which is redundant. A more natural phrasing would be \"remained ample.\"\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Phrases like \"faced by the banking system\" (Translation 2) are repetitive and can be simplified to \"faced by the banking system\" or \"increased in the banking system.\"\n- **Tense and clarity:** Some translations use \"led to an increase in banks’ net interest income\" (Translation 3), which is grammatically correct but could be more concise as \"increased net interest income.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of terms not requiring it (e.g., \"asset quality\").\n- Use more concise and natural phrasing to enhance fluency.\n- Avoid redundancy by simplifying phrases like \"faced by the banking system\" to \"in the banking system.\"\n- Ensure that the sentence structure flows smoothly and adheres to natural English grammar and style.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all translations while addressing the noted weaknesses for fluency, grammar, and consistency.\n---\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year, heightened geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major global central banks to address rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks handled them well, maintaining ample capital and liquidity conditions. Credit risks in the banking system increased during the year, but overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. At the same time, rising interest rates increased net interest income, although this positive effect was partially offset by higher bad debt provisions and a decline in fees and commissions income. Overall, profitability of retail banks improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"classified loan ratio,\" \"overdue and rescheduled loan ratio,\" \"Mainland-related lending,\" \"provision coverage ratio,\" \"market value of collateral,\" \"delinquency ratios,\" \"residential mortgage lending,\" and \"credit card lending.\" However, there are slight variations in wording and flow that could be refined for clarity and naturalness.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and logical structure of the sentences.\n- Proper use of financial terminology.\n- Consistent use of figures and references to figures (e.g., Figure 5 and Figure 6).\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"classified loan ratio\" instead of \"specific classified loan ratio,\" which is a minor but important distinction in the original text.\n- The phrase \"the rise in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loan ratings\" is slightly more natural than \"the increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in the credit ratings.\"\n- The phrase \"the provision coverage ratio (i.e. total provisions to classified loans)\" is correctly used in most translations, but the use of \"i.e.\" should be consistent with the dictionary entry, which includes \"i.e. total provisions to classified loans.\"\n- Some translations use \"non-performing loan balance\" instead of \"呆壞帳餘額,\" which is more accurately translated as \"non-performing loan balance\" but could be more precise as \"balance of non-performing loans.\"\n- The phrase \"the bank's provision coverage ratio would be approximately 140%\" is slightly less precise than \"the provision coverage ratio was approximately 140%.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translators while ensuring consistency in terminology, natural phrasing, and precise use of financial terms.\n---\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 2.21% at the end of 2022, also an increase from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The rise in the specific classified loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loan ratings for some property developers in the Mainland. Despite this, banks maintained adequate provisions. As of the end of 2022, the provision coverage ratio (i.e., total provisions to classified loans) remained around 80%. If the market value of collateral is deducted from the balance of non-performing loans, the provision coverage ratio was approximately 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nNote: The figures include the Hong Kong office, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending  \nSource: HKMA\nFigure 6: Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage loans and credit card lending  \nData source: HKMA\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFigure 6: Delinquency Ratios for Residential Mortgage Lending and Credit Card Lending  \nData Source: HKMA\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are minor inconsistencies in formatting, capitalization, and the use of \"Data source\" versus \"Source.\" Additionally, the term \"residential mortgage lending\" appears in one translation, which is acceptable but less common than \"residential mortgage loans\" in this context.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"delinquency ratios,\" \"residential mortgage loans,\" \"credit card lending,\" and \"HKMA.\"\n- The structure of the titles is consistent, with most using \"Figure 6: Delinquency Ratios of...\" which is appropriate for a chart or graph title.\n- The use of \"Source: HKMA\" is standard and appropriate.\nWeaknesses:\n- Inconsistencies in capitalization: \"Delinquency ratios\" (lowercase) vs. \"Delinquency Ratios\" (title case).\n- One translation uses \"Data source\" instead of \"Source,\" which is less concise and slightly less standard in this context.\n- One translation uses \"residential mortgage lending\" instead of \"residential mortgage loans,\" which is acceptable but less common in financial contexts.\nImprovements:\n- Standardize the title case: \"Delinquency Ratios\" should be capitalized as it is the title of a chart.\n- Use \"Source: HKMA\" consistently.\n- Prefer \"residential mortgage loans\" over \"residential mortgage lending\" for clarity and consistency with financial terminology.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use title case for the chart title, maintain consistency in the use of \"Source,\" and use the most common financial terminology.\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"aggregate pre-tax operating profit,\" \"bad debt provisions,\" \"net interest income,\" \"fees and commissions,\" \"retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio,\" \"foreign exchange and derivatives,\" \"net interest margin,\" \"interest rate hikes,\" \"financial markets,\" and \"derivative overlay portfolios\" (though the latter term is not used in the original text and thus not required). \nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Accurate use of financial terminology.\n- Proper handling of percentages and figures.\n- Clear structure and logical flow of information.\n- Consistent use of terms like \"interest rate hikes\" and \"net interest margin.\"\nWeaknesses include:\n- Minor variations in phrasing, such as \"record profits\" vs. \"generate profits\" vs. \"report profits.\"\n- Some translations use \"revenue\" instead of \"income,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"derivative overlay portfolios\" appears in one translation, but it is not present in the original text and is not required by the dictionary.\n- Some translations use \"set aside special reserves\" while others use \"set aside special provisions,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"provisions\" is more standard in financial contexts.\nImprovements could focus on:\n- Ensuring consistency in terminology (e.g., using \"income\" rather than \"revenue\").\n- Avoiding unnecessary or non-standard terms like \"derivative overlay portfolios.\"\n- Ensuring that the phrase \"set aside special provisions\" is used consistently.\n- Maintaining a neutral and formal tone appropriate for financial reporting.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, consistency, and precision in financial terminology while ensuring natural and fluent English.\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Retail banks’ aggregate pre-tax operating profit increased by 19.0% during the year (Figure 7). The improvement in profits was driven by a 34% increase in net interest income and a 72% rise in income from foreign exchange and derivatives, although some of the gains were offset by a 151% increase in bad debt provisions and a 19% decline in fees and commissions income. In the context of interest rate hikes, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility during the year also led to higher income from foreign exchange and derivatives business for banks. The increase in bad debt provisions was due to the need to set aside special provisions for newly classified loans, while weaker financial market performance led to a decline in fees and commissions income. Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio decreased from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Retail Banks’ Performance  \nSource: HKMA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, consisting of a title and a source citation. The key terms to be translated are “零售銀行的表現” and “金管局,” which must be translated as “retail banks’ performance” and “HKMA” or “Hong Kong Monetary Authority,” respectively.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses “retail banks’ performance” and “HKMA.”  \n   - However, the colon after “Figure 7” is missing, which is standard in formal captions.  \n   - The title lacks capitalization, which is inconsistent with formal English style.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Properly capitalizes “Retail Banks’ Performance.”  \n   - Uses “HKMA” as the source.  \n   - However, the colon after “Figure 7” is missing, and the line break between the title and source is inconsistent with standard formatting.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Uses “retail banks’ performance” and “HKMA.”  \n   - The title lacks capitalization and the colon is missing.  \n   - “Data source” is used instead of “Source,” which is less concise and slightly less formal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly capitalizes the title and uses “Data Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.”  \n   - While “Hong Kong Monetary Authority” is a valid translation of “金管局,” it is more verbose than “HKMA.”  \n   - The use of “Data Source” is slightly more formal than “Source,” which is acceptable but not necessary in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly capitalizes the title and uses “Source: HKMA.”  \n   - The colon after “Figure 7” is present, and the formatting is consistent.  \n   - This is a strong translation with only minor improvements possible.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly capitalizes the title and uses “Data Source: HKMA.”  \n   - The use of “Data Source” is slightly more formal than “Source,” but still acceptable.  \n   - The colon after “Figure 7” is present, and the formatting is consistent.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should maintain consistency with formal English captioning standards, which typically include a colon after “Figure 7,” proper capitalization of the title, and the use of “Source:” rather than “Data Source:” unless the context specifically requires the latter. “HKMA” is the preferred abbreviation for “金管局” in most professional and formal contexts, as it is more concise and widely recognized.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 7: Retail Banks’ Performance  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 8 Retail Banks’ Net Interest Margin  \nSource: HKMA\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms from the dictionary and translated them appropriately. However, there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization that affect the overall fluency and professionalism of the translations.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations use lowercase for \"retail banks’ net interest margin,\" which is less formal and less consistent with standard English conventions for titles and headings. The second and fifth translations capitalize the entire phrase, which is more appropriate for a title. The sixth translation uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the acronym \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less concise.\nThe best approach is to use title case for the heading, as it is more standard in formal contexts, and to use the acronym \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency with the dictionary entry. The phrase \"Source:\" is more commonly used than \"Data source:\" in formal documents, and it is more concise.\nTherefore, the improved translation should be:\nFigure 8 Retail Banks’ Net Interest Margin  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banks’ Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"balance sheet grew,\" \"mark-to-market,\" \"loans for use outside Hong Kong,\" \"trade finance,\" \"Mainland-related lending,\" and \"loans for use in Hong Kong.\" However, there are subtle variations in word choice and sentence structure that affect fluency and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and data.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The sentence structures are mostly clear and grammatically correct.\n- The translations maintain the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"mark-to-market gains on foreign exchange\" (Translation 2) or \"mark-to-market valuation of foreign exchange\" (Translation 6), which could be more naturally phrased as \"mark-to-market values of foreign exchange.\"\n- A few translations use redundant or slightly wordy expressions, such as \"the total loan amount decreased by 3.0%\" (Translation 1) or \"total loans decreased by 3.0%\" (Translation 4), which can be simplified to \"total loans decreased by 3.0%.\"\n- Some translations use \"fell\" or \"dropped\" for \"decreased,\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"decreased\" or \"declined.\"\n- The phrase \"loan demand weakened during the year\" is slightly vague; \"loan demand weakened amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates\" (Translation 5) is more precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent and natural phrasing for financial terms, such as \"mark-to-market values\" instead of \"mark-to-market valuation\" or \"mark-to-market gains.\"\n- Simplify expressions like \"the total loan amount decreased\" to \"total loans decreased.\"\n- Use \"declined\" or \"decreased\" consistently for numerical changes.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is parallel and clear, especially when listing different categories of loans.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe banking system's balance sheet grew by 2.5% in 2022. The increase in assets was due to the rise in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and derivative overlay portfolios. Facing external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to a 3.8% increase in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Loans for use outside Hong Kong decreased by 10.2%, trade finance decreased by 13.5%, while loans for use in Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.9%. Mainland-related lending, which had grown by 3.7% in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the balance sheet, banking system deposits continued to record moderate growth. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2021. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n# Capital Adequacy\nThe original text is a single term, \"資本充足水平,\" which is directly translated as \"Capital adequacy\" according to the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used this translation, with minor formatting differences such as the presence of a \"#\" symbol and capitalization. The most appropriate translation would be \"Capital Adequacy\" with proper capitalization, as it appears to be a heading or title. The \"#\" symbol is likely not necessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement not indicated in the instructions. Therefore, the best translation is \"Capital Adequacy\" without the \"#\" symbol.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"capitalisation,\" \"consolidated total capital ratio,\" \"Tier 1 capital ratio,\" \"locally incorporated authorized institutions,\" and \"Basel III leverage ratio.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable and ensures consistency with the required terminology.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are slight variations in style and word choice that could be refined for greater precision and naturalness in English. For instance, the use of \"Banks\" versus \"The bank\" or \"The banks\" introduces subtle differences in tone and scope. The original text uses \"銀行\" (bank), which is plural in nature, so \"banks\" is more appropriate than \"the bank\" or \"the banks’\" unless referring to a specific entity.\nThe phrase \"remained ample\" is used in several translations, which is correct, but \"maintained ample\" is also acceptable and slightly more active in tone. Additionally, the use of \"well above\" versus \"significantly higher than\" is a matter of style, with \"well above\" being more commonly used in financial contexts to describe compliance with regulatory requirements.\nThe placement of \"at the end of 2022\" also varies slightly, with some translations placing it before the subject and others after. While both are grammatically correct, placing it after the subject tends to flow more naturally in English.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the plural form \"banks\" to match the original, use \"maintained ample\" for a slightly more active tone, and use \"well above\" to align with common financial terminology. The structure should also be streamlined for clarity and natural flow.\nFinal Translation:  \nBanks maintained ample capitalisation in 2022. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio stood at 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System  \nSource: HKMA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, containing two key terms: “存款” (deposits) and “金管局” (HKMA). The dictionary provides exact translations for these terms, and the task is to ensure they are used correctly in the final translation.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 10 Bank System Loans and Deposits\" – The term order is slightly awkward (\"Bank System\" should be \"Banking System\"), and \"Source: HKMA\" is correct.  \n   - **Weakness:** \"Bank System\" is not the standard term in financial contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - \"Loans and deposits of the banking system\" – Correct structure and term usage.  \n   - \"Data source: HKMA\" – \"Data source\" is slightly less common than \"Source\" in captions.  \n   - **Weakness:** \"Data source\" is acceptable but not the most natural phrasing.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - \"Loans and Deposits of the Banking System Source: HKMA\" – Correct structure and term usage.  \n   - **Weakness:** Lack of punctuation between the title and source makes it slightly less readable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Loans and Deposits of the Banking System Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" – Correct in meaning but unnecessarily verbose.  \n   - **Weakness:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the standard abbreviation \"HKMA.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\" – \"In the\" is less precise than \"of the\" in this context.  \n   - **Weakness:** \"In the\" is not the most accurate preposition for this usage.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\" – Same issue as the fifth.  \n   - \"Data Source: HKMA\" – Again, \"Data Source\" is slightly less natural than \"Source.\"\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should use \"Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\" as it is the most natural and standard phrasing in financial contexts. The source should be labeled as \"Source: HKMA\" without the word \"Data,\" as it is more concise and commonly used in captions. The use of \"HKMA\" is preferred over the full name for brevity and consistency with financial terminology.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 11: Consolidated Capital Ratios of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 12: Consolidated Leverage Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary, such as \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),\" \"Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR),\" \"Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR),\" \"Core Funding Ratio (CFR),\" and \"statutory minimum requirements.\" The use of \"customer deposits\" is also consistent across all translations.\nHowever, there are some nuances worth considering for improvement:\n1. **\"Remained stable\" vs. \"remained robust\"**: While \"stable\" is accurate, \"robust\" better captures the original Chinese term \"穩健\" (robust, sound), which implies not just stability but also strength and resilience. This is reflected in translations 1, 5, and 6, which use \"robust,\" while translations 2, 3, and 4 use \"stable.\"\n2. **\"Tier\" vs. \"Category\"**: The original text uses \"第1類機構\" and \"第2類機構,\" which should be translated as \"Category 1 institutions\" and \"Category 2 institutions.\" However, translations 4 and 6 use \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2,\" which is a common term in banking but not explicitly supported by the dictionary. Since the dictionary specifies \"Category,\" it is more appropriate to use \"Category\" rather than \"Tier.\"\n3. **\"Serving as\" vs. \"becoming\"**: The original text uses \"成為...重要支柱\" (\"became an important pillar\"), which is more dynamic than \"serving as.\" However, \"serving as\" is also acceptable and commonly used in formal English. Translations 1, 5, and 6 use \"serving as,\" while translations 2, 3, and 4 use \"becoming.\"\n4. **\"Significantly above\" vs. \"well above\"**: Both are acceptable, but \"significantly above\" is more precise in conveying the degree of excess over the statutory minimum.\n5. **\"At the end of 2022\" vs. \"As of the end of 2022\"**: Both are correct, but \"As of the end of 2022\" is slightly more formal and precise.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would retain the accuracy of the junior translators while refining the language for clarity, formality, and precision.\nThe banking system's liquidity conditions have remained robust, serving as an important pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits remain the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2022, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for Category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratios of Designated AIs  \nSource: HKMA\nThe junior translators have all correctly translated the key terms from the dictionary: \"指定認可機構\" as \"designated AIs,\" \"流動性比率\" as \"Liquidity ratios,\" and \"金管局\" as \"HKMA.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the fluency and consistency of the translations.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use a colon after \"Figure 13\" and capitalize \"Liquidity ratios,\" which is more formal and consistent with standard English conventions for figure captions. The second, third, and fifth translations omit the colon and lowercase \"liquidity ratios,\" which is less formal and slightly inconsistent with standard usage.\nIn terms of \"Data source\" versus \"Source,\" both are acceptable, but \"Source\" is more commonly used in academic and professional contexts for figure captions. Additionally, the use of a colon after \"Figure 13\" and a line break before \"Source\" improves readability and visual structure.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would follow the formal structure with a colon after \"Figure 13,\" capitalize \"Liquidity ratios,\" and use \"Source: HKMA\" for consistency and clarity.\n\nFigure 14: Funding Ratios of Designated AIs  \nSource: HKMA\nThe junior translators have all correctly translated the key terms from the dictionary: \"指定認可機構\" as \"designated AIs,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" and \"資金比率\" as \"Funding ratios.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the fluency and consistency of the translations.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations use \"Figure 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\" without a colon after \"Figure 14,\" which is less formal and less commonly used in academic or official documents. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Figure 14: Funding ratios of designated AIs,\" which is more standard and preferred in formal contexts.\nThe sixth translation includes both \"HKMA\" and the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is redundant since \"HKMA\" is the standard abbreviation used in such contexts. It is more concise and professional to use only \"HKMA\" as the source.\nThe word \"Data source\" is less commonly used than \"Source\" in formal English, and \"Source: HKMA\" is more standard and concise.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use the standard format \"Figure 14: Funding Ratios of Designated AIs\" with a colon after the figure number, proper capitalization, and the standard abbreviation \"HKMA\" as the source. This format is consistent with official and academic writing conventions.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n隨着美國收緊貨幣政策，港元在2022年轉弱，弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息於2022年內逐步上升。整體而言，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2022 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受到本港股市調整、市場預期美國進一步加息，以及在香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息的負息差下的套息交易帶動，港元在2022年初轉弱，並在其後的月份一直貼近弱方兌換保證水平。弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強（圖1）。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2022年全年繼續運作正常。\n\n為應付銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2022年初增發總值400億港元的外匯基金票據。此外，金管局在2022年5月至11月間按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率水平共買入2,421億港元。總結餘由2021年底的3,775億港元，減少至2022年底的963億港元，反映增發外匯基金票據，以及弱方兌換保證被觸發的影響。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在年內由11,488億港元，稍增至12,004億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2021年底的15,263 億港元，減少至 2022 年底的 12,967 億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖1 2022年市場匯率\n\n圖2 2022年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國在2022年持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息逐步上升（圖3）。全年計，隔夜、1個月及3個月香港銀行同業拆息分別上升318、419及473基點至年底時的3.23厘、4.35厘及4.99厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調，基本利率上調7次，合共4.25個百分點（即425基點），由0.5厘上升至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國上調政策利率，多間銀行在9月下旬調高最優惠貸款利率12.5基點，在11月初再調高25基點，以及在12月中再調高25基點。部分銀行亦於年內提高以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的新批按揭利率上限。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2021年的68億港元增至2022年的84億港元。\n\n圖3 2022 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n接近40年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大的應對挑戰的能力。儘管2022年全球金融狀況反覆，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織在《2022年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2022年在109.3%至111.0%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報110.1%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2022年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2022年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括中國內地物業市況、非銀行機構在住宅按揭市場的角色、深度學習在信用風險評估上的應用，以及一個用作評估港元流動性的監察框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n金管局繼續舉辦講座，為銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖的收銀員及學生講解香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵，提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。在2022年，金管局共舉辦15場講座，吸引4,200多名參加者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。為應對銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求及考慮到市場情況，金管局在2022年首兩個月增發總計400億港元外匯基金票據，而總結餘亦因此相應減少。截至2022年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為12,075億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心 完成3份政策研究報告、發表24份研究論文及舉辦16場研討會╱網上研討會，內容涵蓋對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題。研究中心亦作出進一步安排，透過全新的開放取用電子期刊發布研究結果，令更廣泛的讀者接收到相關資訊。此外，研究中心在其網站推出全新系列刊物《Insights from Monetary Research Digest》， 為公眾總結研究中心最近的研究成果，提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究成果外，研究中心亦舉辦兩場國際研討會及3場網上專家研討會，促進對經濟及金融事務的對話與交流：\n\n-

tightening of U.S. monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened in 2022, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered 41 times between May and November. Driven by increased turnover in the local equity market and year-end seasonal funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) generally followed the trend of U.S. dollar interbank offered rates. Due to continued U.S. interest rate hikes, HIBOR gradually rose throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong exchange and money markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly transactions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Base,\" \"Currency Board arrangements,\" \"US dollar reserves,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat terms unnecessarily, such as \"exchange value\" and \"exchange rate\" interchangeably, which can confuse the reader.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** A few translations have awkward phrasing, such as \"keeping the exchange value of the HKD against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per 1 US dollar,\" which is grammatically correct but could be more concise.\n- **Consistency in Capitalization:** Some translations inconsistently capitalize terms like \"Monetary Base\" and \"monetary base,\" which should be standardized.\n- **Clarity of Meaning:** A few translations use phrases like \"matching the change in the Monetary Base by 100 percent,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"matching 100% of the changes in the Monetary Base.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"exchange rate\" consistently where appropriate, as it is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"exchange value.\"\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of terms like \"Monetary Base\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- Simplify and streamline sentences to enhance fluency and readability.\n- Use precise and concise phrasing, such as \"maintaining a 100% correlation\" or \"fully matching the changes.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain Monetary Stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate, keeping it within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts Currency Board arrangements, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support for the Monetary Base; any changes in the Monetary Base must be accompanied by corresponding adjustments in the US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% correlation with fluctuations in the Monetary Base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full support for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued currency notes and coins;  \n- The Aggregate Balance (i.e., the total clearing account balances held at the HKMA); and  \n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Aggregate Balance,\" \"Convertibility Undertakings,\" \"HKD,\" \"exchange value,\" and \"Convertibility Zone.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"exchange rate\" instead of \"exchange value\" as specified in the dictionary, which is a minor but important deviation.\n- **Translation 2** and **3** use \"exchange value\" correctly but have minor grammatical issues, such as \"Convertibility Undertaking\" (singular) when the original refers to \"Convertibility Undertakings\" (plural).\n- **Translation 4** uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the abbreviation \"HKMA\" and \"Hong Kong dollar\" instead of \"HKD,\" which is less concise and not in line with the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly uses \"Automatic Exchange Rate Adjustment Mechanism\" instead of \"automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism\" and refers to \"Convertibility Undertakings\" (plural) when the original uses \"Convertibility Undertaking\" (singular).\n- **Translation 6** uses \"exchange rate\" instead of \"exchange value\" and includes \"HKD per USD\" at the end, which is redundant and not in the original.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the dictionary terms exactly as specified.\n- It should maintain the formal and precise tone of the original text.\n- It should ensure grammatical accuracy and fluency in English.\n- It should avoid redundancy and unnecessary elaboration.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the HKD exchange value through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the Convertibility Undertakings. When the strong (or weak) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, at the request of banks, sell HKD and buy US dollars at a rate of 7.75 HKD per US dollar (or buy HKD and sell US dollars at a rate of 7.85 HKD per US dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, causing the HKD interest rate to fall (or rise), and thus prompting the HKD exchange value to return to the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HIBOR,\" \"LIBOR,\" \"carry trades,\" \"local equity market,\" \"interest rate hikes,\" \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU),\" and \"HKD.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, clarity, and flow that can be refined for maximum readability and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\n- The use of \"carry trades,\" \"HIBOR,\" \"LIBOR,\" and \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU)\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n- The mention of \"Figure 1\" and the overall conclusion about the normal operation of the foreign exchange market are well preserved across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive phrasing, such as \"driven by\" or \"due to\" multiple times, which can reduce readability.\n- The phrase \"seasonal funding demand at year-end\" is used in several translations, but \"seasonal funding demand towards the end of the year\" may be more natural in formal writing.\n- The term \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU)\" is introduced in some translations with the full term first, followed by the abbreviation, which is appropriate but could be standardized for consistency.\n- Some translations use \"rebound in local equity market turnover\" or \"increased trading activity,\" which are slightly different in nuance but not incorrect.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a consistent structure for introducing the \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU)\"—either always using the full term first or the abbreviation first.\n- Vary the introductory phrases (e.g., \"due to,\" \"affected by,\" \"driven by\") to avoid repetition.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"seasonal funding demand\" is consistently phrased for clarity and flow.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone throughout, as the text is about financial market operations.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong dollar (HKD) weakened in early 2022, driven by adjustments in the local equity market, market expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes, and carry trades fueled by the negative interest rate differential between Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) and London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). The HKD remained close to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) level throughout the subsequent months, with the weak-side CU being triggered 41 times between May and November. With increased trading activity in the local equity market and seasonal funding demand towards the end of the year, the HKD began to strengthen from mid-November (see Figure 1). Overall, the HKD foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund paper, the HKMA issued an additional HK$400 billion worth of Exchange Fund paper at the beginning of 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion at the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) exchange rate level in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), as requested by banks. The Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper and the activation of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. Meanwhile, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) increased slightly from HK$11,488 billion to HK$12,004 billion during the year. As a result, the combined total of the Aggregate Balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) decreased from HK$15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall Monetary Base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1 2022 Market Exchange Value\nThe junior translators have all correctly used \"exchange value\" for \"匯率\" as specified in the dictionary. However, there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that affect the fluency and readability of the translations.\nThe first and third translations are identical and use a simple format: \"Figure 1 2022 Market Exchange Value.\" This is concise and clear, but lacks a colon or punctuation to separate the label from the title, which is common in formal figures.\nThe second translation, \"Figure 1 Market Exchange Value in 2022,\" reorders the time reference, which is slightly less direct than the original Chinese structure. While still correct, it may not be as immediately clear in terms of temporal context.\nThe fourth translation is identical to the third, so it shares the same strengths and weaknesses.\nThe fifth and sixth translations use a colon: \"Figure 1: 2022 market exchange value.\" This format is more standard in formal writing and provides a clearer separation between the figure label and the title. However, the use of lowercase \"market exchange value\" is inconsistent with the capitalization of the first word in a title, which is typically capitalized in formal contexts.\nThe best possible translation would follow the standard format for figure labels, using a colon to separate the label from the title, and capitalize the first letter of the title. It should also maintain the original order of the time reference for clarity and consistency with the original Chinese text.\n\nFigure 2: 2022 Aggregate Balance (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Money Markets\n\nUnder the LERS, HIBOR generally follows the trend of US dollar interbank offered rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes in the United States in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). For the year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the increase in the target range of the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (i.e., 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail front, following the US's increase in policy rates, several banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by a further 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the upper limit for new mortgage interest rates based on HIBOR during the year. Overall, Hong Kong's money markets continued to operate normally. Discount Window lending increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3 2022 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a title: \"圖3 2022 年香港銀行同業拆息,\" which translates to \"Figure 3 2022 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates.\" The key term \"香港銀行同業拆息\" must be translated using one of the two options provided in the dictionary: \"HIBOR\" or \"Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates.\"\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 3 2022 HIBOR\" – This is concise and uses the acronym, which is appropriate in financial contexts. However, it omits the full term, which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 3 HIBOR\" – This is overly brief and omits both the year and the full term, making it unclear and incomplete.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 3: 2022 HIBOR\" – This adds a colon, which is stylistically inconsistent with standard figure labeling in English. It also omits the full term.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2022\" – This is grammatically correct and includes the full term, but the phrase \"in 2022\" is unnecessarily wordy and disrupts the title's conciseness.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 3 2022 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\" – This is the most accurate and natural translation. It includes the full term, the year, and follows standard title formatting without unnecessary prepositions or punctuation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 3 2022 HIBOR\" – This is concise and uses the acronym, but it lacks the full term, which may be less informative for some readers.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be both accurate and natural. While \"HIBOR\" is a widely recognized acronym in financial contexts, using the full term \"Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\" ensures clarity for all readers, including those unfamiliar with the acronym. Additionally, the placement of the year \"2022\" directly after \"Figure 3\" is standard in English titles and maintains a clean, professional appearance.\nTherefore, the most appropriate translation is: **\"Figure 3 2022 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates.\"** This version is grammatically correct, culturally appropriate, and fully conveys the meaning of the original Chinese title.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in the face of challenges. Despite the volatile global financial conditions in 2022, the HKD exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in the External Sector Report 2022 that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the LERS.\n\nA robust banking system plays a crucial role in the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). The Hong Kong banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity positions and capitalisation well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience against shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress-test results, while maintaining oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the Monetary Base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the LERS, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the HKD exchange value. The Exchange Fund’s substantial fiscal resources, combined with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, provide a strong backstop for ensuring Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Backing Ratio in 2022\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with minor variations in word choice and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Currency Board Sub-Committee,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"HKMA,\" \"liquidity positions,\" and \"monitoring framework.\" However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and clarity that can be refined for maximum precision and natural English flow.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Currency Board Sub-Committee\" as the body responsible for monitoring and discussing monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n- The use of \"non-bank institutions,\" \"residential mortgage market,\" and \"Mainland China property market conditions\" is consistent and accurate.\n- The term \"HKMA\" is used appropriately in all translations, and the reference to the HKMA website is clear.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"examined\" or \"explored\" instead of \"discussed,\" which may slightly alter the nuance of the original text. The original uses \"探討,\" which is more aligned with \"discussed\" or \"examined\" but not \"explored.\"\n- The phrase \"submitted to it\" in some translations is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for smoother reading.\n- The use of \"used to assess\" in one translation is slightly wordy compared to \"for assessing.\"\n- The placement of \"submitted by the HKMA\" in some translations is slightly ambiguous, though not incorrect.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"discussed\" or \"examined\" consistently with the original term \"探討.\"\n- Ensure clarity in the relationship between the HKMA and the Currency Board Sub-Committee, particularly in the phrase \"submitted by the HKMA to the Committee.\"\n- Use more concise phrasing, such as \"for assessing\" instead of \"used to assess.\"\n- Ensure that the flow of the sentence is natural and avoids redundancy.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining the phrasing for natural English flow and precision.\n---\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the Currency Board Sub-Committee discussed topics including property market conditions in Mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing HKD liquidity positions. Meeting minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee and reports on Currency Board operations submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n# Paper Currency and Coins\nPaper money and coins.\nPaper Money and Coins\n# Paper Money and Coins\nBanknotes and coins\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with minor differences in formatting and word choice. The term \"紙幣\" is translated as either \"paper money\" or \"banknotes,\" both of which are acceptable. \"硬幣\" is consistently translated as \"coins,\" which is appropriate. The use of a hashtag (#) in some translations is stylistic and does not affect the accuracy of the translation.\n\"Paper money\" is more commonly used in everyday language, while \"banknotes\" is more formal and often used in financial contexts. Given the lack of specific context, \"paper money\" is a safe and natural choice. The use of a hashtag in some translations is optional and may depend on the intended use of the translation (e.g., for headings, tags, or social media).\nThe most consistent and natural translation is \"Paper Money and Coins,\" which is used by the first, fourth, and fifth translators. It is concise, clear, and appropriate for general use. The translation \"Banknotes and coins\" is also accurate but slightly more formal.\nConsidering fluency, clarity, and general applicability, \"Paper Money and Coins\" is the best choice. It is simple, direct, and widely understood.\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in terminology, fluency, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The key message—that the HKMA hosts seminars to educate various groups about Hong Kong banknotes—is consistently conveyed.\n- The numerical data (15 seminars, 4,200 participants) is accurately translated in all versions.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"lectures\" instead of \"seminars,\" which is less common in formal contexts related to financial education. \"Seminars\" is more appropriate here.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes\" or \"identifying genuine currency,\" which are slightly repetitive or less concise. A more natural phrasing would be \"improving their ability to identify genuine banknotes.\"\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"organized\" or \"conducted\" instead of \"held,\" which is less standard in this context. \"Held\" is more neutral and commonly used for events like seminars.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"bank counter staff\" is slightly more formal than \"bank tellers,\" but both are acceptable. However, \"bank tellers\" is more commonly used in English-speaking financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"seminars\" consistently, as it is the most natural and widely accepted term in this context.\n- Use \"held\" as the verb for organizing seminars, as it is standard and neutral.\n- Use \"improving their ability to identify genuine banknotes\" for a more concise and natural expression.\n- Ensure that \"HKMA\" is used consistently unless the full name is needed for clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to hold seminars to educate bank tellers, retail store cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, improving their ability to identify genuine banknotes. In 2022, the HKMA held a total of 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe original text is concise and formal, and the junior translators have generally produced accurate translations. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and tone that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Coin Collection Programme,\" \"Sustainability Report 2022,\" and \"Sustainable HKMA.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, maintaining the formal tone appropriate for a report or official document.\n- The use of \"popular with the public\" or \"well-received by the public\" is appropriate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The phrase \"among citizens\" in the fifth translation is less natural than \"among the public\" or \"with the public\" in this context.\n- The use of \"are included\" or \"are featured\" is acceptable, but \"can be found\" is more commonly used in formal documents to guide the reader to information.\n- The use of quotation marks and apostrophes varies slightly, but this is a minor stylistic choice and does not affect meaning.\n**Improvements:**\n- \"Popular with the public\" is slightly more natural than \"popular among the public\" in this context.\n- \"Can be found\" is more reader-friendly and commonly used in formal writing to direct the reader to information.\n- Consistency in punctuation (e.g., using double quotation marks) is preferable for a formal document.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Coin Collection Programme continues to be popular with the public. Details of the programme can be found in the “Sustainable HKMA” chapter of the Sustainability Report 2022.\nThe Coin Collection Programme continues to be popular with the public. Details of the programme can be found in the “Sustainable HKMA” chapter of the Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe original text discusses the smooth operation of the EFBN Programme, the issuance of Exchange Fund paper by the HKMA in response to sustained bank demand and market conditions, and the resulting reduction in Aggregate Balance, concluding with the nominal amount of outstanding EFBNs as of the end of 2022.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, with correct use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"40 billion HKD\" is incorrect—it should be \"400 billion HKD\" as per the original text. Also, \"12,075 billion HKD\" is an error; the correct figure is \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation correctly uses \"40 billion HKD\" but incorrectly translates \"外匯基金票據\" as \"Exchange Fund papers\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" or \"EFBNs.\" Also, the figure \"120.75 billion HKD\" is incorrect; it should be \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly states \"400 billion HKD\" instead of \"40 billion HKD\" and also incorrectly uses \"12,075 billion HKD\" instead of \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\" The term \"Exchange Fund paper\" is used consistently, but \"EFBNs\" would be more appropriate in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate in terms of grammar and vocabulary. It correctly uses \"40 billion HKD\" and \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\" However, it uses \"Exchange Fund paper\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" or \"EFBNs,\" which is less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of figures and uses \"EFBN\" correctly. However, it uses \"outstanding nominal amount of EFBN\" instead of \"nominal amount of outstanding EFBNs,\" which is slightly awkward phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the most accurate in terms of both terminology and figures. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" and \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\" However, it uses \"EFBN Programme\" consistently, which is correct, but \"EFBNs\" might be more appropriate in the final sentence.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"EFBN Programme\" and \"EFBNs\" consistently.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" or \"EFBNs\" for \"外匯基金票據及債券.\"\n- Use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"\n- Use \"Aggregate Balance\" for \"總結餘.\"\n- Use \"nominal amount\" for \"名義總值.\"\n- Use \"HKD\" for \"港元.\"\n- Correctly translate the figures: \"40 billion HKD\" and \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and taking into account market conditions, the HKMA issued a total of HKD 40 billion in Exchange Fund Bills and Notes during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the Aggregate Balance. As of the end of 2022, the nominal amount of outstanding EFBNs was approximately HKD 1,207.5 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key term \"外匯基金票據及債券\" and translated it using one of the three acceptable alternatives from the dictionary: \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" or \"EFBNs.\" The translations are largely consistent, with only minor variations in formatting (e.g., use of a colon in Translation 4 and 5).\nTranslation 1, 2, 6 use the full phrase \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes,\" which is more descriptive and may be preferable in formal or official contexts where clarity is essential. Translations 4 and 5 use the acronym \"EFBNs,\" which is more concise and may be preferred in contexts where space is limited or the term has been previously defined.\nTranslation 3 is identical to Translation 1 and 2, so it offers no new insight.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are correct and natural in English. The use of \"Outstanding\" before the term is appropriate, as it conveys the meaning of \"未償還\" (unpaid or outstanding) accurately.\nConsidering the context of the original text, which appears to be a formal or financial document, the full phrase \"Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\" may be more appropriate for clarity and professionalism. However, if the document has already introduced the acronym \"EFBNs\" earlier, then using the acronym would be more efficient.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be:\n**Table 2 Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes**\n\n# Currency Research\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with minor variations in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"policy studies,\" \"working papers,\" \"open-access electronic journal,\" and \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone, structure, and clarity that can be refined for maximum fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the proper terms from the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent and grammatically sound.\n- The translations effectively convey the key information: the number of reports, papers, and events, the strategic importance of the research, and the new publication initiatives.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"making the information accessible to a broader audience\" or \"enabling a broader audience to access relevant information.\" These are correct but could be more concise.\n- The use of \"hosted\" or \"held\" for \"舉辦\" is acceptable, but \"organized\" is more formal and commonly used in academic or institutional contexts.\n- The phrase \"high-level, non-technical summaries\" is repeated across translations and is accurate, but could be slightly rephrased for variety or clarity.\n- Some translations use \"disseminate\" or \"publish\" interchangeably, which is acceptable but may lack precision depending on context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"organized\" for \"舉辦\" to maintain a formal tone.\n- Use \"disseminate\" or \"publish\" depending on the nuance of the original text.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"HKIMR\" and \"the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Use \"summarizing the Institute's recent research findings\" rather than \"summarizing the center's recent research findings\" to maintain consistency with the full name of the institution.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) completed three policy studies, published 24 working papers, and organized 16 seminars\/webinars covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. HKIMR further arranged for the dissemination of research findings through a new open-access electronic journal, making relevant information accessible to a broader audience. In addition, HKIMR launched a new series on its website titled \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest,\" providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of the Institute's recent research outcomes.\n\nIn addition to research findings, the HKIMR also hosted two international seminars and three online expert forums to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial matters.\n\nOn April 12, a webinar titled \"Macroeconomic Developments, Fed Tightening, and Offshore RMB Market Development\" was jointly organized with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF). The event featured Mr. Yam Chi-kwong, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean of the National School of Development at Peking University and the K.C. Wong Economics Professor. The webinar was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 real-time online viewers.\n\nA webinar on “The Transformation and Policy Choices of China’s Property Sector” was held on June 24, featuring Dr. Qin Hong, Senior Researcher at Renmin University of China and former Director of the Policy Research Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a guest speaker. The webinar was hosted by Dr. Wang Tao, Division Head of UBS Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist. The webinar attracted nearly 1.13 million real-time online views from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world.\n\nOn August 25, an online workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillovers\" was jointly organized with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, with over 200 experts from central banking, international financial institutions, and academia around the world participating online.\n\nAs an external event of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, an online seminar titled \"Inflation in the Aftermath of COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was jointly organized with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on November 2. Dr. Quilin Huang, founder and chief economist of International Monetary Monitor Ltd, and former chief economist of Invesco, provided analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated online in the seminar.\n\nOn November 23, the 12th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy was held, with the theme \"Next Phase of China’s Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges and Director of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech on China's short-term and long-term economic prospects at the conference. In addition, four chief economists from different investment banks in the Greater China region shared their views on China's COVID policy, real estate market development, supply chain reshuffle, and longer-term growth prospects during a panel discussion session. The conference attracted over 1.18 million real-time online viewers.\n"}

目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

the macroeconomic environment being filled with uncertainties and challenges, plus abnormal fluctuations in financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system maintained stability in 2022. During the year, the HKMA also strengthened regulatory oversight over credit and market risk management for authorized institutions. In addition, given that cyber threats continue to increase and the pace of digital transformation in the banking sector is accelerating, the HKMA closely collaborated with authorized institutions to enhance the operational and cyber resilience of authorized institutions.\nDespite the macroeconomic environment being filled with uncertainties and challenges, plus abnormal fluctuations in financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system maintained stability in 2022. During the year, the HKMA also strengthened regulatory oversight over credit and market risk management for authorized institutions. In addition, given that cyber threats continue to increase and the pace of digital transformation in the banking sector is accelerating, the HKMA closely collaborated with authorized institutions to enhance the operational and cyber resilience of authorized institutions.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six junior translations are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. However, there are several areas for improvement:\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: While all translations correctly use the dictionary terms, some translations use \"MCRAs\" (Multiple Credit Reference Agencies) inconsistently. For example, Translation 3 includes \"MCRAs\" in parentheses, which may be unnecessary unless the acronym is being introduced for the first time.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Most translations are grammatically sound, but some have minor issues. For instance, Translation 4 uses \"investment product\" instead of \"investment products\" (singular vs. plural), and Translation 2 uses \"develop a regulatory framework\" instead of \"establish a regulatory framework,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial and regulatory terminology that is commonly used in English-speaking regulatory contexts.\n4. **Clarity and Nuance**: The phrase \"rolling bad apples\" is a metaphor for recurring issues or bad actors, and all translations capture this nuance effectively. However, some translations use \"launched\" or \"introduced\" interchangeably, which is acceptable but could be more precise.\n5. **Structure and Flow**: The structure of the sentences is consistent across translations, but some translations use slightly more formal or less fluid phrasing, such as \"help customers restart their bank accounts\" versus \"allow customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain consistency in terminology, use precise and natural phrasing, and ensure clarity and fluency throughout.\n---\nIn terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection for \"Pay Later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. The HKMA also collaborated with other regulatory authorities to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory regime for trust business. During the year, the \"Credit Reference Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Reference Agencies\" model for consumer credit data was launched, along with a new Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon. Additionally, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in introducing convenient measures to help customers restart their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has worked with banks through public-private partnerships (including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce) to strengthen Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) ecosystem and enhance efforts to combat fraud. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage risks and instabilities arising from the increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA has also further promoted the industry's use of data and technology through its \"AML Regtech Lab\" series, while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of suptech in its AML work. In international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nIn 2022, good progress was made locally in the implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively enhanced the industry's soft infrastructure, including cooperating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pool and improving the skills of existing practitioners. Throughout the year, the HKMA maintained close collaboration with the banking industry to improve and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Grammar and Syntax**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some use slightly awkward phrasing. For example, \"strive to advance its work\" (Translation 1) is more verbose than necessary. \"Continue to advance work\" (Translation 3) is more concise and natural.\n2. **Word Choice and Fluency**: The use of \"strive to advance\" (Translation 1) and \"dedicate efforts to advancing\" (Translation 6) is somewhat wordy. \"Continue to advance\" (Translation 3) is more direct and fluent. \"Specific initiatives\" (Translations 2, 4, 5) is more natural than \"specific work\" (Translations 1, 3, 6), as it better reflects the proactive nature of the actions described.\n3. **Consistency with Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"resolution regime,\" \"loss-absorbing capacity resources,\" and \"domestic systemically important banks.\" However, some translations use \"formulating new resolution standard\" (Translation 3, 6) instead of \"resolution standards,\" which is a singular\/plural error. This should be corrected to \"resolution standards.\"\n4. **Prepositions and Articles**: Some translations use \"at all domestic systemically important banks\" (Translation 3) instead of \"across all domestic systemically important banks\" (Translations 4, 5), which is more natural in this context. Also, \"conducting a regional crisis simulation exercise\" (Translation 3, 6) uses the article \"a\" unnecessarily, as the exercise is a specific, defined activity.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use formal and professional language suitable for a government or regulatory body like the HKMA.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime. Specific initiatives include developing new resolution standards; conducting regional crisis simulation exercises; and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources across all domestic systemically important banks, marking a milestone in enhancing resolvability.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal requires establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly collapses. As the regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks and recovering from crises to return to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent collapses. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority aims to ensure that, in the event an authorized institution is no longer viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution regime, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove barriers to resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s operational capabilities to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the above work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts an internationally consistent and coordinated approach.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency with the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"FMIs\" or \"financial market infrastructures\" for \"金融市場基建\" and \"HKMA\" for \"金管局.\" However, \"Monetary Authority\" is used for \"金融管理專員,\" which is technically correct but less precise than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in context, as the role described is specifically that of the HKMA.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. For example, the first and sixth translations use smoother phrasing and more natural sentence structures. The second and third translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"prevent disruptions to their stability\" versus \"prevent potential impacts on their stability.\"\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The use of \"safeguard\" and \"prevent potential impacts\" are both acceptable, but \"safeguard\" is more commonly used in regulatory and financial contexts. \"Resilience\" is appropriately used in all translations to convey \"抗震能力.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial terminology and maintain the formal tone expected in regulatory documents.\n**Improvements to Consider**:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for \"金管局\" to avoid ambiguity.\n- Use \"FMIs\" for \"金融市場基建\" to maintain consistency with financial regulatory terminology.\n- Use \"safeguard\" rather than \"prevent potential impacts\" for a more natural and precise expression.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is varied and avoids repetition of phrases like \"financial market infrastructures.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary terms and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and supervising certain FMIs. The HKMA supervises FMIs with the aim of promoting the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructures, controlling systemic risks, and enhancing transparency. Enhancing the resilience of FMIs can safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems and prevent potential impacts on their stability due to disruptions in their operations.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nThis year, the HKMA approved six overseas trading platforms to become money brokers, while five licensed banks and one restricted licence bank had their authorization revoked.\n\nFor more information on authorized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 283 to 286 and 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA conducted a total of 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including the CAMEL rating assessment of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of fintech. To continue strengthening the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors of authorized institutions, and conducted 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations of authorized institutions' various businesses. From the perspective of prudential supervision, the management of credit risk is one of the key regulatory focuses. At the same time, as the use of technology by banks becomes increasingly widespread, operational risk and technology risk management are another key regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also conducted a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA carries out on-site examinations of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses, complemented by thematic reviews to examine areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"資產質素\" as \"asset quality,\" which matches the dictionary entry. The translations are largely consistent, with only minor differences in formatting and capitalization. The first, second, third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English. The fourth translation uses \"Loan growth\" instead of \"Credit growth,\" which is a less accurate translation of \"信貸增長\" — \"credit growth\" is the more precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.\nThe best translation is \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality,\" as it is both accurate and natural in English. It maintains the original structure and terminology while adhering to standard financial English conventions.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Mainland-related lending\" and \"HKD.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data points (percentages, years, and figures) are accurately represented.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology such as \"loans and advances\" and \"growth figures.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly translates \"45,220億港元\" as \"45,220 billion HKD,\" which is a massive overstatement. The correct value is \"452.2 billion HKD\" (45,220 billion is 45.22 trillion, which is implausible in this context).\n- **Translation 4** misplaces the phrase \"also decreasing by 4.4% in 2022\" and omits the year in the first sentence, which could confuse the reader about the timeline.\n- **Translation 1, 2, 5, and 6** are very similar and mostly fluent, but **Translation 6** uses \"Total loans\" instead of \"The total loan amount,\" which is slightly less precise but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"growth situation\" instead of \"growth figures\" or \"growth of,\" which is less idiomatic in financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that numerical values are correctly converted and formatted (e.g., \"45,220億港元\" should be \"HKD 452.2 billion\").\n- Use consistent phrasing such as \"The total loan amount\" or \"Total loans\" depending on the desired tone.\n- Maintain clarity in sentence structure, especially when presenting data over multiple years.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as repeating \"also decreased by 4.4% in 2022\" in the same sentence.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe total loan amount decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances. The total Mainland-related lending also decreased by 4.4% to HKD 452.2 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and tense usage. All translations correctly incorporate the dictionary terms \"加息\" as \"interest rate hikes\" and \"房地產發展商\" as \"property developers.\" Below is a critical review of each translation:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"within the year\" is slightly formal but acceptable. The phrase \"financial conditions\" is correctly used, and the sentence structure is clear.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"this year\" instead of \"within the year.\" The use of \"has remained\" is slightly more present-oriented, which is acceptable but slightly less neutral than the simple past tense.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate. The use of \"during the year\" is slightly more natural than \"within the year.\" The phrase \"worsening financial conditions\" is slightly more vivid than \"deteriorating financial conditions,\" but both are acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"banking sector\" instead of \"banking system,\" which is a minor variation but still accurate. The phrase \"the deteriorating financial condition\" uses the singular \"condition\" instead of the plural \"conditions,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"Throughout the year\" instead of \"Within the year.\" The use of \"remained\" is consistent with the original tense and is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"the fifth wave of the pandemic\" is slightly more concise than \"the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" but both are acceptable. The phrase \"the deterioration of financial conditions\" is slightly more formal than \"deteriorating financial conditions,\" but still correct.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should maintain a neutral and formal tone, consistent with the original text. It should use the correct tense and avoid unnecessary variations in phrasing. The phrase \"banking system\" is more consistent with the original than \"banking sector.\" The use of \"deteriorating financial conditions\" is more natural and consistent with the original. The phrase \"Throughout the year\" is slightly more natural than \"Within the year\" or \"During the year.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThroughout the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various sources, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland property developers. Despite these various challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"asset quality,\" \"classified loan ratio,\" and \"Mainland-related lending.\" However, there are subtle variations in prepositions, articles, and verb usage that affect fluency and precision.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and straightforward sentence structures.\n- Proper numerical and temporal expressions (e.g., \"at the end of 2022,\" \"a year earlier\").\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The first and sixth translations use \"up from\" and \"increased from,\" which are both acceptable, but \"rose from\" and \"increased from\" are slightly more formal and precise in financial contexts.\n- The fourth and fifth translations use \"within the year\" and \"the banking industry,\" which are slightly less standard than \"during the year\" and \"the banking sector.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"mainland-related lending\" with a lowercase \"m,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry and should be capitalized as \"Mainland-related lending.\"\nThe best translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the second, third, and fifth translations while incorporating the most natural and standard financial terminology.\nImproved Translation:\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The classified loan ratio for the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, higher than 0.89% at the end of 2021. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA has enhanced the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to assess the economic and market situation, as well as the risk management measures of the authorized institutions in a timely manner. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The results of the HKMA's solvency stress tests show that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers and can withstand extreme stress.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"thematic reviews\" and \"risk commitments in vulnerable industries,\" which are acceptable. However, \"risk commitments\" is not a standard term in financial risk management, and \"in vulnerable industries\" is slightly less precise than \"to more vulnerable industries.\"\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"Focused Review\" (singular), which is inconsistent with the original text that refers to \"專題評估\" in the plural, suggesting multiple reviews. It also uses \"risk commitments to more vulnerable industries,\" which is more precise than \"in.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the best version, using \"thematic reviews\" and \"risk commitments to more vulnerable industries.\" It is fluent and grammatically sound.\n4. **Translation 4** is similar to 3 but uses \"sectors that are more vulnerable,\" which is slightly more wordy than \"more vulnerable industries.\"\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"Focused Review\" (singular) and \"Commitments\" in uppercase, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase requirement. It also uses \"overseas branches\" instead of \"branches outside Hong Kong,\" which is less precise.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"Focused Review\" (singular), \"Commitments\" in uppercase, and \"mortgage loans\" instead of \"secured loans,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term \"有抵押貸款.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nBased on the above review, the best translation should use \"thematic reviews\" (plural), \"risk commitments to more vulnerable industries,\" and \"secured loans.\" It should also use \"branches outside Hong Kong\" and ensure that all dictionary terms are translated correctly and consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA conducted thematic reviews during the year to examine the management of credit risk by authorized institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk commitments to more vulnerable industries, credit risk at branches outside Hong Kong, and secured loans provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the other hand, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of enterprises are facing financial difficulties. The HKMA encourages authorized institutions to handle cases where enterprises encounter repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles outlined in the Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties, thereby enabling individual authorized institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the relevant lending institutions.\n\nTable 3 Mainland-related Lending Growth\n\n# Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressure\n\nConsidering the six translations provided, several observations can be made regarding their strengths and weaknesses. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism,\" \"partial principal repayment arrangement,\" and \"COVID-19 pandemic.\" However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and contextual appropriateness.\nThe first junior translator uses \"fifth wave\" correctly, which aligns with the original text. However, \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" is slightly ambiguous and could be more precise. The second junior translator mistakenly refers to the \"second wave\" instead of the \"fifth wave,\" which is a critical error. The third junior translator uses \"pre-approved principal and interest moratorium,\" which is not an exact match for the original term \"預先批核還息不還本\" and may mislead readers. The fourth junior translator uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" and \"resuming normal repayments in the long term,\" which is slightly less precise than the original. The fifth junior translator adds \"(without principal repayment)\" to the term, which is redundant and not in the dictionary. The sixth junior translator uses \"pre-approved principal and interest repayment suspension,\" which is not an exact match and may be confusing.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are generally well-structured, but some use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"resuming normal repayments in the long term\" or \"return to normal repayment schedules.\" The most accurate and fluent translation is the first one, but it could be improved by using more precise terminology and ensuring clarity.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"fifth wave\" as in the original.\n- Use \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" as the most accurate and concise term.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments\" is used consistently and clearly.\n- Avoid adding redundant or non-dictionary terms.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nTaking into account the impact of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continued complexity and volatility of both external and Hong Kong's economic outlook, the HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, has extended the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme until July 31, 2023. In addition, the scheme has introduced and subsequently optimized a partial principal repayment arrangement to help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks approved over 108,000 cases of loan tenor extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving an amount exceeding HKD 1.1 trillion. For individual customers, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only payments and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount exceeding HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Lending\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio,\" \"HKMA,\" \"debt servicing ratio (DSR),\" \"residential mortgage loans,\" and \"countercyclical macroprudential measures.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and clarity that can be refined for maximum precision and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message and data points from the original text.\n- The use of the dictionary terms is consistent and correct across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the logical flow of the original text.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly more formal or less natural phrasing, such as \"enhanced banks' risk management capabilities\" (fifth translation) or \"the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system to a potential reversal\" (fourth translation), which, while correct, could be more concise.\n- The phrase \"newly approved residential mortgage loans\" (third and sixth translations) is slightly more precise than \"new residential mortgage loans\" used in others, but both are acceptable.\n- The use of \"ceiling\" (sixth translation) versus \"cap\" (others) is interchangeable, but \"cap\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"introduced\" more frequently than \"launched\" or \"implemented,\" which may vary in tone but are all acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- To enhance fluency and naturalness, the translation should use concise and commonly used financial terminology.\n- The phrase \"resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market\" is slightly more natural than \"resilience to a potential reversal\" or \"resilience against a potential downturn.\"\n- The use of \"newly approved\" instead of \"new\" may be preferable for clarity, as it emphasizes that the data refers to recently approved loans.\n- The phrase \"average debt servicing ratio (DSR) for new mortgages has remained at a low level\" is slightly more natural than \"remained at a low level, at 39% in December 2022.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures since 2009, which have strengthened banks' risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the DSR cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly applies the dictionary terms. However, \"the trend of mortgage rates and their historical long-term average\" is slightly awkward compared to more natural phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"stress-testing of property mortgage lending\" which is slightly more natural than \"for stress-testing of property mortgage lending.\" It also uses \"compared to their historical long-term average,\" which is more precise than \"their long-term average.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"stress-testing property mortgage lending\" which is slightly more concise than \"for stress-testing of property mortgage lending.\" However, \"their long-term average levels\" is slightly wordy compared to \"their historical long-term average.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The use of \"Stress-testing\" with a capital \"S\" is inconsistent with the dictionary entry, which lists \"Stress-testing\" as a lowercase term. Also, \"their historical long-term averages\" is slightly less precise than \"their historical long-term average.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"upward adjustment\" instead of \"assumed increase,\" which is a minor but meaningful deviation from the original. It also uses \"its historical long-term average level\" which is grammatically incorrect (should be \"their\" not \"its\").\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very strong. It uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" at the beginning, which is appropriate for clarity. It also uses \"compared to their historical long-term average,\" which is precise and natural.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently, as it is the standard abbreviation.\n- Use \"stress-testing\" as a lowercase term, as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"mortgage interest rates\" consistently.\n- Use \"property mortgage lending\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"their historical long-term average\" for grammatical accuracy and clarity.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA reduced the assumed increase in mortgage interest rates for stress-testing of property mortgage lending from 300 basis points to 200 basis points in September. The HKMA made this decision after taking into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend of mortgage interest rates compared to their historical long-term average. The HKMA believes this level is sufficient to ensure that risks in banks' mortgage businesses are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and Debt Servicing Ratio of Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nOver the past year, the HKMA has introduced several measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include the issuance in May of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the Supervisory Policy Manual, outlining the governance and control frameworks that the HKMA expects authorized institutions to maintain to ensure operational resilience, as well as organizing two industry dialogues to enhance the industry's understanding of the new standards and promote experience sharing within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing detailed supervisory guidance on various aspects of banking operations, including specific areas such as customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and anti-DDoS protection. The translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"supervisory guidance,\" \"customer data protection,\" \"payment system operations,\" and \"anti-distributed denial of service (anti-DDoS) protection\" are all translated accurately.\n- The overall structure and meaning of the sentence are preserved in all translations.\n- The use of \"banking operations\" or \"bank operations\" is appropriate, though \"banking operations\" is slightly more formal and precise.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- The use of \"has also provided\" (as in translations 4 and 6) introduces a past tense that may not align with the original text's neutral tone, which appears to describe an ongoing or general action.\n- The phrase \"among others\" (in translations 2 and 6) adds an element not explicitly present in the original text, which may be unnecessary unless the original implies that the list is not exhaustive.\n- The choice between \"bank operations\" and \"banking operations\" is stylistic, but \"banking operations\" is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency, employ \"banking operations\" for formality, and maintain the present tense to reflect the general nature of the guidance provided.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe HKMA also provides detailed supervisory guidance on specific aspects of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and anti-distributed denial of service (anti-DDoS) protection.\n\nIn response to the ever-changing cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is striving to enhance the cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector by promoting banks to adopt a robust tertiary data backup arrangement, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the clearly increased risk of \"phishing\" scams and other online fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign themed \"Digital KEY, Be Careful! Think Twice Before Clicking Links!\" in September to raise public awareness. In addition, they co-organized a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force in July to brief banks on the latest fraud techniques used by criminals.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign with the theme \"Watch the digital KEY closely—think twice before clicking the LINK!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogues \"Embarking on a Journey of Operational Resilience\"\n\n# Liquidity Positions and Market Risk\n\nFacing increased market volatility caused by further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the HKMA has strengthened its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk commitments. The HKMA is conducting reviews to assess whether authorized institutions have adequate liquidity risk management, with a focus on the systems and control measures for diversifying funding sources and intragroup liquidity risk management. In addition, the HKMA is also conducting reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the market risk management frameworks and treasury activities controls of authorized institutions.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

International Financial Center\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar and largely correct. The main differences lie in capitalization and punctuation. The first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" and place it after \"Hong Kong's,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common in modern English usage. The second, third, and sixth translations use \"status\" with a lowercase \"s,\" which is also correct and perhaps more natural in contemporary writing.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are acceptable. However, the most natural and commonly used form in English would be \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial center,\" which is used in the second, third, and sixth translations. This form is more consistent with standard English usage in formal and academic contexts.\nGiven the similarity of the translations and the lack of a specific dictionary to guide term selection, the best possible translation would be the one that is most natural and commonly used in English, which is \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\" This version is grammatically correct, fluent, and appropriate for the context.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, highlighting the HKMA's efforts in 2022 to enhance Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive financial center. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, structure, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's position\/status as a globally competitive international financial center\" is consistently used, which is accurate and natural.\n- The use of \"multi-pronged approach\" is appropriate and conveys the idea of \"多管齊下\" effectively.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation is slightly less fluent due to the structure \"took multiple measures in 2022, making significant progress...\" which feels a bit abrupt.\n- The second translation is concise but lacks the nuance of \"多管齊下\" (multi-pronged approach).\n- The third translation is well-structured and includes \"multi-pronged approach,\" but uses \"financial centre\" (British spelling), which is less common in American English.\n- The fourth translation is fluent and includes all key elements, but uses \"implemented a multi-pronged approach\" which is slightly more formal than necessary.\n- The fifth translation uses \"internationally competitive financial center\" instead of \"globally competitive international financial center,\" which is a minor deviation from the original.\n- The sixth translation is very close to the best version, using \"adopted a multi-pronged approach\" and \"globally competitive international financial center.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency.\n- Include \"multi-pronged approach\" to reflect \"多管齊下.\"\n- Use \"financial center\" (American spelling) for consistency with common usage in English financial contexts.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally and maintains the original emphasis on the year (2022) and the agency's efforts.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nIn 2022, the HKMA adopted a multi-pronged approach and made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial center.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the event being described as successfully held and its impact on Hong Kong's status and the ripple effect being clearly stated.\n- The use of terms like \"reinforce,\" \"consolidate,\" and \"generate\" are all appropriate and convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"consolidates\" which is slightly less common in this context compared to \"reinforce\" or \"strengthen.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses quotation marks around the summit's name, which is unnecessary unless the name is being emphasized or introduced for the first time.\n- **Translation 3** and **5** are very similar, but **5** includes \"to participate,\" which is redundant since the verb \"attracting\" already implies participation.\n- **Translation 4** also includes \"to participate,\" which is unnecessary and slightly disrupts the flow.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"more than 120\" instead of \"approximately 120,\" which is a minor but notable deviation from the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- The phrase \"not only... but also\" is used effectively in all translations, but the placement of the clauses can be refined for better flow.\n- The verb \"reinforce\" is more natural in this context than \"consolidate\" or \"generate\" for the ripple effect.\n- The phrase \"creating a positive ripple effect\" is slightly more idiomatic than \"generating a positive ripple effect.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. This not only reinforced Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center but also created a positive ripple effect.\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. This not only reinforced Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center but also created a positive ripple effect.\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. This not only reinforced Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center but also created a positive ripple effect.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations accurately reflect the core content of the original text and correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable. However, differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and stylistic choices affect the overall quality.\nThe first translation is fluent and well-structured, with appropriate use of terms like \"Dual Counter Market Making regime\" and \"Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\" However, it uses \"PBOC\" instead of \"People’s Bank of China,\" which is not in the dictionary, and \"liquidity positions\" is used inconsistently.\nThe second translation is also strong, with accurate terminology and a clear structure. It uses \"liquidity positions\" consistently and correctly refers to \"CMU\" without expanding it. However, it uses \"Asia-Pacific region\" instead of \"Asia,\" which is not in the dictionary.\nThe third translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"PBOC\" instead of the full name, which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"leading international central securities depository in the Asia-Pacific region,\" which is not in the dictionary.\nThe fourth translation is concise and accurate, using \"People's Bank of China\" and \"liquidity\" consistently. It avoids unnecessary abbreviations and maintains a clear flow.\nThe fifth translation is very similar to the fourth, with a slightly different opening and a more formal tone. It uses \"mainland markets\" instead of \"mainland market,\" which is not in the dictionary.\nThe sixth translation uses \"FMIs\" and \"CMU\" correctly but introduces \"Asia’s leading international central securities depository,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"Renminbi liquidity positions\" instead of \"renminbi liquidity.\"\nThe best translation would combine the strengths of these versions, using full names where appropriate, maintaining consistency in terminology, and ensuring that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified. It should avoid unnecessary abbreviations and maintain a natural, fluent tone.\nFinal Translation:\nSignificant progress has been made in consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore renminbi business hub, including optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People’s Bank of China, as well as the HKMA's Renminbi Liquidity Facility, to ensure sufficient renminbi liquidity and support further development of renminbi-denominated products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of \"Swap Connect\" with the People’s Bank of China and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC); collaborating with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to introduce the Dual Counter Market Making regime, promoting the trading of renminbi-denominated stocks in Hong Kong; and the HKMA launching a multi-year plan to further optimize financial market infrastructures and develop the Central Moneymarkets Unit into a major international central securities depository in Asia. Benefiting from ample renminbi liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and the various Mainland-Hong Kong Connect schemes, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for mainland capital entering international markets and for international investors investing in the rapidly growing mainland market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, with the exception of the sixth translation, which capitalizes \"Green and Sustainable Finance\" inconsistently. The dictionary allows for either case, but consistency is preferred.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some phrases are slightly awkward. For example, \"raising awareness of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it brings\" (Translation 1) is slightly less natural than \"helping them understand Hong Kong's sound financial system and the prospects it offers\" (Translation 4).\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The use of \"sound\" (Translation 4 and 5) is more natural than \"robust\" or \"stable\" in the context of a financial system. \"Prospects\" is more precise than \"opportunities\" in the context of the financial system's future.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they accurately reflect the role of the HKMA and the financial services sector in Hong Kong.\n5. **Consistency**: Translation 5 and 6 use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" at the beginning, which is more formal and appropriate for an official context. However, the use of \"everyone\" in Translation 3 (\"so that everyone can recognize...\") is less precise than \"them\" in other translations.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts towards overseas and mainland stakeholders, helping them understand Hong Kong's sound financial system and the prospects it offers.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting the broader adoption of financial technology across the financial sector to further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System (FPS), known as \"轉數快,\" continues to grow steadily, with the number of registered users exceeding 10 million in March, and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all largely accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, style, and adherence to the dictionary terms that can be refined for optimal clarity and professionalism.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"central banking and regulatory forums\" for \"央行及監管組織.\"\n- All translations use either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局,\" which is appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development\" is accurate and natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"HKMA\" without the article \"The,\" which is acceptable in formal writing but may be less common in some contexts.\n- The second translation uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is fully correct but slightly more verbose than \"HKMA.\"\n- The third translation omits \"The\" before \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n- The fourth translation uses \"The HKMA,\" which is correct and concise.\n- The fifth translation reorders the phrase \"both internationally and within the region,\" which is slightly more verbose but still correct.\n- The sixth translation uses \"the global efforts to maintain...\" which is slightly more natural than \"in maintaining.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the preferred term for brevity and consistency with financial institution naming conventions.\n- Include the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" for grammatical correctness and formality.\n- Use \"to maintain\" instead of \"in maintaining\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally and professionally.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"金管局\" is translated as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" \"國際金融領袖投資峰會\" as \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit,\" \"金融業\" as \"financial sector,\" and \"財政司司長\" as \"Financial Secretary.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are well-structured and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are slight variations in tone and word choice that could be refined for greater precision and naturalness. For instance, \"implementing the plan\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, and 5) is slightly more passive than \"to implement the plan\" (used in translations 4 and 6), which may better reflect the active role of the HKMA in organizing the summit. Similarly, \"heavyweight guests\" (translations 4 and 5) and \"high-profile guests\" (translations 1, 3, and 6) are both acceptable, but \"distinguished guests\" (translation 2) may be more formal and appropriate in this context.\nThe phrase \"fully demonstrating the global financial community's support for Hong Kong\" is used in all translations, which is accurate. However, \"fully demonstrating\" could be slightly more natural as \"clearly demonstrating\" or \"fully reflecting.\"\nThe use of \"financial centre\" (translation 5) versus \"financial center\" (others) is a matter of British vs. American English spelling, but since the original text uses Traditional Chinese, which is more aligned with British English conventions, \"financial centre\" may be more appropriate.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining word choice for greater fluency and naturalness.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, the HKMA hosted the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit to implement the plans announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial sector, who shared their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amidst various uncertainties. The event received a strong response, attracting over 200 distinguished guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, clearly demonstrating the global financial community's support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further consolidated its position as an offshore renminbi hub, with offshore renminbi business showing steady growth this year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between mainland China and international financial markets. The mutual market access schemes between Hong Kong and mainland China are widely recognized as the preferred channels for international investors to access onshore capital markets and for mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, the trading volume of the Northbound Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the total trading volume of overseas investors in the China Interbank Bond Market. Since their launch in 2021, the Southbound Bond Connect and Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect have operated smoothly. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of Swap Connect, further expanding financial cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China into the derivatives market, and reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a major offshore renminbi business hub and risk management centre. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBoC was optimized in July, marking another important milestone in strengthening Hong Kong's role as an offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nTo provide a more diversified range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in the Hong Kong stock market. The working group has commenced preparatory work, including the introduction of the Dual Counter Market Making regime, to optimize the trading mechanism for Hong Kong dollar and RMB dual-counter stocks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"金融業\" as \"financial sector,\" \"區內綠色和可 sustainable金融樞紐\" as \"regional green and sustainable finance hub,\" \"稅務及監管環境\" as \"tax and regulatory environment,\" and \"金管局\" as either \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" \nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and fluent English structure.\n- Proper use of formal tone appropriate for official statements.\n- Correct use of prepositions and articles.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"financial platform\" while others use \"financial sector.\" The original text uses \"金融平台,\" which more accurately translates to \"financial platform.\" However, \"financial sector\" is also a common and acceptable term in this context, and the difference is minor.\n- The phrase \"create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment\" appears in several translations. While grammatically correct, \"favorable\" may be a more natural and commonly used term in formal English.\n- Some translations use \"introduce\" while others use \"promote\" or \"strengthen market promotion.\" \"Introduce\" is slightly less precise than \"promote\" or \"market promotion\" in this context.\n- The use of \"Mainland\" versus \"mainland\" is inconsistent. \"Mainland\" should be lowercase unless it is the beginning of a sentence.\n- Some translations use \"is working closely\" while others use \"closely collaborates with.\" Both are correct, but \"collaborates closely\" is slightly more formal and direct.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"financial platform\" to match the original term, \"favorable\" instead of \"convenient,\" and \"market promotion\" as the most precise term for the intended meaning. It would also maintain consistency in the use of \"mainland\" with lowercase and ensure that the tone remains formal and professional.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management center, the HKMA collaborates closely with the government and the financial sector to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA is strengthening market promotion, introducing Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders overseas and on the mainland.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Fintech 2025,\" \"HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO),\" \"e-HKD,\" \"Commercial Data Interchange (CDI),\" and \"Faster Payment System (FPS).\"\n- The structure of the bullet points is consistent across translations, and the overall message is clear.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and regulatory terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"fintech\" while others use \"financial technology,\" which should be standardized. The dictionary lists both, but \"fintech\" is more commonly used in modern contexts.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations use phrases like \"to be rolled out this year\" or \"implemented this year,\" which can be simplified to \"launched this year\" or \"introduced this year.\"\n- **Minor grammatical issues:** For example, \"enhancing Hong Kong's position as an fintech hub\" should be \"as a fintech hub.\"\n- **Inconsistent use of quotation marks and italics:** Some translations use quotation marks around \"Fintech 2025\" while others do not, and \"TransferFast\" is incorrectly used in one translation instead of \"FPS.\"\n- **Ambiguity in \"resource policies\":** The phrase \"leveraging resource policies\" is not standard. The dictionary does not list this term, so it should be translated as \"leveraging policy support\" or \"leveraging resources.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"fintech\" consistently as it is more concise and commonly used.\n- Use \"launched this year\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, including \"e-HKD\" and \"FPS.\"\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure grammatical correctness.\n- Maintain a professional and fluent tone throughout the translation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) continues to collaborate with various banking sectors to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub. Key initiatives launched this year include:\n- Promoting the application of regulatory technology (RegTech) and conducting fintech application assessments;\n- Advancing work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail central bank digital currency (i.e., \"e-HKD\") in Hong Kong;\n- Launching \"Commercial Data Interchange\" (CDI);\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging policy support to strengthen the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting broader use of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"FMI,\" \"RTGS systems,\" \"CMU,\" \"Northbound Bond Connect,\" and \"EFBNs.\"\n- Most translations maintain the key numerical data and percentages accurately.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, preserving the logical flow of the information.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"financial market infrastructure (FMI)\" instead of \"financial infrastructure,\" which is less precise than the dictionary term \"FMI\" without the \"market\" qualifier.\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly states \"12,075 billion HKD\" instead of \"1,207.5 billion HKD\" for the EFBNs, which is a significant numerical error.\n- **Translation 3** contains a typo: \"100%2 system availability\" and uses \"financial centre\" instead of \"financial center.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"financial infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI\" and refers to \"Bond Connect's 'Northbound' and 'Southbound' channels\" instead of \"Northbound Bond Connect\" and \"Southbound Bond Connect.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"unpaid\" instead of \"outstanding\" and incorrectly states \"12,075 billion HKD\" instead of \"1,207.5 billion HKD.\"\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate, using \"FMI\" correctly, \"outstanding\" instead of \"unpaid,\" and the correct numerical values. However, it could be slightly more fluent.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"FMI\" is used without unnecessary qualifiers.\n- Use \"outstanding\" consistently for financial instruments.\n- Correct numerical formatting (e.g., \"1,207.5 billion HKD\" instead of \"12,075 billion HKD\").\n- Maintain the exact terminology from the dictionary, such as \"Northbound Bond Connect\" and \"Southbound Bond Connect.\"\n- Ensure that the term \"system availability\" is used consistently and accurately.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of the most accurate translations while correcting the identified weaknesses.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe reliable and efficient operation of FMI is key to consolidating Hong Kong's position as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for the Northbound Bond Connect and Southbound Bond Connect remained smooth. At year-end, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) held in the CMU system was HKD 1,207.5 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HKD 1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS\" and \"SVF e-wallets\" where required.\n- The numerical data (11.48 million, 40% increase) is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the Faster Payment System\" redundantly and includes \"the\" unnecessarily in \"the continued rise in using the Faster Payment System.\"\n- **Translation 2** is the most concise and grammatically precise, using \"FPS\" consistently and avoiding redundancy.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"grew steadily\" and \"the average daily transaction volume\" which is slightly less precise than \"daily average transaction volume.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"registrations\" instead of \"registered users,\" which is less precise in this context.\n- **Translation 5** uses quotation marks around \"Faster Payment System\" unnecessarily and includes \"settle payments to merchants,\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"pay merchants\" instead of \"make payments to merchants,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"FPS\" consistently where appropriate, as it is a commonly used acronym in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"daily average transaction volume\" is more natural and precise than \"average daily transaction volume.\"\n- The phrase \"make payments to merchants\" is more formal and appropriate in a financial context than \"pay merchants.\"\n- The use of \"registrations\" should be replaced with \"registered users\" for clarity.\n- Redundant use of \"the\" before \"Faster Payment System\" should be avoided for fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe usage of FPS continued to grow in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with the daily average transaction volume increasing by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the continued increase in using FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up SVF e-wallets or bank accounts has been the main driver behind the significant growth in FPS transaction volume.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (SVFs) (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA continued to assist the government in the smooth implementation of the Consumption Voucher Scheme by coordinating and facilitating communication and cooperation between relevant government agencies and the SVF licensees appointed under the scheme.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (full name) and \"HKMA\" appropriately. The use of \"summarizing the feedback received on the discussion paper\" is natural. However, \"summarizing the feedback received on the discussion paper and the HKMA’s responses\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. The phrase \"summarizing the opinions collected from the discussion paper\" is slightly less natural than \"summarizing the feedback received on the discussion paper.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second, with the exception of \"consolidating the views collected from the discussion paper,\" which is slightly more formal and less commonly used than \"summarizing the feedback received.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is concise and grammatically correct. However, it omits the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses only \"HKMA,\" which may be less formal. The phrase \"summarizing the opinions collected on the discussion paper\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and includes the full name of the authority in parentheses. However, the phrase \"summarized the opinions collected on its discussion paper, released in January 2023\" is slightly awkward in structure and may confuse the reader about the timeline.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is the most polished. It uses \"published\" instead of \"released\" or \"summarized,\" which is more formal and appropriate for official documents. The phrase \"adopt a risk-based and flexible approach to regulating stablecoins\" is more natural than \"regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner.\" The use of \"elaborates on the expected scope of regulation\" is also more precise than \"outlines the expected regulatory scope.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use of \"published\" instead of \"released\" or \"summarized\" is more formal and appropriate for official documents.\n- \"Adopt a risk-based and flexible approach to regulating stablecoins\" is more natural and precise.\n- \"Elaborates on the expected scope of regulation\" is more precise than \"outlines the expected regulatory scope.\"\n- Including the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in parentheses with the acronym \"HKMA\" is more formal and appropriate for official contexts.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published a summary of the discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins in January 2023, outlining the feedback received on the discussion paper and the HKMA’s responses. The summary document confirms that the HKMA will adopt a risk-based and flexible approach to regulating stablecoins, and elaborates on the expected scope of regulation, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking matters, taking on leadership roles in various regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has served as chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) for three consecutive terms. In addition, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as well as the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Furthermore, the HKMA leads the subgroup under the FSB responsible for monitoring progress and follow-up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nThe original sentence is straightforward: 「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行. The key term, 「國際金融領袖投資峰會」, must be translated as \"Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" as per the dictionary. The rest of the sentence provides a date range and the verb \"舉行\" (held\/take place).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The 'Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit' was held from November 1st to 3rd.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of the term from the dictionary, proper tense (\"was held\"), and clear date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of quotation marks around the event name is unnecessary and slightly informal.  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was held from November 1st to 3rd.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct term, proper tense, and clear date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, concise translation.  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit will be held from November 1st to 3rd.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct term and date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrect tense (\"will be held\")—the event has already occurred, so past tense is appropriate.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit took place from November 1 to 3.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct term and use of \"took place\" as an alternative to \"was held.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The date format is inconsistent (no \"st\" on the days), which may be considered less formal or less precise.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was held from November 1st to 3rd.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct term, tense, and date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong translation.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was held from November 1st to 3rd.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the fifth translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is also a strong translation.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, use the appropriate tense, and maintain a formal tone suitable for reporting on an event. The second, fifth, and sixth translations are all correct, but the second one is the most concise and avoids any unnecessary punctuation (such as quotation marks). The date format \"November 1st to 3rd\" is standard and clear. The verb \"was held\" is appropriate for a past event.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the 2022–23 Budget, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) held the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in November. The three-day summit received a warm response, bringing together 26 distinguished leaders from the financial sector to share unique insights and ideas on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instabilities, as well as how to seize the opportunities arising from these challenges. The summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their Group Chairmen or Chief Executives. Participating institutions included many of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe original text conveys a message about the resumption of normalcy in Hong Kong and the opportunities it presents to global financial leaders. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and structure.\nTranslation 1 uses \"fully recovered\" and \"developing business in Asia,\" which are natural but slightly less precise than \"returned to normal.\" It also uses \"global community,\" which is slightly broader than \"world\" but still acceptable.\nTranslation 2 uses \"fully returned to normal\" and \"dynamism,\" which is a good synonym for \"vitality.\" It also uses \"in the process of developing business in Asia,\" which is slightly more wordy than necessary.\nTranslation 3 uses \"returned to normal\" and \"dynamism,\" which is a good choice. It also uses \"developing Asian businesses,\" which is slightly more specific than \"developing business in Asia.\"\nTranslation 4 uses \"returned to normal\" and \"developing their Asian business,\" which is slightly more personal than the original text suggests.\nTranslation 5 uses \"returned to normalcy,\" which is a slightly more formal and precise term than \"returned to normal.\" It also uses \"developing Asian business,\" which is concise and accurate.\nTranslation 6 uses \"returned to normal\" and \"developing Asian business,\" which is concise and accurate. It also uses \"allowing global financial leaders to personally experience,\" which is slightly more passive than the original text.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would use \"returned to normal\" as it is the most direct and accurate translation of \"一切復常.\" It would also use \"developing Asian business\" as it is concise and accurate. The verb \"can personally experience\" is more active and direct than \"allowing global financial leaders to personally experience.\"\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be:\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world that Hong Kong has returned to normal; global financial leaders can personally experience Hong Kong's unique resilience and vitality and understand the opportunities Hong Kong can offer in developing Asian business.\n\n# Hong Kong as the main gateway to the mainland and a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub, including enhancing liquidity positions, further strengthening connectivity with mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructures. Renminbi business, including deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance, continued to record steady growth during the year. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding mutual market access schemes. The Bank for International Settlements’ triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover in 2022 once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as a renminbi foreign exchange centre.\n\nNorthbound Bond Connect continues to be the primary channel for international investors to access the mainland bond market through Hong Kong’s market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily turnover of Northbound Bond Connect reached RMB 32.2 billion (a 25% increase from 2021), accounting for 61% of the overall turnover of overseas investors in the China Interbank Bond Market.\n\nNorthbound Bond Connect introduced technical optimization measures in July, including the digitization of the process for investors to participate in the primary market issuance of domestic bonds and the reduction of service fees. These market-oriented optimization measures have enhanced the operational efficiency of Northbound Bond Connect and reduced investors' transaction costs.\n\nTo improve the translation of the original text, it is essential to evaluate the junior translators' work critically. All translations are generally accurate and fluent, with minor variations in phrasing and terminology. However, some translations use slightly less precise terms or include unnecessary redundancy. For instance, \"cross-boundary\" in the second translation is not standard English in this context, and \"mutual access cooperation\" in the third translation is less precise than \"cross-border connectivity cooperation.\" Additionally, some translations use \"mainland China\" repeatedly, which, while not incorrect, may be unnecessarily verbose compared to \"the mainland.\"\nThe term \"risk management centre\" is consistently translated correctly as \"risk management centre\" in all translations, and \"Swap Connect\" is also consistently used. The term \"Northbound Trading\" is also correctly used in all translations. However, the term \"interest rate swap markets\" is translated as \"interest rate swap markets\" in all translations, which is accurate.\nThe phrase \"the preparation work for 'Swap Connect' is proceeding in an orderly manner\" is well phrased in most translations, though \"proceeding in an orderly manner\" could be more naturally phrased as \"proceeding in an orderly fashion\" or \"proceeding smoothly.\"\nThe term \"HKMA\" is used correctly in all translations, though \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is also acceptable and may be preferred in more formal contexts.\nThe phrase \"to further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market\" is repeated in several translations and is accurate, though \"participation in\" in the fourth translation is slightly more natural.\nIn terms of vocabulary and fluency, all translations are very close to each other, with only minor differences in phrasing. The most natural and fluent translation would likely combine the best elements of each, using precise terminology and natural phrasing.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"cross-border connectivity cooperation\" for \"互聯互通合作,\" \"Northbound Trading\" for \"北向交易,\" \"Swap Connect\" for \"互換通,\" and \"risk management centre\" for \"風險管理中心.\" It would also use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"interest rate swap markets\" for \"利率互換市場.\" The translation should be concise, natural, and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\nHere is the improved translation:\nTo enhance the supporting measures for the Northbound Bond Connect and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in mainland bonds, Hong Kong and the mainland announced in July the launch of a cross-border connectivity cooperation between the two interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will open Northbound Trading, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through the connection between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management centre. The preparation work for Swap Connect is proceeding in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound Trading as soon as possible. The HKMA will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore more diversified risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore government bond futures, to further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market.\n\nSince the launch of the Southbound Bond Connect in 2021, the market response has been positive, with smooth operations and transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and priced in various currencies. The Southbound Bond Connect has promoted the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly with a significant increase in the issuance of RMB-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with relevant mainland authorities to study ways to optimize the Southbound Bond Connect and promote the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1

translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. For example, the first and second translations use smoother sentence structures and more natural phrasing. The third translation uses \"turbulent\" instead of \"volatile,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise in this context. The fourth translation is concise but lacks some of the nuance in the original. The fifth and sixth translations are very similar and both maintain a high level of fluency.\n2. **Vocabulary and Nuance**: The use of \"shattered\" in translations 2 and 3 is more impactful than \"challenged\" or \"broke.\" The term \"marked the only year\" is more precise than \"became the only instance\" or \"marked the first time.\" The phrase \"negative Return\" in translation 3 is inconsistent with the dictionary entry, which specifies \"Return\" as a capitalized term. The use of \"Performance of the Exchange Fund\" in translations 3 and 4 is correct but should be used consistently.\n3. **Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, with the exception of translation 3, which uses \"Return\" as a lowercase word, and translation 4, which uses \"Performance of the Exchange Fund\" inconsistently. The term \"non-dollar currencies\" in translation 5 is slightly less precise than \"non-US dollar currencies\" as per the dictionary.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only shattered the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, but also marked the only year in nearly half a century where stocks, bonds, and major non-US dollar currencies all recorded negative Returns. In such a challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses suffered by most multi-asset funds during the year, the Performance of the Exchange Fund reflects the HKMA's diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as defensive measures and strategic adjustments made in response to changes in the external environment, effectively reducing the impact of market storms.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the delegated authority and terms of delegation from the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in style, fluency, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Base,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"US dollar-denominated assets,\" and \"Return.\"\n- The structure of the list (i) to (iv) is preserved in all translations, maintaining the original's formal tone.\n- Most translations use appropriate verbs like \"ensure,\" \"safeguard,\" and \"maintain\" to reflect the original's intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in verb usage:** Some translations use \"preserve\" (e.g., \"ensure capital preservation\"), while others use \"safeguard\" or \"protect.\" While all are acceptable, \"safeguard\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations, such as \"seek investment Return as far as possible, consistent with the above (i) to (iii),\" are slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n- **Tense and voice:** Some translations use the infinitive form (e.g., \"to preserve capital\") while others use the base verb (e.g., \"safeguard capital\"). The original uses a declarative tone, so the base verb form is more appropriate.\n- **Clarity of \"seek investment Return\":** The phrase \"seek investment Return\" is slightly awkward and could be improved to \"seek to maximize investment returns\" or \"strive to achieve investment returns.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"safeguard\" consistently for \"保障\" to maintain a formal and precise tone.\n- Use the base verb form (e.g., \"safeguard capital\") rather than the infinitive or noun form for consistency with the original's declarative tone.\n- Simplify and clarify the phrasing in (iv) to avoid redundancy and improve fluency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) Safeguard capital;\n(ii) Ensure that the overall Monetary Base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) Ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Seek to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a legal or financial context. The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"portfolio structure\" and \"target asset mix\" for \"組合架構\" and \"目標資產配置,\" respectively.\n- The term \"Exchange Fund\" is consistently used, which is appropriate given the context.\n- The use of \"statutory purposes\" or \"statutory objectives\" is accurate for \"法定目的.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"objectives\" for \"目標,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"targets\" or \"goals\" in this context.\n- The fifth and sixth translators use \"targets\" and \"target\" respectively, which may be more precise than \"objectives\" in a financial context.\n- The sixth translation uses \"has been reflected\" instead of \"have been reflected,\" which is grammatically incorrect due to subject-verb agreement.\n- The first and third translations use \"comprehensively\" and \"fully\" respectively, which are both acceptable but \"fully\" is more concise and commonly used in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Targets\" may be more appropriate than \"objectives\" in a financial or investment context, as it aligns with \"目標資產配置\" (target asset mix).\n- \"Fully\" is more concise and natural in formal writing than \"comprehensively.\"\n- Subject-verb agreement must be maintained: \"have been reflected\" is correct when referring to plural subjects like \"objectives.\"\n- The phrase \"as stipulated by law\" is slightly more verbose than necessary; \"statutory\" is sufficient and more concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above targets fully take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset mix of the Exchange Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Exchange Fund Portfolio Segregation\nThe original title, \"圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別,\" translates to \"Figure 1 Exchange Fund Portfolio Segregation.\" The dictionary provides two options for \"外匯基金\" — \"EF\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" While \"EF\" is an abbreviation, \"Exchange Fund\" is the full and more appropriate term for formal documentation. \"投資組合類別\" is translated as \"Portfolio segregation,\" which is accurate in the context of financial terminology.\nAmong the junior translators' versions, several are grammatically correct and fluent. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation. For instance, the use of an apostrophe in \"Exchange Fund's Portfolio segregation\" is unnecessary and slightly informal. Additionally, \"Portfolio segregation\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun in this context, referring to a specific classification or category.\nThe best version would be one that uses the full name \"Exchange Fund,\" capitalizes \"Portfolio Segregation\" as a proper noun, and avoids unnecessary punctuation. Therefore, \"Figure 1 Exchange Fund Portfolio Segregation\" is the most appropriate and professional translation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Backing Portfolio,\" \"Investment Portfolio,\" \"US dollar-denominated assets,\" \"Monetary Base,\" \"Currency Board arrangements,\" \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,\" and \"member economies.\" This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are slight variations in phrasing that affect the naturalness and precision of the English. For instance, \"provide full support for the Monetary Base\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, and 5) is slightly more formal and precise than \"provide full support to the Monetary Base\" (used in translation 6), which is still correct but slightly less idiomatic in this context.\nThe use of \"bond and equity markets\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5) is more precise than \"bond and stock markets\" (translations 4 and 6), as \"equity markets\" is the more commonly used term in financial contexts. Additionally, \"safeguard the value\" (translations 1, 3, 5) and \"preserve the value\" (translation 3) are both acceptable, but \"safeguard\" is slightly more aligned with the original intent of protecting the value of assets.\nThe phrase \"in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5) is more precise than \"as stipulated by\" (translation 2) or \"in accordance with\" (translation 6), though all are acceptable.\nConsidering these nuances, the best possible translation would combine the most natural and precise phrasing from the available options, ensuring clarity, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nThe final translation would be:\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full support for the Monetary Base in accordance with Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging market bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset mix of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, along with the allocation of other asset classes, is formulated in accordance with prudent risk management principles and the portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"has held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes\" is slightly awkward. The phrase \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account\" is not idiomatic in English.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"consistently held\" and \"performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investment returns,\" which are natural expressions. However, it omits the mention of the government, which is present in the original text.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation includes the government, which is correct, but it uses \"EF\" instead of \"Exchange Fund\" as required by the dictionary. It also uses \"has not been included\" instead of \"does not include,\" which is slightly less direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"purchased for the Exchange Fund account by the Government for strategic purposes,\" which is a natural and precise rendering. However, it uses \"the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it,\" which is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"under the Exchange Fund account\" and \"its performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance,\" which are natural and precise. However, it uses \"the government\" instead of \"the Government\" (capitalized), which is a minor issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes\" and \"its investment performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investments.\" However, it omits the mention of the government, which is present in the original text.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The original text mentions that the shares were purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account.\n- The dictionary specifies that \"外匯基金\" should be translated as either \"EF\" or \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"策略性資產組合\" as \"Strategic Portfolio.\"\n- The most natural and accurate translation should include the government, use \"Exchange Fund\" (not \"EF\"), and maintain a fluent and grammatically correct structure.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investments.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct. It uses \"major individual example\" which is slightly awkward, but otherwise it is a solid translation.\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being \"main individual example\" instead of \"major individual example.\" The choice of \"main\" is slightly more natural in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"from time to time\" instead of \"occasionally,\" which is a stylistic choice but still correct. It also uses \"Return\" with a capital \"R,\" which is not standard unless referring to a specific term. The phrase \"allocation between\" is slightly less precise than \"proportion in.\"\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"primary individual example,\" which is a bit more formal than \"main\" or \"major.\" It also uses \"Return\" with a capital \"R,\" which is not standard in this context.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"major exception\" instead of \"major individual example,\" which is a more natural phrasing in this context. It also uses \"weight\" instead of \"proportion,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise.\n6. **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 5, but it uses \"primary exception\" instead of \"major exception.\" It also uses \"within\" instead of \"in,\" which is slightly more precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\n- \"Occasionally\" is more natural than \"from time to time\" or \"from time to time.\"\n- \"Main individual example\" is more natural than \"major\" or \"primary.\"\n- \"Return\" should not be capitalized unless it refers to a specific term.\n- \"Proportion in\" is more precise than \"allocation between\" or \"weight within.\"\n- \"Major exception\" is more natural than \"primary exception.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use \"occasionally,\" \"main individual example,\" \"return\" in lowercase, and \"proportion in.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from Fiscal Reserves, Government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, but the Future Fund is a main individual example. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the return of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio mix. The proportion of the Future Fund in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was approximately 35:65 in 2022.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and clarity. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"EFAC,\" \"investment benchmark,\" \"tactical asset allocation,\" \"tactical deviations,\" \"EF,\" \"tracking error,\" \"HKMA,\" \"position,\" \"Return,\" \"asset allocation,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" \"portfolio managers,\" \"strategic asset allocation,\" and \"investment process.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in word choice and sentence structure.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** Some translations use \"strategic asset allocation\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" interchangeably, but the original text clearly distinguishes between them. For example, in Translation 3, the phrase \"the HKMA is authorized to decide on strategic asset allocation\" is incorrect, as the HKMA is authorized to determine \"tactical asset allocation.\"\n- **Phrasing and Nuance:** Some translations use \"strive for returns exceeding the benchmark\" (Translation 4) or \"seek to achieve Return exceeding the benchmark\" (Translation 1), which are slightly awkward or inconsistent in capitalization.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations\" (Translation 1) versus \"the gap between actual and benchmark allocation\" (Translation 4), which are semantically similar but not identical in phrasing.\n- **Capitalization of \"Return\":** In Translation 1, \"Return\" is capitalized, which may be incorrect unless it refers to a specific term or metric.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Ensure that \"strategic asset allocation\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" are used consistently and correctly, as per the original text.\n- Use consistent phrasing for \"difference between actual and benchmark allocations\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure that \"Return\" is not unnecessarily capitalized unless it refers to a specific term.\n- Use \"tracking error limits\" consistently, as in the dictionary.\n- Ensure that the HKMA is authorized to determine \"tactical asset allocation,\" not \"strategic asset allocation.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through the investment benchmark, which represents the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, and through tactical asset allocation, it aims to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The HKMA is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Investment Office,\" \"risk management functions,\" \"global fixed-income markets,\" \"EF,\" \"Investment Portfolio (IP),\" \"derivative overlay portfolios,\" \"macro risk management strategies,\" and \"Backing Portfolio (BP).\" However, some translations use \"EF\" inconsistently or not at all, which could be improved for clarity and consistency.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some suffer from awkward phrasing or redundancy. For example, \"The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments\" is more natural than \"The staff of the office is directly responsible for managing approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments.\"\n3. **Clarity and Precision**: Some translations use \"the internally managed Investment Portfolio\" when the original text refers to \"the internally managed investment portfolio,\" which is more precise. Also, the phrase \"execute the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies\" is more natural than \"implement\" or \"carry out.\"\n4. **Consistency in Terminology**: Some translations use \"EF\" while others use \"Exchange Fund,\" which is acceptable, but using \"EF\" consistently where appropriate would enhance clarity, especially in financial contexts.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate for a financial document, using formal and precise language suitable for the context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund (EF). The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the EF's investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio (BP) and part of the Investment Portfolio (IP). This internally managed portion of the Investment Portfolio includes diverse investments in global fixed-income markets and implements the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivative overlay portfolios.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to manage approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of employing external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialised investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of terminology consistency, grammatical precision, and stylistic nuance. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" and \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary. However, some translations use \"Investment Portfolio\" (e.g., Translation 1 and 4), while others use \"investment portfolios\" (e.g., Translation 2, 3, 5, 6). The dictionary lists both \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"IP\" as acceptable, but \"investment portfolios\" is more natural in plural contexts. \"Liquidity positions\" is used in some translations (1, 4, 5), which is correct per the dictionary, but \"liquidity\" alone is more commonly used in financial contexts unless referring to specific positions.\n2. **Grammar and Syntax**: Most translations are grammatically sound. However, Translation 1 uses \"has established... and has established\" which is repetitive. Translation 4 has a minor grammatical error: \"compliance system\" should be \"compliance systems\" to match the plural \"risk monitoring.\"\n3. **Fluency and Style**: Translations 2, 3, and 6 are the most fluent and natural in tone. Translation 2 uses \"making the importance of risk management self-evident,\" which is slightly more idiomatic than \"the importance... is self-evident.\" Translation 3 uses \"implemented a three-line defense system\" which is more active than \"has established.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate for a formal, professional context. However, \"three-line defense system\" is a standard term in risk management, so it is appropriate to use it as is.\n**Reasoning for Improvement**: The best translation should maintain consistency in terminology, use natural English phrasing, and avoid redundancy. It should use \"investment portfolios\" in plural contexts, \"liquidity\" rather than \"liquidity positions\" unless specifically required, and ensure that all dictionary terms are translated accurately. It should also use active voice where appropriate and maintain a professional tone.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, and has set up rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA has implemented a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), and the establishment of risk management procedures provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor variations in phrasing, terminology, and structure. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n**Translation 1** is well-structured and uses appropriate terminology. It correctly applies the dictionary terms, such as \"Responsible investment\" and \"ESG considerations.\" However, it uses \"the Exchange Fund\" consistently, which is acceptable, though \"EF\" is also an option from the dictionary.\n**Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, but it capitalizes \"Responsible investment\" inconsistently, which may be a stylistic choice but could be seen as less professional. It also uses \"the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives\" with an apostrophe, which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"the Exchange Fund's investment objectives.\"\n**Translation 3** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"the Exchange Fund\" consistently and applies the dictionary terms correctly.\n**Translation 4** is slightly more verbose and uses \"taking into account\" instead of \"considering,\" which is a valid synonym but slightly less direct. It also uses \"each investment\" instead of \"various investments,\" which is a minor but meaningful difference in scope. The structure is slightly more complex, which may affect readability.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 4 but uses \"investment projects\" instead of \"investment options,\" which is a slight deviation from the original. It also uses \"has already integrated\" instead of \"has integrated,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more wordy.\n**Translation 6** is very close to Translation 1, with the only notable difference being the use of \"the Exchange Fund’s\" with an apostrophe, which is again a matter of style rather than correctness.\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Responsible investment,\" \"sustainable long-term economic performance,\" \"public market investments,\" \"private market investments,\" \"ESG considerations,\" and \"Sustainability Report 2022.\"\n- The use of \"EF\" as an abbreviation for \"Exchange Fund\" is optional but not required unless the context demands brevity.\n- The phrase \"risk-adjusted long-term returns\" is more precise than \"long-term returns, adjusted for risk.\"\n- The use of \"investment projects\" instead of \"investment options\" is a minor but meaningful difference in meaning.\n- The capitalization of \"Responsible investment\" is inconsistent across translations, which may affect the perceived professionalism of the text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term economic performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce ESG-related risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to other investment options, the HKMA generally prioritizes ESG investments in accordance with established guiding principles and has incorporated ESG considerations into the investment management processes for both public market and private market investments of the Exchange Fund. Details regarding the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation can be found in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2022\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced unusual volatility, with bond and stock markets cumulatively falling by 16.2% and 19.8% respectively, representing significant declines.\n\nWeighed down by surging global inflation, tightening monetary policy, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices experienced sharp declines this year. Although global markets rebounded slightly at year-end amid expectations of inflation peaking and interest rates stabilizing, the U.S. S&P 500 Index still fell 19.4% for the year, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 15.5%.\n\nDue to aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks worldwide to combat inflation, government bond yields in major markets have continued to surge. US Treasury yields for the 10-year note have risen from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022 to above 4% in the fourth quarter, reaching their highest level since 2008. The US Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, with the degree of inversion continuing to widen, deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar significantly strengthened in 2022, driven by consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, yen, and renminbi, experienced substantial depreciation against the US dollar, with the pound sterling and yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2%, respectively.\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar significantly strengthened in 2022, driven by consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, yen, and renminbi, experienced substantial depreciation against the US dollar, with the pound sterling and yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Return\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and the precise use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Exchange Fund,\" \"investment-holding subsidiaries,\" \"Strategic Portfolio,\" \"valuation loss,\" and \"currency translation effect.\"\n- The numerical data and breakdowns are consistently accurate across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely similar, with minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"equity investment\" instead of \"stock investment,\" which is less precise in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"currency translation effect reduction,\" which is not accurate; the term should be \"currency translation effect\" without \"reduction.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"a currency translation effect of non-HKD assets amounting to HKD 40 billion,\" which is awkwardly phrased.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"downward adjustment in foreign currency valuation,\" which is more verbose than necessary and slightly changes the meaning.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"a HKD 40 billion decrease in currency translation effect,\" which is not accurate; the term is not a \"decrease\" but a \"valuation loss.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"offshore stock investment\" instead of \"overseas stock investment,\" which is less standard in financial reporting.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"stock investment\" consistently, as it is more standard in financial contexts.\n- Use \"currency translation effect\" without adding unnecessary modifiers like \"reduction\" or \"downward adjustment.\"\n- Ensure that the phrase \"non-HKD assets\" is clearly associated with the \"currency translation effect.\"\n- Maintain parallel structure in the list of losses for clarity and fluency.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, as it is the official name and more concise than \"The Exchange Fund.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, consistency, and precision in terminology while ensuring natural English flow.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HKD 205.4 billion in 2022, including a bond investment loss of HKD 53.2 billion, a stock investment loss of HKD 80.5 billion (comprising a loss of HKD 61 billion from overseas stock investments and a loss of HKD 19.5 billion from Hong Kong stock investments), a currency translation effect of HKD 40 billion on non-HKD assets, and a loss of HKD 31.7 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment-holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 400.8 billion. The total market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HKD 484.7 billion, of which private equity amounted to HKD 370 billion and real estate amounted to HKD 114.7 billion. The outstanding investment commitments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio amounted to HKD 270.8 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in style, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. It uses \"had a negative investment return\" and \"returning -8.6%\" consistently. However, \"returning -8.6%\" is slightly less formal than \"returned -8.6%.\" The use of \"since its inception in 2009\" is appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"recorded an investment return\" and \"achieved an annualised internal rate of return.\" The latter is more dynamic and slightly more formal, which may be preferable in a financial context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is nearly identical to the second, with no significant differences in content or style. It is also grammatically correct and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"BP\" instead of \"Backing Portfolio,\" which is acceptable as per the dictionary, but \"BP\" may be less clear to a general audience. The phrase \"Investment Portfolio Return\" is awkwardly capitalized and should be \"Investment Portfolio return.\" The structure \"since inception in 2009\" is slightly less natural than \"since its inception in 2009.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the second and third, but it uses \"delivering a Return of -8.6%\" and \"a Return of -0.4%,\" which is unnecessarily repetitive and inconsistent with the rest of the text. The use of \"since inception in 2009\" is slightly less natural than \"since its inception in 2009.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Strategic Portfolio\" without the article \"the,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"return rate\" instead of \"return,\" which is not ideal in this context. The phrase \"since the inception of investments in 2009\" is slightly wordy and less natural than \"since its inception in 2009.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Consistency in terminology is crucial, especially for terms like \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Backing Portfolio.\"\n- The use of \"return\" without unnecessary repetition or capitalization is preferable.\n- The phrase \"since its inception in 2009\" is more natural and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The use of \"EF\" or \"Exchange Fund\" should be consistent, but \"Exchange Fund\" is more reader-friendly unless the audience is familiar with the acronym.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022, with the Investment Portfolio returning -8.6% and the Backing Portfolio returning -0.4%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment returns for different periods. The average return of the Exchange Fund was 1.5% from 2020 to 2022, 2.3% from 2018 to 2022, 2.4% from 2013 to 2022, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund assets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, typical of official or financial documents. The key term \"外匯基金\" must be translated as either \"EF\" or \"Exchange Fund,\" with \"Exchange Fund\" being more descriptive and appropriate in this context.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund for the year 2022 are presented on pages 173 to 281.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate, formal, and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy with \"for the year 2022\" instead of \"2022 annual.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The audited 2022 annual financial statements of the Exchange Fund are on pages 173 to 281.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Are on\" is slightly less formal than \"are presented on.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Regarding the audited 2022 annual financial statements of the Exchange Fund, see pages 173 to 281.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"see\" as in the original Chinese, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Regarding\" adds unnecessary formality and is not used in the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"See pages 173 to 281 for the audited 2022 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Direct and mirrors the structure of the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial statements\" lacks the word \"annual,\" which is present in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The audited financial statements for the Exchange Fund for 2022 are presented on pages 173 to 281.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"For the Exchange Fund for 2022\" is slightly awkward and redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The audited 2022 financial statements of the Exchange Fund are shown on pages 173 to 281.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Are shown on\" is less formal than \"are presented on.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and mirror the structure of the original. It should use \"Exchange Fund\" as the term for \"外匯基金\" and include \"annual\" to match the original. The phrase \"see pages\" is appropriate as it reflects the original's directive tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nSee pages 173 to 281 for the audited 2022 annual financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Return (1994 to 2022)\n"}

檢討現行貨幣及金融體系的風險管理措施，識別可能存在的漏洞，並確保措施完善；及\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享宏觀監察資訊，從而提高金管局的宏觀監察能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權範圍如下：\n- 識別金管局面對的潛在風險及威脅，並制定策略以減輕有關影響；\n- 檢討各部門現行的風險管理制度，識別可能存在的漏洞及重大風險，並確保備有適當措施應付有關情況；\n- 統一風險評估準則及方法，並就所識別的風險釐定資源管理的優先次序；及\n- 鼓勵及加強金管局內部的風險管理文化，推動適當的授權及監控。\n\n金管局設有一套穩健的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋機構層面及部門層面的組織架構風險。機構層面的風險泛指涉及整體機構所面對的中期風險，或需要跨部門共同應對的風險。在執行過程中，各部門需按季檢討及匯報其潛在和新興風險，以及所提出之監控措施和緩解策略，再輔以由上而下的機構風險管理模式，由各部門的管理高層識別影響較廣泛的主要風險及建議緩解措施。有關評估會經由風險委員會定期審議和決定適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審核\n\n內部審核處獨立及客觀評估金管局的管治、風險管理及監控程序是否足夠及具成效。該處職能上向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會匯報，行政上向金管局總裁匯報。內部審核處採用風險為本的方法進行業務運作及資訊系統審核，涵蓋各重大風險範疇。在2022年，該處就金管局的儲備管理、銀行監管工作、貨幣與金融發展、資訊科技及其他機構職能共進行28項審核。審核結果顯示金管局備有足夠及有效的監控措施，以管理金管局運作所產生的風險。\n","terms":{"12個月預期信用虧損":["12-month

translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局\", \"Corporate Functions\" for \"機構職能\", \"professionalism\" for \"專業水準\", and \"media outlets\" for \"媒體\" in one instance.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about transparency, accountability, efficiency, and communication is preserved in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use inconsistent capitalization (e.g., \"Corporate Functions Department\" vs. \"corporate functions department\") and incorrect possessive forms (e.g., \"HKMA's\" vs. \"HKMA’s\").\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations repeat \"the HKMA\" unnecessarily, which can make the text feel verbose. For example, using \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" repeatedly can be replaced with \"HKMA\" for conciseness.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"broader society\" is used in several translations, which is acceptable, but \"the broader community\" may be more natural in English.\n- **Use of \"media outlets\":** Only one translation uses \"media outlets\" as specified in the dictionary, while others use \"media\" or \"social media,\" which is acceptable but not strictly following the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for \"金管局\" to maintain brevity and clarity.\n- Use \"Corporate Functions Department\" as a proper noun, with consistent capitalization.\n- Replace \"the broader society and markets\" with \"the broader community and markets\" for natural phrasing.\n- Use \"media outlets\" as specified in the dictionary for \"媒體.\"\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"HKMA\" instead of repeating \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Ensure grammatical consistency, such as using \"HKMA’s\" with an apostrophe for possessive form.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Corporate Functions Department supports the HKMA’s operations, maintaining high transparency and accountability, and demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, the HKMA maintains effective communication with the broader community and markets through traditional and social media outlets, its website, information centers, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has meticulously built a workforce emphasizing flexibility and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to respond to changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"即場訪問\" is translated as \"stand-up interviews,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" and \"媒體\" as \"media outlets.\" The translations are consistent in conveying the core message of the original text, which is about the HKMA's efforts to maintain transparency and public understanding through various media engagements in 2022.\nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and professional tone appropriate for an official report.\n- Correct use of numbers and event types.\n- Consistent structure and flow across all versions.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"maintains close contact\" while others use \"maintains close communication\" or \"maintains close contact with the media.\" While all are acceptable, \"maintains close communication\" may be slightly more natural in this context.\n- The verb used for organizing events varies between \"organized or participated,\" \"hosted or participated,\" and \"organized or participated.\" \"Hosted or participated\" may be more precise, as \"hosted\" implies a more active role in organizing events.\n- Some translations use \"physical and online events,\" while others use \"in-person and online events.\" \"In-person\" is more commonly used in formal English contexts.\n- The phrase \"a total of 492 bilingual press releases were issued during the year\" is repeated in several translations. While grammatically correct, it could be slightly more concise or varied in phrasing.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and professionalism of the original, use consistent and natural phrasing, and ensure that all dictionary terms are correctly applied.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe HKMA maintains close communication with media outlets to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the HKMA hosted or participated in a total of 112 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews, and 93 other public events. The HKMA also arranged 46 media interviews. A total of 492 bilingual press releases were issued throughout the year, and a large number of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA's main functions, the HKMA holds press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media outlets, covering topics such as Currency Board operations, green and sustainable finance, and Central Bank Digital Currencies.\n\nDifferent media outlets actively participated in the activities organized by the HKMA in 2022, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day summit received significant media attention, with over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending for coverage, resulting in approximately 1,000 news articles published in local, regional, and international media. In addition, live streaming was arranged for 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively engage with the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) operates six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube), which have attracted over 100,000 followers. In 2022, the HKMA launched a WeChat page to reach a broader audience. The HKMA uses social media to promote major events and initiatives, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the Government Green Bond Programme, and to enhance public awareness of various areas such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), financial technology (fintech), and scam protection.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, gave stand-up interviews to media outlets at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, delivered the opening keynote speech at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2022.\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, spoke at the \"Fintech Elite Forum 2022\" co-hosted by Cyberport and Accenture.\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosted a press conference to outline the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy stance on e-HKD.\n\nMr Darryl Chan, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, delivered a video address at the 2022 Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and vocabulary choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"banknotes and coins\" instead of \"paper currency and coins,\" which is acceptable. However, it uses \"involved\" for all categories, which may be repetitive.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"financial market infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI,\" which is more descriptive and appropriate in a formal context. It also uses \"about\" consistently, which improves readability.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"enquiries\" consistently and avoids repetition by using \"related to\" and \"the most frequent.\" However, it omits the article \"the\" before \"Public Enquiry Service,\" which is slightly less formal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is well-structured and grammatically correct. It separates the information about the number of inquiries into two sentences, improving readability. It uses \"a significant number of enquiries\" which is slightly more formal than \"the majority.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"citizens\" instead of \"the public,\" which is slightly less formal. It also uses \"consumer matters concerning banks\" instead of \"banking consumer matters,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is grammatically correct and uses \"financial infrastructure\" instead of \"FMI,\" which is more descriptive. It uses \"matters related to banking consumers,\" which is slightly less direct than \"banking consumer matters.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"FMI\" should be expanded to \"financial market infrastructure\" for clarity in a formal context.\n- \"Enquiries\" is more appropriate than \"inquiries\" in British English, which is likely the intended style.\n- \"The majority of these\" is more direct than \"a significant number of these\" or \"a larger number of these.\"\n- \"Banking consumer matters\" is more precise than \"consumer matters concerning banks.\"\n- \"Public Enquiry Service\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's main functions and operations. In 2022, it handled a total of 9,952 enquiries. Approximately half of these involved banking consumer matters, banking policies and regulations, banknotes and coins, financial market infrastructure, and debt market development. Among these, the majority of enquiries were related to the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2019, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Type\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Type\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"in-depth information and analysis\" is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"introducing the HKMA’s important measures and policies\" – \"important\" is slightly less formal than \"key\" or \"significant,\" but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with the addition of \"issues of\" for the reports, which is more precise. The use of \"key measures\" is better than \"important measures.\" However, \"public concerns\" is slightly less formal than \"matters of public concern.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first and second, with the only difference being the use of \"monetary, banking, and economic matters in Hong Kong\" instead of \"Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs.\" The former is slightly more formal and precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"thematic data and analysis,\" which is a good match for the original Chinese term \"專題資料與分析.\" However, \"key initiatives\" is slightly less precise than \"key measures\" or \"key policies.\" The phrase \"matters of public interest\" is slightly less formal than \"matters of public concern.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the fourth, with the only difference being the use of \"thematic data and analysis\" and \"matters of public concern.\" It is accurate and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"specialized information and analysis\" instead of \"in-depth\" or \"thematic,\" which is less precise. Also, \"currency\" is used instead of \"monetary,\" which is slightly less appropriate in this context. The use of \"banking sector\" is slightly more specific than \"banking affairs,\" which may not be ideal.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》\" should be translated as \"Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report.\"\n- \"金管局\" should be translated as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" with \"HKMA\" being more concise and commonly used.\n- \"《金融數據月報》\" should be \"Monthly Statistical Bulletin.\"\n- \"《季報》\" should be \"Quarterly Bulletin.\"\n- \"金管局《年報》\" should be \"HKMA Annual Report.\"\n- \"《匯思》文章\" should be \"inSight articles.\"\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" for brevity, \"Quarterly Bulletins\" for consistency, and \"inSight articles\" as per the dictionary. It should also use \"thematic data and analysis\" to match the original Chinese term \"專題資料與分析.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA publishes two Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Reports and four Quarterly Bulletins, and regularly updates the Monthly Statistical Bulletin with the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA has published 17 inSight articles introducing the HKMA’s key measures and policies, and discussing matters of public concern.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) receiving awards for its 2021 Annual Report. The translations provided by junior translators mostly capture the key information, but there are notable differences in structure, terminology, and accuracy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities: HKMA, Hong Kong Management Association, and the awards received.\n- Most translations use the correct dictionary terms, such as \"Silver Award,\" \"Certificate of Excellence,\" and \"Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** incorrectly translates \"環境、社會及管治匯報\" as \"Environmental reporting\" instead of the full \"Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\" as listed in the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** also misrepresents \"環境、社會及管治匯報\" as \"Social and Governance Reporting,\" omitting \"Environmental.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Social and Governance Reporting\" instead of the full term, which is a misrepresentation of the dictionary entry.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" instead of \"Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations,\" which is a slight variation but not a major issue.\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 4** are the most accurate, using the full and correct terms from the dictionary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"環境、社會及管治匯報\" is translated as \"Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations\" exactly as listed.\n- Maintain a consistent and formal tone, as the original text is a formal announcement.\n- Ensure that the structure clearly separates the two awards and their respective categories.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA's 2021 Annual Report received the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations\" category, as well as the Certificate of Excellence in the \"Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\" category, in the Hong Kong Management Association's 2022 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate Website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The website also contains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Stored Value Facility Licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative to release financial data and important information through Open APIs since 2018, with a total of 148 APIs launched by the end of 2022. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms: \"開放應用程式介面（開放API）\" can be translated as \"Open API\" or \"Open Application Programming Interface,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" and \"開放API\" as \"Open APIs\" or \"Open API.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"Open APIs\" appropriately. However, \"progressively releasing\" is slightly less natural than \"gradually releasing\" or \"releasing in phases.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is accurate and natural, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and \"sets of Open APIs\" to match the original's \"組.\" However, \"posted\" may not be the best term for \"載\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Open Application Programming Interface (Open API)\" is unnecessarily verbose and redundant. \"Open APIs\" is more concise and commonly used in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"HKMA\" is used without the full name initially, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the acronym. Also, \"in accordance with\" is slightly more formal than needed.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version is fluent and accurate, using \"in phases\" to match \"分階段\" and \"Open APIs\" appropriately. However, the use of \"has launched\" in the second sentence may imply the action is ongoing, which is not the case.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The translation is accurate and natural, using \"gradually releasing\" and \"in accordance with.\" However, \"hosted on its website\" may not be the best match for \"載的.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently after introducing the full name, use \"Open APIs\" for consistency with the dictionary, and ensure that the phrasing is natural and fluent in English. It should also accurately reflect the original's meaning that the APIs were released in phases and that the total number of APIs launched by the end of 2022 was 148.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been gradually releasing financial data and important information from its website through Open APIs since 2018. By the end of 2022, the HKMA had launched a total of 148 Open APIs on its website according to the original plan.\n\n# Information Center\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre and its purpose.\n- The structure of the Information Centre (exhibition hall and library) is consistently described.\n- The dictionary terms such as \"金管局\" (HKMA), \"國際金融中心2期\" (Two International Finance Centre), and \"《銀行業條例》\" (Banking Ordinance) are generally translated correctly.\n- The library's role in maintaining the \"register of authorized institutions and local representative offices\" and the \"register of securities staff\" is accurately reflected in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"AIs\" (authorized institutions) instead of the full term \"authorized institutions,\" which may be acceptable in certain contexts but should be consistent with the dictionary's options.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use phrases like \"in an interactive manner\" or \"through interactive displays,\" which are slightly repetitive. Others use \"data and exhibits\" instead of \"reference materials and exhibits,\" which may not fully capture the intended meaning.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"central banking\" is used correctly, but the phrase \"central banking affairs\" in some translations is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"central banking.\"\n- **Grammar and Syntax:** Minor grammatical issues, such as missing articles or prepositions, appear in some translations (e.g., \"the'register of authorized institutions...\" should be \"the'register of authorized institutions...\").\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the full term \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA\" consistently, depending on context.\n- Ensure that \"authorized institutions\" is used in full unless \"AIs\" is clearly appropriate and consistent.\n- Use \"reference materials and exhibits\" instead of \"data and exhibits\" to better reflect the academic and research-oriented nature of the Information Centre.\n- Maintain a consistent and natural flow by avoiding repetitive phrasing such as \"in an interactive manner\" or \"through interactive displays.\"\n- Ensure that the library's role in maintaining the required registers is clearly and accurately described, using the exact terms from the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre and serves as an important facility for introducing the Authority's work to the public and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector in an interactive manner, and also provides reference materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains, in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, the \"register of authorized institutions and local representative offices\" and the \"register of securities staff of authorized institutions,\" which are available for public reference.\n\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively restored its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively restored its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\n\nAfter renovation, the newly renovated library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\nThe original title, \"# 社區聯繫及公眾教育,\" translates to \"Community Contact and Public Education\" at face value. However, the junior translators have offered several variations, with \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" appearing most frequently. This choice is more idiomatic in English and better reflects the active, participatory nature of \"社區聯繫\" (community contact\/engagement), which implies more than just passive communication—it suggests involvement, interaction, and collaboration.\n\"Community Liaison\" and \"Community Contact\" are also valid translations, but they carry a more formal or administrative tone, which may not be the intended nuance. \"Community Engagement\" is widely used in public policy and social work contexts and is more inclusive and dynamic, making it the most appropriate choice.\nGiven the context and the need for fluency and cultural appropriateness, \"Community Engagement and Public Education\" is the most suitable translation. It is both natural in English and accurately reflects the intent of the original Chinese title.\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, the HKMA has been organizing the Public education programme since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held a webinar, attracting over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The webinar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the LERS, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, and opportunities in the banking industry. To date, the Public education programme has attracted over 65,000 participants.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"crossmedia awareness campaign,\" \"fraudulent hyperlinks,\" and \"Pay Later.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original message.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"phishing scams,\" \"SMS messages,\" and \"personal loans.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"credit card fraud\" instead of \"credit cards scams,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" instead of \"Pay Later\" or \"Buy Now.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"credit cards scams\" (correct), but \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"distributing tips\" instead of \"providing tips,\" which is less natural.\n- **Translation 3** is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage and fluency. It uses \"credit cards scams\" and \"Pay Later\" correctly. However, it uses \"communicates with the public\" instead of \"engages the public,\" which is slightly less idiomatic.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" instead of \"Pay Later\" or \"Buy Now,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"alert the public\" instead of \"remind the public,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"savvy\" instead of \"wise\" or \"smart,\" which is acceptable but less standard in this context. It also uses \"credit cards scams\" and \"Pay Later\" correctly.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Buy Now\" instead of \"Pay Later\" or \"Buy Now, Pay Later,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"savvy\" and \"guard against\" instead of \"be cautious of,\" which is slightly less natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Maintain natural, fluent English.\n- Use standard and idiomatic expressions.\n- Avoid redundancy or awkward phrasing.\nBased on this, **Translation 3** is the closest to the ideal, but it can be improved by using \"engages the public\" instead of \"communicates with the public\" and ensuring that \"Pay Later\" is used consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates and engages the public, reminding them how to be smart and responsible financial service consumers. In view of the increasing number of \"phishing\" scams, the HKMA has launched a crossmedia awareness campaign to further remind the public to be cautious of fraudulent hyperlinks contained in SMS messages and emails claiming to be from banks, and to be vigilant against other types of scams involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA has also organized radio and social media campaigns to provide tips on the smart use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods (including \"Pay Later\" products).\n\nA new short video titled \"Watch the Digital KEY Closely—Think Twice Before Clicking the LINK!\"\n\nTo assist citizens in keeping up with the development of financial technology services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promoted the use of electronic lai sees during the Lunar New Year through social media outlets and radio. The HKMA has produced animated short films explaining Open APIs and introducing matters to be noted when using banking services via mobile applications provided by third-party service providers, such as online shopping platforms and mortgage agencies. The animated films also introduce the App-to-App\/ Web-to-App payment function and advantages of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nAnimated short films can help enhance the public's digital financial literacy.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"金融業\" as \"financial sector,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" and \"見習經理計劃\" as \"Manager Trainee (MT) Programme.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message—that the HKMA is promoting public understanding and encouraging youth to join the organization—is well preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate verbs such as \"deepen,\" \"enhance,\" \"foster,\" and \"increase\" to convey the HKMA's efforts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in verb usage:** Some translations use \"strives to deepen\" or \"is committed to enhancing,\" which are all acceptable, but \"committed to deepening\" is more consistent with the original tone.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations, such as \"raising the interest of the younger generation in joining the HKMA and the industry,\" are slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing like \"fostering interest among the younger generation in joining the HKMA and the industry\" is preferable.\n- **Use of \"program\" vs. \"programme\":** The original uses \"見習經理計劃,\" which is translated as \"Manager Trainee (MT) Programme.\" The British spelling \"programme\" is appropriate, but some translations use \"program,\" which is also acceptable but less consistent with the original's style.\n- **\"Firsthand\" in Translation 5:** While \"firsthand\" is not incorrect, it adds a nuance not explicitly present in the original, which may be unnecessary.\n- **\"Series of interview videos\" in Translation 3:** The original mentions \"新製作的訪問短片,\" which is singular (\"newly produced interview video\"), not a series. This is a minor but important detail.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"committed to deepening\" to maintain consistency with the original tone.\n- Use \"fostering interest among the younger generation\" for conciseness and clarity.\n- Ensure consistency in spelling between \"programme\" and \"program\" based on the original's style.\n- Avoid adding unnecessary adverbs or adjectives that are not in the original.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA is also committed to deepening the public's understanding of the financial sector and fostering interest among the younger generation in joining the HKMA and the industry. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA Manager Trainee (MT) Programme share their experiences, not only introducing the programme's content to those interested in applying but also enhancing their understanding of the HKMA's work.\n\nManager Trainee (MT) Programme Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews\n\nTo enhance secondary school students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has co-organized the 8th consecutive \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship\" with multiple relevant institutions. This year's theme is Green and Sustainable Finance, through which students gain new knowledge via the online quiz (which has the highest number of participants in its history), webinars, and a design thinking competition.\n\nStudents in the design thinking competition presented creative solutions with green and sustainable elements to address the need for managing personal finances.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"online parenting educational campaign\" as required. The term \"Little Financial Managers\" is a good choice for the campaign name. However, \"school break\" is slightly less precise than \"school holiday\" or \"special holiday.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"Little Financial Experts\" for the campaign name, which is appropriate. The term \"school year\" is used instead of \"academic year,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable. The use of \"initiative\" is a minor stylistic choice.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but includes \"primary 1 students,\" which is not standard in English and may confuse readers. It also uses \"special holiday\" and \"summer vacation,\" which are acceptable, but the structure is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"school holiday\" twice, which is slightly repetitive but not incorrect. The term \"basic concepts of banks and payment services\" is slightly awkward compared to \"banking and payment services.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"public holiday\" for \"special holiday,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term. The term \"Little Financial Planner\" is a creative but less common choice for the campaign name.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"special holiday\" and \"summer vacation\" appropriately. The term \"Little Financial Wiz\" is a creative but less conventional choice for the campaign name.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"HKMA\" is preferred over the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for brevity and consistency.\n- \"Online parenting educational campaign\" is the exact term from the dictionary and should be used.\n- \"Little Financial Experts\" is a clear and appropriate name for the campaign.\n- \"Special holiday\" and \"summer vacation\" are the most accurate terms for the given context.\n- \"Academic year\" is more formal and appropriate than \"school year.\"\n- The structure should be concise and natural, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA launched the \"Little Financial Experts\" online parenting educational campaign during the special holiday in March and the summer vacation in August of the 2021-22 academic year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, making simple toys, and sharing sessions with experts in finance and early childhood education, the campaign helped kindergarten and primary school students learn basic concepts of banknotes and coins, banking and payment services, and financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills through online learning.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central banking operations, including Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs) and other applicable reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard). The Finance Division prepares the Exchange Fund Financial Statements in accordance with HKFRSs, with the assistance of external auditors and other accounting professionals. Furthermore, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of each expenditure item and budget data in the Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the HKMA's most important tasks. Risk management is not only reflected in strategic planning but also applied at the operational level. The HKMA's risk management framework includes two high-level committees, namely the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee; both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in tone, fluency, and precision that warrant a critical evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Macro Surveillance Committee\" and \"HKMA\" (or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\").\n- The structure of the bullet points is consistent across translations, maintaining the original list format.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use \"scope of duties\" while others use \"scope of authority\" or \"mandate.\" While all are acceptable, \"scope of authority\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Verb usage:** Some translations use \"discuss feasible measures\" or \"discuss feasible countermeasures.\" \"Countermeasures\" is more precise than \"measures\" in the context of addressing risks and threats.\n- **Consistency in phrasing:** Some translations use \"ensure the measures are comprehensive,\" while others use \"ensure the measures are sound\" or \"ensure the effectiveness of these measures.\" \"Comprehensive\" is more aligned with the original Chinese term \"完善\" (to improve or perfect).\n- **Use of \"HKMA\" vs. \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\":** While both are acceptable, \"HKMA\" is more concise and commonly used in official contexts.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"scope of authority\" for consistency and precision.\n- Use \"countermeasures\" to reflect the proactive response to risks.\n- Use \"comprehensive\" to align with the original intent of \"完善\" (to improve or perfect).\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency with official terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe scope of authority of the Macro Surveillance Committee is as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats facing Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible countermeasures;\n- Review existing risk management measures in the monetary and financial system, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macro surveillance information to enhance the HKMA's macro surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and structure. All translations correctly use \"Risk Committee\" and \"HKMA\" as specified in the dictionary. However, there are subtle variations in phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original Chinese meaning.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent across all translations, as required.\n- The structure of the bullet points is maintained, preserving the original format.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate vocabulary.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"scope of authority\" while others use \"responsibilities\" or \"mandate.\" \"Scope of authority\" is the most precise term in this context, as it reflects the defined powers and duties of the Risk Committee.\n- The term \"vulnerabilities\" is used in some translations, while others use \"gaps\" or \"weaknesses.\" \"Vulnerabilities\" is more precise in the context of risk management.\n- The phrase \"drive appropriate delegation and monitoring\" in one translation is less common than \"promote appropriate delegation and monitoring.\"\n- Some translations use \"facilitate appropriate authorization and monitoring,\" which is less direct than \"promote appropriate authorization and monitoring.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"scope of authority\" consistently to reflect the formal definition of the committee's powers.\n- Use \"vulnerabilities\" to maintain precision in the risk management context.\n- Use \"promote appropriate delegation and monitoring\" for consistency and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"scope of authority,\" \"vulnerabilities,\" and \"promote appropriate delegation and monitoring\" to ensure clarity, precision, and consistency.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Risk Committee’s scope of authority is as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats faced by the HKMA and develop strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Review the existing risk management systems of various departments, identify potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensure appropriate measures are in place to address these situations;\n- Standardize risk assessment criteria and methods, and determine the priority of resource management based on identified risks; and\n- Encourage and strengthen the risk management culture within the HKMA, promoting appropriate delegation and monitoring.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Risk Committee,\" \"entity level,\" \"department level,\" \"controls,\" \"mitigating strategies,\" and \"risk management framework.\"\n- Most translations maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory or institutional texts.\n- The structure of the original text is generally preserved, with clear segmentation of ideas.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"organisational risk management model\" instead of \"organisational risk management approach,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"mitigation measures\" instead of \"mitigating strategies.\"\n- **Translation 2** is very accurate and uses the correct terms. However, it uses \"medium-term\" instead of \"mid-term,\" which is a minor stylistic choice.\n- **Translation 3** correctly uses \"monitoring measures\" instead of \"monitoring controls,\" which is a deviation from the dictionary. It also includes \"on a quarterly basis,\" which is not in the original text.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Organisational risk management\" with a capital \"O,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"cross-departmental response\" instead of \"cross-departmental collaboration.\"\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly translates \"risk management framework\" as \"risk management framework covering Organisational risk management and department level structures,\" which misrepresents the original meaning. It also uses \"controls\" instead of \"mitigating strategies.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, but it uses \"monitoring measures\" instead of \"monitoring controls\" and \"coordinated responses\" instead of \"cross-departmental collaboration.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Maintain the formal tone and clarity of the original.\n- Avoid adding or omitting information not present in the original.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural English flow.\nBased on this, the best version would be a synthesis of the strongest elements from the translations, particularly from Translation 2 and 6, while strictly adhering to the dictionary terms and avoiding unnecessary additions or stylistic deviations.\n---\nThe HKMA has established a robust operational risk management framework covering organisational risk management at both the entity level and department level. Entity-level risks generally refer to mid-term risks facing the entire institution or risks requiring cross-departmental collaboration. During implementation, each department is required to review and report on its potential and emerging risks, as well as the controls and mitigating strategies proposed, supported by a top-down organisational risk management approach. Senior management of each department identifies major risks with broader impacts and recommends mitigating strategies. These assessments are regularly reviewed and deliberated by the Risk Committee to determine appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is a single term, \"內部審核,\" which is directly translated as \"Internal audit\" according to the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used the term \"Internal audit\" in their translations, with the only variation being the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations. The \"#\" symbol is not part of the original text and appears to be an unnecessary addition, likely due to formatting errors or misunderstandings by the junior translators.\nThe most accurate and appropriate translation is simply \"Internal audit,\" without any additional symbols. This translation is concise, accurate, and adheres to the dictionary's specified term. It is also the most fluent and natural in English, as it is a standard term used in business and accounting contexts. The use of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is not only unnecessary but may also be misleading, as it is typically used for headings or labels in formatted documents, which is not the case here.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is \"Internal audit.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Internal Audit Division,\" \"EFAC,\" \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"HKMA,\" \"risk-based approach,\" \"controls,\" and \"corporate functions.\" However, there are subtle variations in phrasing and tone that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning of the original text.\n- They correctly use the required dictionary terms.\n- The structure and flow of the sentences are largely consistent with standard English business writing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"controls\" instead of \"monitoring processes\" in the first sentence, which slightly alters the original meaning.\n- The use of \"functionally\" and \"administratively\" is consistent, but the placement of these adverbs can vary slightly, affecting readability.\n- Some translations use \"sufficient and effective\" while others use \"adequate and effective,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"adequate and effective\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The phrase \"covering all major risk areas\" is used in some translations, while others use \"covering all material risk areas.\" \"Material\" is more commonly used in audit contexts, but \"major\" is also acceptable.\n- The use of \"conducted a total of 28 audits\" is slightly more verbose than necessary; \"conducted 28 audits\" is more concise and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"adequate and effective\" or \"sufficient and effective\" based on the intended tone.\n- Use \"material risk areas\" if the context is formal or audit-related.\n- Maintain a consistent structure for reporting lines (e.g., \"Functionally, it reports to... and administratively, it reports to...\").\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently unless the full name is needed for clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the HKMA’s governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. Functionally, it reports to the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively, it reports to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in conducting its operations and information system audits, covering all material risk areas. In 2022, the Division conducted 28 audits on the HKMA’s reserves management, banking supervisory activities, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other corporate functions. The audit results showed that the HKMA has adequate and effective controls to manage the risks arising from its operations.\n"}

意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023

the Director of Audit  \n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Director of Audit's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which are set out on pages 179 to 281. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2022, and the income and expenditure account, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and truly and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2022, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six translations provided. All translations accurately incorporate the required dictionary terms, with \"Chief Executive,\" \"section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"Audit Commission,\" and \"Group\" translated correctly. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and clarity.\nThe first translation is fluent and grammatically sound, with natural phrasing such as \"in accordance with\" and \"support my audit opinion.\" It correctly uses \"Commitments\" only where appropriate and avoids awkward phrasing.\nThe second translation is also strong, with a slightly more formal tone and precise use of \"audit standards\" and \"maintained independence.\" It avoids the awkward use of \"Commitments\" as a noun in place of a verb, which appears in some other translations.\nThe third translation introduces \"directions\" instead of \"instructions,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this formal context. It also incorrectly uses \"Commitments\" as a noun in the phrase \"include Commitments,\" which is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the flow.\nThe fourth translation uses \"guidelines\" instead of \"standards,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary term but still acceptable. However, it incorrectly uses \"Commitments\" as a noun in \"The responsibilities I am required to Commitments,\" which is grammatically incorrect.\nThe fifth translation is very strong, with natural phrasing and correct use of \"Commitments\" as a verb. It avoids awkward constructions and maintains a professional tone throughout.\nThe sixth translation is the weakest, as it incorrectly uses \"Commitments\" as a noun in multiple places, such as \"The Commitments I must assume\" and \"other ethical Commitments,\" which is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the meaning.\nBased on this review, the best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use \"audit standards\" consistently, and avoid using \"Commitments\" as a noun. It should also use natural phrasing such as \"in accordance with\" and \"provide a basis for my audit opinion.\"\nImproved Translation:\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. The responsibilities I have incurred in accordance with those standards are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with those standards, I have been independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriately provides a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters in the course of auditing the financial statements as a whole and forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe title \"按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\" translates to \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this title, with minor variations in wording and capitalization.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Accounted for at Fair Value,\" while the second, third, and fifth use \"Measured at Fair Value.\" In financial terminology, \"measured at fair value\" is the more commonly used and accurate phrase in accounting standards such as IFRS and GAAP. \"Accounted for at fair value\" is less precise and may imply a different accounting treatment.\nThe use of \"Valuation\" at the beginning of the title is appropriate, as it directly corresponds to \"估值\" in the original text. However, the capitalization of \"Valuation\" and the rest of the title is inconsistent across translations. The most professional and consistent approach is to capitalize only the first word of the title, unless it is a heading in a document that requires full capitalization.\nThe dictionary provides two options for \"金融資產\": \"financial assets\" and \"financial asset.\" The plural form \"financial assets\" is more appropriate in this context, as the title refers to a category of assets rather than a single asset.\nThe term \"金融負債\" is consistently translated as \"financial liabilities\" in all translations, which is correct and aligns with the dictionary entry.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be:\nValuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 12,074.98 billion.\n\n87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or are estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe original text discusses the fair value of financial assets, specifically the 13% portion that is estimated using valuation techniques not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters), and the total value of these assets, which is primarily composed of unlisted investment funds.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"is valued\" instead of \"fair value,\" which slightly misrepresents the original term. Also, the number \"487.69 billion\" is missing the comma, which could be confusing.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"fair value\" and \"estimated using valuation techniques.\" The number is written as \"487.694 billion HKD,\" which is precise. However, the use of \"amount to\" is slightly less formal than \"amounts to.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"was estimated\" in the past tense, which is acceptable but not necessary unless the context implies a past event. The number is correctly formatted as \"487.694 billion HKD.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very similar to the second, with the only difference being the use of \"totaled\" instead of \"amount to.\" Both are acceptable, but \"amount to\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation has a critical error: it incorrectly translates \"4,876.94億港元\" as \"4,876.94 billion HKD\" instead of \"487.694 billion HKD.\" This is a significant numerical error. Also, \"third-level parameters\" is less standard than \"Level 3 parameters.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"fair value\" correctly, \"estimated using valuation techniques,\" and \"amount to.\" The number is correctly formatted as \"487.694 billion HKD.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"that rely on parameters\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"fair value\" as in the original.\n- Use \"Level 3 parameters\" as the standard term.\n- Correctly format the number \"487.694 billion HKD.\"\n- Use \"amount to\" or \"amounts to\" for consistency with financial reporting.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets amount to HKD 487.694 billion, mainly consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related controls;  \n- Evaluating and testing controls, including relevant application controls for computer systems;  \n- Obtaining external confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If quoted prices are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original Chinese text is a heading or title, likely from a financial or accounting document. The key term \"投資物業\" must be translated as \"investment properties\" as specified in the dictionary. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in structure and formality.\nThe first translation, \"Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value,\" is grammatically correct and uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is a common term in accounting standards. However, it lacks the capitalization and formatting that might be expected in a formal document heading.\nThe second translation, \"Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value,\" is more formal and uses \"Accounted for at Fair Value,\" which is also a standard term in accounting. However, the phrase \"Accounted for\" may be slightly less precise than \"Carried at\" in this context.\nThe third translation, \"The investment properties are valued at fair value,\" is a complete sentence and less likely to be used as a heading. It is more descriptive than formal and may not be appropriate for a title.\nThe fourth and fifth translations both use the hashtag symbol (#) and are formatted similarly to the original Chinese text. They are more consistent with the structure of a heading but may not be necessary unless the original document uses such formatting.\nThe sixth translation, \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value,\" is the most accurate and appropriate. It uses \"Carried at Fair Value,\" which is a standard and precise term in accounting for assets measured at fair value. It is also properly capitalized and formatted as a heading.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value,\" as it is precise, formal, and consistent with accounting terminology.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 of the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in terminology, phrasing, and numerical formatting. A critical review of each translation reveals the following:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"amounting to 23.394 billion HKD\" and \"39.631 billion HKD.\" These figures are incorrect; the original text specifies **233.94億港元** and **396.31億港元**, which should be **233.94 billion HKD** and **396.31 billion HKD**, respectively. The use of \"valued at\" and \"determined based on the valuations by\" is appropriate, but the numerical errors undermine accuracy.\n2. **Translation 2** correctly uses \"233.94 billion HKD\" and \"396.31 billion HKD.\" It also uses \"valuation techniques\" for \"估值方法\" and \"principal activities\" for \"主要業務,\" both of which are accurate. The phrasing \"the fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures\" is slightly wordy but grammatically sound.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"23.394 billion HKD\" and \"39.631 billion HKD,\" which are incorrect. It also uses \"equity interests\" for \"擁有權益,\" which is slightly less precise than \"interests.\" The phrase \"aggregate value\" is appropriate, and the use of \"valuation techniques\" is correct.\n4. **Translation 4** correctly uses \"23.394 billion HKD\" and \"39.631 billion HKD.\" It uses \"carrying amount\" for \"價值,\" which is slightly more technical than necessary. The phrase \"whether held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures\" is clear and natural.\n5. **Translation 5** correctly uses \"23.394 billion HKD\" and \"39.631 billion HKD.\" It uses \"mainly engage in\" for \"主要業務,\" which is slightly informal. The phrase \"the aggregate value of these interests is\" is clear and natural.\n6. **Translation 6** correctly uses \"233.94 billion HKD\" and \"396.31 billion HKD.\" It uses \"principal activities involve holding\" for \"主要業務為持有,\" which is accurate. The phrase \"regardless of whether they are held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Ensure the correct numerical values are used: **233.94 billion HKD** and **396.31 billion HKD**.\n- Use \"valuation techniques\" for \"估值方法\" and \"independent professional valuers\" for \"獨立專業估值師.\"\n- Use \"principal activities\" for \"主要業務.\"\n- Use \"interests\" for \"擁有權益\" rather than \"equity interests\" or \"carrying amount.\"\n- Use \"whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures\" for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in 4 associates and 22 joint ventures, whose principal activities are holding overseas investment properties, with the related interests valued at HKD 396.31 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate. The use of \"valuer\" is appropriate, and the structure is well-organized. However, \"valuations stated in those valuation reports\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with the only notable difference being the use of \"valuation experts\" instead of \"valuer.\" While \"valuation experts\" is not incorrect, \"valuer\" is more standard in audit and accounting contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate, but it incorrectly uses \"valuation methods\" instead of \"valuations\" in the phrase \"valuation methods specified in the relevant valuation reports.\" This is a misapplication of the dictionary term \"估值方法\" (valuation techniques), which should not be used to refer to the actual valuations listed in the reports.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best, but it incorrectly uses \"valuation techniques\" instead of \"valuations\" in the phrase \"valuation techniques stated in the relevant valuation reports.\" This is a misapplication of the dictionary term \"估值方法\" (valuation techniques), which should not be used to refer to the actual valuations listed in the reports.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"carried at fair value,\" which is a slightly more formal and precise term than \"accounted for at fair value\" or \"measured at fair value.\" It also correctly uses \"valuation methods\" in the last bullet point, which is appropriate for the term \"估值方法.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is standard in accounting terminology. It also correctly uses \"valuation techniques\" for \"估值方法\" and \"valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports\" for the first bullet point.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"measured at fair value\" is the most standard and precise in accounting contexts.\n- \"Valuation techniques\" is the correct translation for \"估值方法.\"\n- \"Valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports\" is the most accurate and natural phrasing for \"根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定.\"\n- \"Valuers\" is the standard term in audit and accounting contexts, not \"valuation experts\" or \"valuation methods.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This information includes all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2022 Annual Report, but excludes the financial statements and the auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances known to me during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of two entities—**金融管理專員** (Monetary Authority) and **外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會** (Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee)—regarding **財務報表** (financial statements). The dictionary specifies that **承擔** must be translated as **Commitments**, which is a key term to consider.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**: \"Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" from the dictionary. The structure is clear and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"responsibilities\" instead of \"Commitments\" as required by the dictionary. This is a critical error since the dictionary explicitly specifies **承擔** must be translated as **Commitments**.\n2. **Translation 2**: \"Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's responsibilities regarding the financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the terms from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same issue as Translation 1—uses \"responsibilities\" instead of \"Commitments.\" Also, the possessive form \"Committee's\" is awkward in this context.\n3. **Translation 3**: \"The Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s responsibilities regarding the financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of terms from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Again, uses \"responsibilities\" instead of \"Commitments.\" The possessive form is also awkward.\n4. **Translation 4**: \"The Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee have Commitments regarding the financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Commitments\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"have Commitments\" is awkward and not idiomatic in formal titles. \"Commitments\" should be used as a noun in a more formal and concise structure.\n5. **Translation 5**: \"The responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Formal and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"responsibilities\" instead of \"Commitments\" as required by the dictionary.\n6. **Translation 6**: \"Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's Commitments regarding the financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Commitments\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The possessive form \"Committee's\" is awkward and not ideal for a formal title.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe key issue across all translations is the use of **\"responsibilities\"** instead of **\"Commitments\"** as specified in the dictionary. Additionally, the possessive form and phrasing like \"have Commitments\" are not ideal for a formal title.\nThe best approach is to use **\"Commitments\"** as required and structure the sentence in a formal, concise, and grammatically correct manner. A title should be clear, direct, and avoid unnecessary prepositions or possessive forms.\n### Final Translation:\n**Commitments of the Monetary Authority and the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements**\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"Monetary Authority,\" \"HKICPA,\" \"section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"Chief Executive,\" and \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about preparing accurate financial statements and implementing internal controls is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of \"material misstatements\" and \"resulting from fraud or error\" is consistent across translations and accurately reflects the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verbosity and Redundancy:** Some translations, such as the first and second, use \"must be responsible for preparing\" and \"must also implement,\" which can be simplified for better fluency.\n- **Word Choice:** The fifth translation uses \"accurate and fair\" instead of \"true and fair,\" which is less standard in financial reporting contexts. \"True and fair\" is the conventional phrasing in accounting and auditing.\n- **Tense and Voice:** The first and second translations use \"must be responsible for preparing\" and \"must also implement,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more rigid than the more natural \"is responsible for preparing... and implementing.\"\n- **Fluency and Flow:** The fourth and sixth translations use \"is responsible for preparing... and for implementing,\" which is more fluid and natural in English legal and financial writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"true and fair\" as the standard phrase in financial reporting.\n- Use \"is responsible for\" rather than \"must be responsible for\" to reflect a duty or role rather than a requirement.\n- Use \"implementing\" rather than \"implementing... that it considers necessary\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure that the sentence flows smoothly without unnecessary repetition or wordiness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the HKICPA and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls as it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is straightforward and grammatically sound in Traditional Chinese. The junior translators have all produced nearly identical translations, with only minor differences in punctuation (use of “’s” vs. “'s”) and the choice of \"EFAC\" versus the full name \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" \nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" as the subject.\n- The term \"Group\" is correctly used for \"集團.\"\n- The structure and meaning of the sentence are preserved accurately in all translations.\nWeaknesses:\n- There is no variation in the translations, which suggests a lack of critical thinking or creativity in the translation process.\n- The use of \"EFAC\" is not consistent across translations, but the full name is more appropriate in formal contexts unless \"EFAC\" is a well-established acronym in the relevant field.\n- The punctuation (apostrophe style) is inconsistent, though this is a minor issue.\nImprovements:\n- Use the full name \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Group\" for \"集團.\"\n- Use the correct apostrophe style (\"’s\") as per English punctuation norms.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission’s audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may be caused by fraud or error, and they are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, could influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several key observations can be made regarding translation quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary terms:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Audit Commission,\" \"Group,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"accounting policies,\" \"auditor’s report.\" However, the term \"承擔\" is translated as \"Commitments\" in translations 1 and 6, which is incorrect. \"承擔\" should be translated as \"take responsibility\" or \"bear responsibility,\" not \"Commitments.\" This is a critical error that needs correction.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Most translations are fluent and grammatically sound. However, some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"I bear all responsibility for my audit opinion and my Commitments\" (Translation 1), which is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear. Similarly, \"I bear full Commitments for my audit opinion\" (Translation 5) is also incorrect.\n3. **Vocabulary and Nuance**: The term \"專業懷疑態度\" is translated as \"questioning mind\" (Translation 1), \"professional skepticism\" (Translations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). \"Professional skepticism\" is the more standard and precise term in auditing contexts, so this is a strength in most translations.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience familiar with auditing standards and terminology.\n5. **Consistency**: Translations 2, 3, 4, and 6 are more consistent in their use of terminology and structure. Translation 1 and 5 have minor inconsistencies and awkward phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement**: The best translation should use \"professional skepticism\" for \"專業懷疑態度,\" \"take full responsibility\" for \"承擔,\" and avoid the incorrect use of \"Commitments.\" It should also maintain a formal and precise tone, consistent with auditing standards.\n---\nIn the course of conducting an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission’s auditing standards, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those resulting from error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority, and the reasonableness of its accounting estimates and related disclosures;\n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw users’ attention to the related disclosures in the auditor’s report. If those disclosures are inadequate, I must issue a qualified auditor’s report. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly represent transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to form an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit of the plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"auditor’s report.\" However, there are variations in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and clarity of meaning.\nThe first translation is fluent and grammatically sound, but it uses \"unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure of a matter\" which is slightly awkward. The second translation is also clear and accurate, but the phrase \"where I determine that the adverse consequences... would outweigh the public interest\" is slightly less precise than some alternatives. The third translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning, but the phrase \"would be expected to result in negative consequences that outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication\" is slightly wordy. The fourth translation is concise and accurate, but \"laws and regulations prohibit disclosure of a matter\" is slightly less formal than \"prohibit public disclosure of a matter.\" The fifth translation is very accurate and uses \"legal restriction preventing the disclosure of a particular matter,\" which is slightly more specific than necessary. The sixth translation is very close to the original, but \"discussions\" is a slight misrepresentation of \"communication\" in this context.\nThe best translation would retain the clarity and formality of the original while ensuring grammatical accuracy and natural English flow. It should use \"prohibit public disclosure of a matter\" to maintain consistency with the original intent, and it should clearly convey the rare circumstances where disclosure is not made due to the potential negative consequences outweighing the public interest.\nBased on this review, the improved translation would be:\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit SubCommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the current period's financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless legal regulations prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where there is a reasonable expectation that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\nDirector of Audit  \nProfessor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nAudit Commission  \nHong Kong  \n66 Des Voeux Road Central\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text consists of three lines: \"審計署\", \"香港\", and \"金鐘道66號\". The dictionary specifies that \"審計署\" must be translated as \"Audit Commission\". All junior translators correctly used this term, so that part is consistent across all translations.\nThe second line, \"香港\", is straightforward and correctly translated as \"Hong Kong\" in all versions.\nThe third line, \"金鐘道66號\", presents the main challenge. This is an address, and the accuracy of the street name is crucial for clarity and correctness. The correct translation of \"金鐘道\" is \"Des Voeux Road Central\", which is the official English name of the street in Hong Kong. \n- The **first junior translator** used \"Des Voeux Road Central\", which is accurate and appropriate.\n- The **second junior translator** used \"Tim Mei Avenue, Admiralty\", which is incorrect. \"Tim Mei Avenue\" is not the correct name for \"金鐘道\", and \"Admiralty\" is a district, not a street name.\n- The **third junior translator** used \"Queen's Road Central\", which is a different street in Hong Kong and thus incorrect.\n- The **fourth junior translator** used a direct transliteration \"Jinzhong Road\", which is not the official English name and could confuse readers unfamiliar with the area.\n- The **fifth junior translator** used \"Connaught Road Central\", which is another incorrect street name.\n- The **sixth junior translator** used \"Gin Drinkers' Road\", which is a colloquial or informal name for \"金鐘道\" and not suitable for an official address.\nThe best translation is the one that uses the official and widely recognized English name of the street. Therefore, the first junior translator's version is the most accurate and appropriate. It correctly uses \"Des Voeux Road Central\" and maintains the correct format for an address. \nThe final translation should follow this model, ensuring that the address is both accurate and in line with official usage in Hong Kong.\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
