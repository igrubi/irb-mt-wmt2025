{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對逆境的韌性\n\n在評估六位初級翻譯的版本後，可以看出他們在整體語意傳達上都大致正確，但在語句流暢度、用詞精準度與語序自然度上仍有改進空間。以下為主要觀察與改進建議：\n1. **語序與語意連貫性**：部分翻譯在語序上略顯生硬，例如「在全球經濟成長放緩，且處於「高利率維持較長時間」環境下」這樣的結構，雖然語意正確，但語序可更自然，例如調整為「在全球經濟成長放緩，且處於「高利率維持較長時間」的環境下」。\n2. **用詞精準度**：部分翻譯在用詞上略顯不一致，例如「銀行動盪」與「銀行風波」、「壓力」與「壓力事件」等，應統一使用更符合金融語境的詞彙，如「銀行危機」或「銀行壓力」。\n3. **語句流暢度**：部分翻譯在語句連接上略顯斷裂，例如「不僅來自俄烏戰爭與中美關係緊張，亦包括中東地區爆發衝突，這些因素對市場造成重大影響」，語意雖正確，但語句結構可更緊湊。\n4. **文化與語境適應性**：部分翻譯在語境上略顯直譯，例如「在...情況下」的使用，應根據語境選擇更自然的語序與連接詞。\n5. **詞彙選擇**：根據詞典要求，所有英文關鍵詞必須使用指定的中文翻譯，例如「tensions」必須翻譯為「緊張」、「themes」為「主題」、「slowing」為「放緩」等，需確保這些詞彙正確使用。\n基於以上觀察，最佳翻譯應在語意準確、語序自然、用詞精準與語境適應性之間取得平衡，並嚴格遵循詞典中的翻譯要求。\n---\n在全球經濟成長放緩，且處於「高利率維持較長時間」的環境下，加上地緣政治緊張局勢加劇——不僅源於俄烏戰爭與中美關係緊張，亦包括中東地區衝突的爆發——成為2023年金融市場的關鍵主題。美國與歐洲三月的銀行危機，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力，進一步壓抑市場情緒。主要經濟體面臨貨幣政策收緊所帶來的嚴峻現實，以及對通貨膨脹路徑與利率展望的更大不確定性。此外，中國大陸經濟復甦的步伐，較市場普遍預期為慢，亦增添不確定性。\n\n在評估六位初級翻譯的版本後，可以看出他們在整體語意傳達上都大致正確，但在語法、用詞選擇、語氣流暢度與文化適應性方面仍有改進空間。以下為主要觀察與建議：\n1. **語法與用詞準確性**：多數翻譯正確使用了詞典中指定的對應詞彙，如「適應」、「韌性」、「開放」、「逐步」等。然而，部分翻譯在語法結構上略顯生硬，例如「人民」與「城市」的搭配在某些語境中顯得不自然，建議使用「市民」或「居民」更符合中文語境。\n2. **語氣與流暢度**：翻譯中有些句子結構過於直譯，導致語氣不夠自然。例如「幫助向世界發出信息」可改為「向世界傳達信息」，更符合中文表達習慣。\n3. **文化適應性**：部分翻譯中對機構名稱的處理不一致，如「Bank for International Settlements (BIS)」應統一翻譯為「國際清算銀行（BIS）」，而非「國際貨幣基金組織」或「國際銀行間銀行」。\n4. **語境與語意準確性**：某些翻譯在語意傳達上略顯偏差，例如「回復到我們多變的城市」中的「回復」與「多變」搭配不當，應改為「重返我們這座多變的城市」。\n5. **語序與邏輯性**：部分句子語序不自然，如「去年已進行大量工作」應調整為「自去年以來，已進行大量工作」，以符合中文語序。\n基於以上觀察，最佳翻譯應在語法正確、語意準確、語氣自然、文化適應性良好之間取得平衡，並確保所有指定詞彙正確使用。\n---\n在全球金融市場的波動與難以預測成為「新常態」的背景下，香港再次證明了其知名適應能力，展現出顯著的韌性。自去年香港疫情後全面重啟以來，已進行多項工作，以吸引市民重返我們這座多變的城市，並與香港重新建立聯繫。香港金融管理局透過舉辦一系列大型國際活動，例如全球金融領袖投資峰會及與國際清算銀行（BIS）的會議，展示了我們活躍的城市面貌，並幫助向世界傳達信息，表明香港作為主要國際金融中心（IFC），持續開放營商，並仍是行動與創新之中心。目前已有明顯跡象顯示經濟正在逐步復甦，這是由於入境旅遊的鼓舞人心復甦及私人消費的改善所推動，同時也受到具韌性的勞動市場以及政府推出的不同支持措施的支持。就全年而言，2023年香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的負面領域回升至3.2%。\n\n香港金融管理局於2023年進入其第四個十年。過去30年來，經濟和金融市場的動態發生了巨大變化，科技推動的進步遠超任何人最天馬行空的想像。過去三十年累積的寶貴經驗和智慧，使我們得以以信心面對未來。儘管面臨宏觀經濟逆風和不確定的外部環境，香港金融管理局將繼續維護其保護香港貨幣和銀行體系穩定的使命，並積極推動發展機會，以鞏固這種穩定性，並鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n前任及現任香港特別行政區財政司司長及香港金融管理局（HKMA）總裁在慶祝香港金融管理局三十週年聚會上合照：（從左至右）葉志雄先生、唐英年先生、曾蔭權先生、陳茂波先生、余偉文先生、梁錦松先生、曾俊華先生及陳德霖先生。\n\n# LERS — 穿越風暴的考驗\n\n去年標誌著聯繫匯率制度（LERS）40周年，該制度是支持香港雄厚且穩健的貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。四十年來透明且有效的運作，培養了市場對LERS的信心及其可信性。全年來，港元匯率維持在可兌換範圍內，港元市場運作暢順，反映市場對LERS的強大信心，這種信心亦獲國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者所共鳴和表達。\n\n信心背後，是香港金融管理局（HKMA）在公眾及市場活動中所作出的積極努力，以及有效的監測措施。我們在本年度不遺餘力與主要持份者溝通，以促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，這在波動時期尤為重要，無論波動源於經濟壓力或政治不確定因素。我們亦加強了對貨幣體系的監測，藉使用交易倉庫的數據集、拓展銀行的細粒度數據，以及運用先進的數據分析和人工智能，提升我們的能力，讓我們能進行更及時和全面的金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測分析。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 穩定的重要來源\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a concise heading: **\"Banking system — A major source of stability\"**. The key term to be translated exactly is **\"Source\"**, which must be rendered as **\"資料來源\"** from the dictionary.\n**Translation Analysis:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *# 銀行體系 — 穩定的重要來源*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"資料來源\" for \"source\" and maintains the structure of the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"穩定的重要來源\" is slightly awkward in Chinese, as \"重要來源\" is more naturally paired with \"資料\" (data) than \"穩定\" (stability).  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable, but could be more fluent.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *銀行系統——主要的資料來源，是穩定的大宗。*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"資料來源\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"穩定的大宗\" is unidiomatic and awkward. \"大宗\" typically refers to a large quantity or bulk, not a source of stability.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Poorly phrased and unnatural.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *# 銀行體系 — 穩定性的重要資料來源*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"資料來源\" and adds \"性\" to \"穩定\" for grammatical correctness.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"穩定性的重要資料來源\" is semantically confusing, as \"資料來源\" refers to a source of data, not stability.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Misleading in meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *# 銀行業系統 — 資料來源主要的穩定因素*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"資料來源\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"穩定因素\" is not the same as \"source of stability.\" The structure is also awkward.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Misleading and unidiomatic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *銀行體系 — 主要的穩定資料來源*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"資料來源\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"穩定資料來源\" is semantically incorrect, as \"資料來源\" refers to data, not stability.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Misleading.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *# 銀行體系 — 主要的資料來源*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"資料來源\" and maintains the structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits \"stability,\" which is a critical part of the original meaning.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Incomplete and misleading.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best approach is to preserve the original structure and meaning while ensuring that the term \"Source\" is translated as \"資料來源\" and that the phrase \"a major source of stability\" is rendered in a natural and idiomatic way in Traditional Chinese. The phrase \"穩定的重要來源\" is the most natural and accurate, though it slightly reorders the original structure for fluency. This is acceptable in a heading, where clarity and brevity are prioritized over strict literal translation.\n\n儘管各譯文均大致準確地傳達了原文意思，並正確使用了詞典中指定的翻譯，但在語法、流暢度與語感方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**：語法正確，用詞準確，語感自然，是目前最接近理想翻譯的版本。但「這是由於雄厚的資本及流動性緩衝所支持」語序略顯生硬，可稍作調整。\n2. **第二譯文**：語句較長，結構複雜，「貫穿全年都維持穩健」語感稍顯不自然，且「雄厚且充足的資本」重複用詞，略顯累贅。\n3. **第三譯文**：語法正確，語感自然，但「在整一年維持穩健」語序略顯口語化，可調整為更正式的表達。\n4. **第四譯文**：「全年維持穩定」中「穩定」與詞典中「穩健」不一致，應使用「穩健」。此外，「支持強勁的資本」語序不當，應為「資本及流動性緩衝支持」。\n5. **第五譯文**：語法正確，語感自然，用詞準確，僅「得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝支持」語序略顯生硬，可稍作調整。\n6. **第六譯文**：語法正確，語感自然，用詞準確，僅「這得益於」語序略顯口語化，可調整為更正式的表達。\n**改進方向**：在保持語法正確與詞典準確性的前提下，應追求語句流暢、語感自然，避免重複與口語化表達。特別注意「穩定」與「穩健」的區別，以及「支持」的語序與搭配。\n**最佳翻譯**：\n儘管面對包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張局勢以及充滿挑戰的信貸環境在內的多重挑戰，香港的銀行體系全年維持穩健，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝支持。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本比率維持在21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率截至2023年第四季微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的100%。雖然分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%微升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍維持在長期歷史平均值2.0%以下。此增加主要由對內地私營企業（POE）房地產開發商的風險敞口推動；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信貸風險管理，此類風險敞口在更廣泛層面得到有效控制，銀行業整體資產品質仍保持健康。\n\n2023年最令市場參與者感到意外的，毫無疑問是美國銀行危機蔓延至歐洲，造成自2008年全球金融危機以來前所未有的系統性銀行壓力。香港金融管理局在情況發展過程中保持高度警覺，並採取一系列預防性措施，以限制對本地銀行和金融體系信心的潛在負面溢出影響。這一點，加上香港銀行維持的雄厚資本和流動性緩衝，意味著我們的銀行業基本上未受動盪影響，即使全球金融市場動盪，仍具韌性。在這起事件之後，香港金融管理局進行了一次全面的內部檢討，旨在為本地銀行業汲取經驗，並加強香港金融管理局的監管有效性與靈活性，以應對未來可能發生的銀行危機。\n\n雖然審慎的信貸風險管理至關重要，我們一直重申對銀行的監管預期，即銀行應留意支持實體經濟的需要。隨著新型冠狀病毒疫情的經濟影響減退，銀行業於2023年7月開始有秩序地退出預核准本金償還假期計劃，香港金融管理局與銀行緊密合作，確保貸款償還逐步且暢順過渡至正常狀態，並為持續面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年較早時候，鑒於部分中小企業即使在疫情結束後，仍面臨營運上的挑戰，香港金融管理局推出了九項新措施，進一步協助它們從銀行取得融資。\n\n在檢討與本地物業市場相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此項放寬使大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展及投資融資的貸款與價值比率上限上升。其後於2024年初暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n**審核與評估：**\n1. **第一譯文**：整體語句通順，用詞準確，符合傳統中文語法與表達習慣。唯一可改進之處在於「提高了對大多數住宅按揭貸款以及用於物業發展及投資的融資的貸款與價值比率上限」語句稍顯冗長，可稍作簡化。\n2. **第二譯文**：語句流暢，用詞準確，但「更進一步」一詞略顯多餘，與語境不完全契合。\n3. **第三譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，符合傳統中文語法與表達習慣，且語氣自然，為目前最佳譯文。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，但「跟隨其後」語意重複，與「其後」語義重複，應刪除。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句通順，但「自2009年推出以來」語序略顯不自然，應調整語序。\n6. **第六譯文**：語句通順，但「審視」與「相關因素」語意略顯模糊，與原文「reviewed」語意不完全契合。\n**改進與最佳譯文：**\n在檢討與本地物業市場相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此項放寬使大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展及投資融資的貸款與價值比率上限上升。其後於2024年初暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n香港金融管理局對金融機構的監管一直與時並進。近年來，全球詐騙情況急劇增加，我們已大幅加強對抗新型詐騙手法的措施，推出一套全面的措施，以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享；加強對可疑交易的監控（包括執行實時詐騙監控以及收緊支付卡認證）；授權客戶對其支付卡擁有更多控制權；以及透過推出《反詐騙消費者保護守則》及預交易警示機制，提高客戶及公眾對詐騙的意識，當識別到較高風險的快速支付系統（FPS）交易時，會向用戶發出警告。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的快速增長，香港金融管理局已與銀行業界合作，更廣泛地加強對消費者及投資者的保障，並提升銀行的營運及網絡韌性，以及對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦能力。同時，所有主要銀行已大幅加強應對及從具破壞性的勒索軟件攻擊中復甦的能力。香港金融管理局與業界亦推動了不同消費者數據基礎設施項目，例如「信貸數據智」試驗計劃，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推進跨邊界信貸參考倡議，以便利企業進行跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技與數位化在風險妥善管理的情況下，可帶來巨大的機會。藉較早成功促進Regtech採用的經驗，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局的支持下，於2023年8月發表新的《金融科技推廣路線圖》，以推動金融機構在五個重點範疇——財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術——進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構將繼續與相關行業緊密合作，以便香港金融業整體能緊貼並把握多變金融科技發展的優勢。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心 — 行動與創新的中心\n\n2023年，我們充分走出疫情陰霾。香港不僅恢復了商業活動，其作為世界領先國際金融中心之一的地位，更因全球投資者的回流及我們加強的全球網絡而進一步凸顯。在香港本地，我們把握香港金融管理局成立三十週年的機遇，主辦了一系列大型國際活動，並邀請全球金融與銀行界高層參與，以展現香港的活力，並發出清晰信息：香港作為國際金融中心，對尋求增長與創新之全球投資者及金融機構而言，仍然具有相關性與不可或缺的地位。尤其值得注意的是，11月舉行的全球金融領導人投資峰會重臨，吸引來自約160家全球金融機構的超過350位國際及地區領導人來港參與。在香港舉辦的其他高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議，以及兩場香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）合辦的會議，這些會議是當年規模最大的央行行長與銀行監督機構聚會之一。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n對外而言，2023年亦是香港積極加強與包括美國和歐洲在內的傳統市場，以及中東等新興目的地聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的同業監管機構及全球金融機構的高層管理人員會面，向他們介紹香港及內地的機會，同時力求為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n為配合這些聯繫努力，我們積極參與國際及區域組織的工作，並擔任若干領導角色。在本年度，我接受了擔任BIS主要新興市場經濟體總裁會議主席，以及擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組聯席主席的邀請。我的同事亦擔任巴塞爾委員會、金融行動特別工作小組，以及東亞及太平洋中央銀行高層會議等機構下屬的重要小組的主席或聯席主席。香港金融管理局在多間區域及國際組織中的領導地位，是對香港在推動全球貨幣及金融穩定的過程中所具備的專門知識和貢獻，以及香港作為國際金融中心重要性的認可。\n\n為建立上述成就，我們必須將自身定位為一家具前瞻性的國際金融中心，保持領先地位，以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來數年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢，即內地持續開放、綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將持續支持金融市場的發展，以把握這些長期趨勢所帶來的機會，同時定位我們的金融平台，提供領先服務，以吸引更多業務來香港。有關我們在綠色及可持續金融方面的工作詳情，讀者可參閱我們的《2023年可持續發展報告》。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce,

2023年重點摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍實現正面增長，這是由入境旅遊及內地需求復甦所推動。勞動市場隨着經濟復甦繼續改善，而通脹則保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和的步伐進一步復甦，儘管前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍實現正面增長，這是由入境旅遊及內地需求復甦所推動。勞動市場隨着經濟復甦繼續改善，而通脹則保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和的步伐進一步復甦，儘管前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年繼續保持健康，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。資產質量維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將「高企一段較長時間」的情況下，2023年港元大部分時間在可兌換範圍的疲弱一側進行交易，其中在2月中至5月初期間，疲弱一側的可兌換保證被觸發了8次。港元匯率及貨幣市場保持穩健，並繼續以暢順及有秩序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年是聯繫匯率制度實施40周年。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年間幫助香港抵禦一系列震盪和危機，展現了該制度的韌性與穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速應對三月美國及歐洲的銀行風暴，從管理其餘波至完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以供本地銀行業參考，同時維持其對銀行信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及第三方提供的技術服務使用不斷增加，香港金融管理局亦與銀行緊密合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局加強對支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂《銀行業行為守則》以及《反詐騙消費者保護憲章》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，建立針對虛擬資產相關活動的平衡監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，引入提升措施至「跨境財富管理互聯互通試點計劃」，並開始監管信託業務。亦推出名為「Credit Data Smart」的消費者信貸參考服務試驗計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資方面的努力展現了其承諾，以風險為本的方式應對最高威脅。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙，香港金融管理局已透過推出即時詐騙監測、提升銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享、加強公眾教育，以及在使用快速支付系統時推出新的交易前警報機制，加強生態系統合作。與此同時，監管科技能力亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃得到提升。\n\n香港金融管理局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及信息披露等要求，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推進其工作，以確保一個可信的解決機制，包括制定有關接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施的新解決標準，以及完成對吸收損失能力政策標準執行情況的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會及HKMA-BIS高層次會議的順利舉行，展現了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局緊密合作，深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場之間的互聯互通。這包括提升跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃、為債券通南向交易指定額外做市商、順利推出Swap Connect北向交易，以及推出港幣-人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做市商計劃，所有這些措施均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色與可持續金融以及企業現金管理中心等範疇，已取得顯著進展。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上都較準確地傳達了原文意思，但在語序、用詞及語感上略有差異。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**語序自然，用詞準確，如「現金管理中心」與「顯著進展」皆符合語境，語感流暢，是目前最接近理想譯文的版本。\n2. **第二譯文**將「企業現金管理中心」譯為「企業財務中心」，雖語意相近，但「財務中心」較籠統，未能完全反映「treasury centres」的專業含義。\n3. **第三譯文**語序與原文差異較大，將「已取得顯著進展」提前，使句子重心偏移，影響語感。\n4. **第四譯文**與第一譯文相似，僅語序稍有差異，整體語感良好。\n5. **第五譯文**語序與第一譯文相近，但將「可持續金融」譯為「可持續融資」，語意略有偏差，且「企業財務中心」與原文語境不完全契合。\n6. **第六譯文**將「企業現金管理中心」譯為「企業資金庫中心」，用詞不夠專業，且語序較為混亂。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保專業術語如「corporate treasury centres」準確對應為「企業現金管理中心」。\n- 保持語序與原文一致，使句子結構清晰、語感自然。\n- 使用「已取得顯著進展」作為句子結尾，強調成果，符合中文表達習慣。\n**最終譯文：**\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色與可持續金融以及企業現金管理中心等範疇，已取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇取得重大進展。項目 mBridge 進入最小可行產品發展階段，電子港幣試點計劃第一階段已完成，商業數據交換見使用率增加，並順利與政府資料來源對接。此外，亦宣布了一項新的金融科技推廣路線圖，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術於銀行業內。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五周年，持續見到應用拓展及功能提升，包括與泰國 PromptPay 對接以實現跨境 QR 支付的新功能。在制定穩定幣發行者監管制度方面亦取得重大進展，並已發布諮詢文件以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 儲備管理\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe term \"Reserves Management\" is a technical term commonly used in finance and banking. The junior translators have provided several translations, with the most accurate being \"儲備管理\" and \"備付金管理.\" However, \"備付金管理\" is more specific to \"compensatory reserves\" or \"reserve requirements\" in banking contexts, while \"儲備管理\" is a more general and appropriate translation for \"Reserves Management\" in a broader financial context. Given that the original text is simply \"# Reserves Management\" without additional context, \"儲備管理\" is the most suitable and widely applicable translation. It is concise, accurate, and aligns with standard financial terminology in Traditional Chinese.\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，香港儲備基金仍成功取得2,260億港元的良好投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其在資產多元化及負責任投資方面的努力。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，錄得年化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the task is to translate it into Traditional Chinese. The dictionary is empty, so there are no specific terms that must be translated using predefined alternatives. However, the junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are close in meaning but differ slightly in wording and formatting.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately translates \"Corporate Functions\" as \"企業功能,\" which is a direct and commonly used translation. The use of the hashtag (#) matches the original formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. The translation is concise and appropriate.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: 企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"職能\" is a slightly more formal and nuanced term than \"功能,\" which can mean \"function\" or \"role.\" This may be more appropriate in a corporate or official context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is missing, which may be important for consistency with the original text.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 公司職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"公司\" (company) instead of \"企業\" (corporate), which is also acceptable. \"職能\" is a more formal term, as noted above.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"公司\" is slightly less formal than \"企業,\" which may not be ideal for a heading that is likely to be used in a corporate or professional context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first translation, which is accurate and well-formatted.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: #企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"職能\" and includes the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing between the hashtag and the text is inconsistent with the other translations, which may affect readability.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate translation without unnecessary formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is missing, which may be important for consistency with the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and consistent with the original formatting. \"企業功能\" is the most direct and commonly used translation for \"Corporate Functions\" in a business context. It is also used by the first and fourth junior translators, who included the hashtag, which matches the original text's formatting. The use of \"功能\" is appropriate for \"Functions\" in this context, as it conveys the idea of operational or organizational functions. While \"職能\" is a more formal and nuanced term, it may be overkill for a heading that is likely to be used in a corporate or professional context. Therefore, the best translation is \"# 企業功能.\"\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道與社區及市場保持積極聯繫，以推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n在內部，香港金融管理局致力於建立一支靈活應變且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升數字化能力，以適應變化，確保其政策和措施的有效執行。\n以下是對各份翻譯的評審與分析：\n1. **第一份翻譯**：用詞較為直譯，如「workforce」翻譯為「workforce」未翻譯，應為「員工隊伍」或「人力資源隊伍」。此外，「數位能力」在中文中較常用「數字化能力」或「數碼能力」，但語境中「數字化」更貼切。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，如「人力資源隊伍」、「數碼能力」、「有效執行」等，符合語境與語法。但「倡議」一詞在原文中為「initiatives」，翻譯為「措施」更貼切。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「團隊」、「適應變遷」、「政策和倡議」等。但「倡議」一詞仍可優化為「措施」或「政策」。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：語句完整，用詞準確，如「員工隊伍」、「財政紀律」、「數字化能力」、「政策和倡議」等。但「倡議」一詞仍可優化為「措施」。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：為英文原文，未進行翻譯，不符合要求。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，如「員工隊伍」、「財務紀律」、「數字化能力」、「政策和措施」等。此版本最接近最佳翻譯，僅需微調語序與用詞。\n**最佳翻譯考量**：在語句流暢度、用詞準確度與語境貼合度方面，第六份翻譯表現最佳。因此，最終翻譯在第六份基礎上進行微調，確保語句自然、用詞準確，並符合傳統中文語法與文化習慣。"}

三月22日至23日\n\n香港金融管理局主辦巴塞爾銀行監督委員會為期兩天的會議。這是自2020年疫情爆發以來，該委員會首次在巴塞爾總部以外舉行的實體會議，目標是討論最新銀行監管及監督政策，以協助維持全球金融穩定。\n\n# 3月24日\n\n香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）聯合在香港舉辦題為「未來導向的銀行監管：創新銀行業世界」的會議。\n\n本次會議標誌著香港在解除所有社交距離措施以及重新連繫香港與內地邊界後，首次舉辦針對國際金融監管社群的大型會議，吸引來自超過25個經濟體的中央銀行及監管機構逾100名高層官員，以及金融機構的高層主管參與。\n**審閱與分析：**\n1. **第一譯者**的翻譯整體語意清晰，語法正確，用詞自然，符合傳統中文的表達習慣。特別是「吸引來自超過25個經濟體的中央銀行及監管機構逾100名高層官員，以及金融機構的高層主管參與」這句，語序合理，語氣正式，符合新聞報導的語境。唯一可優化之處是「首次舉辦針對國際金融監管社群的大型會議」中「針對」一詞略顯生硬，可考慮使用「面向」或「為」來提升語感。\n2. **第二譯者**的翻譯在語法上存在問題，如「首次大量規模的國際金融監管社區會議」語序混亂，「大量規模」不符合中文表達習慣，應為「大型」或「規模龐大」。此外，「社區」一詞在這裡不恰當，應使用「社群」或「界別」。\n3. **第三譯者**的翻譯語意較為清晰，但「首次的大量國際金融監管社群大型會議」語序混亂，「大量」與「大型」重複，應刪除「大量」，保留「大型」。此外，「一百多位」與「逾100名」語意重複，可選其一。\n4. **第四譯者**的翻譯中出現了英文單字「executives」，未正確翻譯為「高層主管」，這是明顯的錯誤。此外，「大量規模」語序不當，應為「規模龐大」或「大型」。\n5. **第五譯者**的翻譯語意清晰，語法正確，但「頂級行政人員」與「高層主管」語意重複，可統一為「高層主管」。此外，「兩地邊境」雖正確，但「香港與內地邊界」更符合原文語境。\n6. **第六譯者**的翻譯整體語意清晰，語法正確，但「25多個經濟體」語序不當，應為「超過25個經濟體」。此外，「規模龐大的國際金融監管界會議」語意正確，但可考慮使用「大型」以更符合原文語境。\n**改進建議：**\n- 確保所有字詞符合傳統中文語法與語境，避免語序混亂或重複。\n- 使用「大型」而非「大量規模」，以符合原文語境。\n- 確保所有英文術語正確翻譯，如「executives」應為「高層主管」。\n- 統一用詞，如「高層官員」與「高層主管」應根據語境選擇最合適的詞語。\n- 使用「逾100名」或「100多名」，避免重複。\n**最終翻譯：**\n本次會議標誌著香港在解除所有社交距離措施以及重新連繫香港與內地邊界後，首次舉辦針對國際金融監管社群的大型會議，吸引來自超過25個經濟體的中央銀行及監管機構逾100名高層官員，以及金融機構的高層主管參與。\n\n# 4月21日\n\n香港金融管理局舉辦一場高層次分享環節，由香港金融管理局、香港警務處（HKPF）及零售銀行的高級代表參加，並宣布五項反詐騙舉措。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出一項監管科技（Suptech）試點計劃，針對「中間人賬戶網絡」分析，利用多間銀行的數據，從系統層面識別和緩解中間人賬戶網絡的風險，從而在反洗錢（AML）工作中取得更好成果。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation Quality and Fluency:**\n   - The first junior translator's translation is fluent and accurate, but uses the term \"洗錢帳戶網絡\" (money laundering account network), which may not fully capture the nuance of \"mule account network.\"\n   - The second junior translator uses \"駱駝帳戶網絡\" (camel account network), which is a mistranslation of \"mule account network.\" \"駱駝\" (camel) is unrelated to the intended meaning.\n   - The third junior translator uses \"中間人賬戶網絡\" (intermediary account network), which is a more accurate and natural translation of \"mule account network\" in the context of financial crime.\n   - The fourth junior translator uses \"貨幣 mules 網絡\" (currency mules network), which is awkward and mixes English with Chinese, reducing clarity.\n   - The fifth junior translator uses \"偽裝賬戶網絡\" (disguised account network), which is not an accurate translation of \"mule account network.\"\n   - The sixth junior translator uses \"人頭帳戶網絡\" (front account network), which is close but slightly less precise than \"中間人賬戶網絡.\"\n2. **Grammar and Vocabulary:**\n   - Most translations are grammatically sound, but some use awkward phrasing, such as \"貨幣 mules 網絡\" or \"偽裝賬戶網絡.\"\n   - The term \"mule account network\" should be translated as \"中間人賬戶網絡\" to reflect the role of these accounts in facilitating financial crimes.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:**\n   - The term \"Suptech\" is best translated as \"監管科技\" (regulatory technology), which is widely understood in the financial sector.\n   - The term \"better outcomes\" is well translated as \"更好成果\" or \"更好成效\" in most translations.\n4. **Dictionary Compliance:**\n   - All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"識別\" (identify), \"工作\" (work), \"更好\" (better), \"亦\" (also), \"推出\" (launches), and \"網絡\" (networks).\n**Improved Translation:**\n香港金融管理局亦推出一項監管科技（Suptech）試點計劃，針對「中間人賬戶網絡」分析，利用多間銀行的數據，從系統層面識別和緩解中間人賬戶網絡的風險，從而在反洗錢（AML）工作中取得更好成果。\n\n# 4月28日\n\n香港按揭貸款保證有限公司（HKMCI）為香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）全資附屬公司，現宣布推出專為跨境客運貿易設計的「100%貸款擔保計劃」（DLGS）及旅遊業的「100%貸款擔保計劃」（DLGS）。\n\n# 4月28日\n\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）合作舉辦首輪座談會，邀請銀行界及虛擬資產（VA）界別參與，推動有關銀行服務支持香港虛擬資產行業發展的交流。  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, using the correct dictionary terms: \"推動\" for \"promote\" and \"行業\" for \"sectors.\" The structure is natural, and the meaning is clearly conveyed. However, \"首輪座談會\" could be more precise as \"首輪圓桌會議\" to match the original \"roundtable.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"推動\" and \"行業\" correctly. The phrase \"以推動銀行服務在支持香港虛擬資產行業發展方面的交流\" is slightly wordy but still clear. The term \"首輪座談會\" is used, which is acceptable but not as precise as \"圓桌會議.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is well-structured and natural. It uses \"推動\" and \"行業\" correctly. However, \"首個圓桌會議\" is slightly off compared to \"first roundtable,\" which is better rendered as \"首輪圓桌會議.\" Also, \"支持香港虛擬資產行業的發展\" is slightly misplaced in the sentence structure.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is accurate and fluent. It uses \"推動\" and \"行業\" correctly. However, the phrase \"就香港虛擬資產行業發展所支持的銀行服務進行交流\" is awkward and changes the original meaning slightly, making it less direct.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is fluent and accurate. It uses \"推動\" and \"行業\" correctly. However, \"以推動交流，支持香港虛擬資產行業的發展\" is slightly vague and less precise than the original structure.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is accurate and natural. It uses \"推動\" and \"行業\" correctly. However, \"支持虛擬資產行業在香港的發展\" slightly changes the original meaning by placing the location of the development at the end, which is less direct.\n**Improved Translation:**\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）合作舉辦首輪圓桌會議，邀請銀行界及虛擬資產（VA）界別參與，推動有關銀行服務支持香港虛擬資產行業發展的交流。\n\n# 5月2日\n\n強制參考查核計劃第一階段已推出，以應對銀行業中「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。\n\n# 5月9日\n\n香港金融管理局發表一份名為《反洗錢監管科技：網絡分析》的報告，推動網絡分析能力的應用，以加強銀行反洗錢系統對詐騙及其他金融犯罪的應對。\n\n# 5月25日\n\n香港金融管理局於政府憲報發表修訂的《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資指引》（AML\/CFT 指引），以回應近期對《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資條例》的立法修訂。\n\n# 6月1日\n\n監督經授權機構的信託業務在新制度下開始。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯的譯文時，我們需從語法、流暢度、用詞準確性與文化適切性幾個方面進行分析。\n1. **第一譯文**：「監督經授權機構的憑託業務在新制度項下開始。」  \n   - **優點**：語法正確，結構清晰，使用「憑託業務」符合「trust business」的字面翻譯。\n   - **缺點**：「憑託」在現代金融語境中較少使用，「信託」更為常見且專業。\n2. **第二譯文**：「新制度下對授權機構信託業務的監督開始了。」  \n   - **優點**：語序自然，使用「信託業務」符合專業術語，語氣較為口語化，符合中文表達習慣。\n   - **缺點**：「開始了」雖正確，但略顯鬆散，與原文「commences」的正式語氣稍有差距。\n3. **第三譯文**：「新制度下對經授權機構信託業務的監督開始。」  \n   - **優點**：語法正確，用詞專業，語氣正式。\n   - **缺點**：「經授權」雖正確，但「授權」更為簡潔。\n4. **第四譯文**：「新制度下，對認可機構信託業務的監管開始。」  \n   - **優點**：語序自然，使用「監管」一詞更符合現代金融監管語境。\n   - **缺點**：「認可機構」與原文「authorized institutions」不完全對應，可能引起歧義。\n5. **第五譯文**：「新制度下，授權機構的信託業務監管開始。」  \n   - **優點**：語法正確，用詞專業，語氣正式。\n   - **缺點**：語序略顯生硬，「信託業務監管」雖正確，但「監督」更貼近「supervision」的語義。\n6. **第六譯文**：「在新制度下，受權機構的信託業務監督開始實施。」  \n   - **優點**：語序自然，用詞專業。\n   - **缺點**：「開始實施」與原文「commences」語義不完全一致，且「受權機構」與「authorized institutions」不完全對應。\n**總結與改進方向：**  \n最佳譯文應在語法正確、語氣正式、用詞專業與語序自然之間取得平衡。根據詞典要求，「commences」應翻譯為「開始」，而「authorized institutions」應翻譯為「授權機構」或「經授權機構」。結合上述分析，最佳譯文應使用「信託業務」、「監督」、「授權機構」與「開始」，並確保語序自然、語氣正式。\n因此，最佳譯文為：  \n**監督經授權機構的信託業務在新制度下開始。**\n\n# 7月6日\n\n香港金融管理局與數碼港共同主辦第四屆反洗錢合規科技實驗室（AMLab 4），邀請零售銀行、儲值支付工具（SVF）持牌機構、科技公司及業界專家，共同創新發展一套涵蓋整個行業的即時詐騙監測方法，並協助提醒潛在的詐騙受害者。隨後舉行的 Regtech Connect 環節中，科技公司會與參與的銀行及 SVF 持牌機構展示相關的 Regtech 工具與解決方案。\n\n# 20 六月\n\n香港金融管理局鑑於客戶支付卡使用模式的改變，以及相關未經授權交易涉及詐騙活動的上升，引入一套共33項的全面措施，以提升對支付卡客戶的保護。\n\n# 20 六月\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）、香港銀行公會（HKAB）及警務處宣布推出銀行間訊息交換平台（FINEST），這是一個銀行對銀行的資訊分享平台，有助於增加銀行分享企業賬戶資訊的能力，以更有效地偵測及打擊詐騙及傀儡賬戶網絡。\n\n# 6月23日\n\n香港信貸管理學院（HKMCI）宣布，根據SFGS的主要緩刑安排，申請期間已延長三個月。\n\n# 6月26日\n\n香港金融管理局推出公眾諮詢，就檢討三層銀行體系提出建議，建議將三層銀行體系簡化為兩層。\n\n# 6月29日\n\n香港金融管理局與香港銀行公會共同推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》，以提升公眾對保護信用卡及個人資料的意識，並獲得警務處及消費者委員會的全面支持。香港所有23間發行信用卡的銀行，以及來自不同行業的15間商戶機構均參與此公約。\n\n# 7月7日\n\n香港金融管理局向銀行發出指引，調整物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。主要調整包括：對價值15百萬港元或以下的自住住宅物業，將最高貸款與價值比率增加至70%；對價值超過15百萬港元但不超過30百萬港元的自住住宅物業，將比率調整為60%；對非住宅物業，則將比率調整為60%。至於以按揭申請人淨資產為基礎評估的按揭貸款，其最高貸款與價值比率則向上調整至50%。\n\n# 7月7日\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司宣布對已完成住宅物業的按保計劃（MIP）作出修訂，以及就按揭保險費用的新安排，以便為有住房需求的購房者提供協助。\n### Review and Reasoning:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using the correct dictionary terms: \"MIP\" as \"按保計劃\", \"completed\" as \"已完成\", \"needs\" as \"需求\", \"made\" as \"作出\", \"respect\" as \"就\", and \"order\" as \"以便\". The structure is natural and the sentence flows well in Traditional Chinese.\n2. **Translation 2** is also accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, \"提供協助予\" is slightly less common than \"提供協助給\" or \"提供協助予\" is acceptable but \"提供協助給\" is more natural in this context. The term \"房屋需求\" is slightly broader than \"住房需求\", which may not be the best fit.\n3. **Translation 3** incorrectly uses \"取得\" for \"made\", which is not appropriate in this context. \"取得\" implies \"obtained\" or \"acquired\", whereas \"made\" in this context refers to \"amendments\" or \"revisions\", so \"作出\" is more suitable. The rest of the translation is otherwise accurate.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"按保計劃\" correctly for \"MIP\", but repeats it unnecessarily. Also, \"買家\" is less formal than \"購房者\" or \"買樓人士\", which are more commonly used in official announcements.\n5. **Translation 5** correctly uses \"HKMCI\" as \"香港測量師學會\" and \"MIP\" as \"按保計劃\". However, \"進行修訂\" is slightly more passive than \"作出修訂\", and \"買樓人士\" is acceptable but \"購房者\" is more standard in this context.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"按揭保險局\" instead of \"按揭證券有限公司\", which is incorrect. The correct entity is \"香港按揭證券有限公司\", not \"按揭保險局\".\n### Best Translation:\nBased on the above review, the best translation is a refined version of **Translation 1**, with minor adjustments for clarity and naturalness. It uses the correct dictionary terms, maintains a formal and professional tone, and ensures the sentence flows naturally in Traditional Chinese.\n\n# 7月11日\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制宣布，預核准本金支付假期計劃（PPPHS）將於2023年7月底屆滿後，開始有序退出。PPPHS下的部分本金償還選項將進一步提升，以協助企業逐步回歸正常償還。\n\n# 7月13日\n\n香港存款保障局推出為期三個月的公眾諮詢，就存款保障計劃的建議提升進行徵詢。\n\n# 7月28日\n\n香港金融管理局推出「綠色及可持續金融」（GSF）新模組的核心層，該模組屬於「提升銀行業從業人員專業能力架構」的一部分。該模組旨在便利銀行業從業人員獲取GSF知識，並更有效發展與GSF相關範疇的專業能力。\n\n# 7月28日\n\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合發佈通告，向中介機構說明在與高端專業投資者進行交易時，簡化履行適當性義務的方法。\n\n# 8月17日\n\n香港金融管理局與會計及財務報告局簽訂新的備忘錄（MoU），同意通過案例轉介、相互協助、能力建設和資訊交換來加強合作。\n\n# 8月25日\n\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會及保險業監理局（IA）合作，發表新的金融科技推廣路線圖，概述關鍵措施，以進一步推動金融科技在金融服務業的應用。\n\n# 9月4日\n\n香港機電創新中心推出「電動的士DLGS」，以鼓勵的士業主將其液化石油氣、汽油或混合動力的士更換為電動的士。\n\n# 九月二十一日\n\n為提升銀行業對氣候風險的韌性，香港金融管理局推出「綠色金融科技競賽」，以推動香港銀行業應用綠色金融科技解決方案。\n\n# 9月22日\n\n香港測量師學會宣布，已對正在興建的住宅物業的按保計劃作出修訂，使適用的合資格準則與已完成住宅物業的準則一致。\n\n# 9月25日\n\n香港金融管理局發表一份名為《反洗錢\/反恐融資監管科技：案例研究與見解 第二輯》的報告，涵蓋高端的反洗錢監管科技解決方案，並分享銀行在應用監管科技於其反洗錢流程不同階段的視野。\n\n# 九月二十九日\n\n香港金融管理局推出兩組額外空間數據集，透過開放應用程式介面，為公眾提供香港20間零售銀行實體分行及自動櫃員機的資料。\n香港金融管理局推出兩組額外空間數據集，透過開放應用程式介面，為公眾提供香港20間零售銀行實體分行及自動櫃員機的資料。\n\n# 10月20日\n\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆更新有關中介機構虛擬資產活動的聯合通告，以擴大零售用戶對虛擬資產交易、諮詢及資產管理服務的接觸機會。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, using the correct dictionary terms: \"update\" is translated as \"更新\", \"circular\" as \"通告\", and \"expand\" as \"擴大\". The term \"dealing\" is translated as \"交易\", which is appropriate. The phrase \"零售用戶對...的接觸機會\" is natural and conveys the intended meaning well.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses \"介紹\" for \"update\", which is incorrect. \"Update\" should be \"更新\", not \"介紹\". The structure is otherwise clear, but the misuse of the dictionary term is a significant flaw.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** uses \"介紹\" for \"update\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"渠道\" for \"access\", which is less precise than \"接觸機會\" or \"接觸\".

Also, “啟動試點計劃” is slightly awkward compared to “推出試點計劃.”\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses “推出” for “launched,” which is correct.  \n   - Weaknesses: Uses “信用評分機構” instead of “信用參考機構,” which is not an exact match for the dictionary term. Also, retains the English name “Credit Data Smart” instead of translating it.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses “多個” and “正式” correctly. The term “信貸數據智” is a more natural-sounding translation of “Credit Data Smart” than the direct transliteration.  \n   - Weaknesses: “信貸數據智” may be slightly ambiguous, as “信貸” typically refers to “loans” or “credit,” which may not fully capture the meaning of “Credit Data Smart.”\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses “多個” and “正式.” Uses “推出” for “launched.”  \n   - Weaknesses: Retains the English name “Credit Data Smart” instead of translating it, which is not ideal for a formal document.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses “多個” and “正式” correctly. The term “信用資料智慧” is a more natural and meaningful translation of “Credit Data Smart.”  \n   - Weaknesses: “資料” is slightly less precise than “數據” in this context, though it is still acceptable.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses “多個” and “正式” correctly.  \n   - Weaknesses: “信用數據智庫” is a misinterpretation of “Credit Data Smart.” “智庫” means “think tank” or “knowledge base,” which is not appropriate here.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, provide a natural and meaningful translation of “Credit Data Smart,” and ensure fluency and clarity. “信用數據智” is a concise and natural-sounding translation of “Credit Data Smart,” and “推出” is the correct term for “launched.” The structure “其試點計劃已推出” is also more fluent and natural than “並已啟動試點計劃.” Therefore, the first junior translator’s version is the closest, but with minor adjustments to enhance clarity and naturalness.\n\n# 11月22日\n\n香港金融管理局每年為銀行及SVF行業舉辦反洗錢研討會，內容包括《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資條例》的修訂、反洗錢／反恐融資指引，以及有關交易監控系統主題審視的意見反饋。\n\n# 11月24日\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與銀行公會（HKAB）及銀行界共同支持警務處推出反詐騙聯盟，以加強反洗錢生態系統偵測、阻斷及預防詐騙的能力。\n\n# 11月29日\n\n香港金融管理局發出通告，說明綠色及可持續投資產品銷售與分銷的預期標準及良好實踐範例。\n\n# 12月4日\n\n貨幣當局、保監局及證監會簽訂備忘錄，設立一個框架，以加強和支持解決機構之間的有效合作與協調。\n\n# 12月7日\n\n在港銀聯及香港銀行公會與The DTC協會的支持下，推出修訂版的銀行業實務守則，以提升數碼銀行服務中客戶的保障。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"support\" → \"支持\", \"launch\" → \"推出\", \"revised\" → \"修訂\", \"enhance\" → \"提升\".\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"港銀聯\" is not a standard term and may confuse readers. \"The DTC Association\" is translated as \"The DTC協會\", which is not fully localized. \"數碼銀行服務中客戶的保障\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Accurately uses dictionary terms and provides full names for organizations (e.g., \"香港金融管理局（HKMA）\").\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"操守準則\" is a more formal term than \"實務守則\", which may not match the original \"Code of Banking Practice\". \"數碼銀行服務中的保障\" is slightly less natural than \"數碼銀行服務中客戶的保障\".\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"修訂並推出\" which is grammatically correct.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Omits \"The DTC Association\" and incorrectly uses \"港銀聯\" instead of \"HKMA\".

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules

2024年工作重點及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和的步伐繼續復甦，得益於入境旅遊的持續復甦、公共基礎設施項目以及穩健的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不明朗因素，特別是與未來美國政策利率路徑、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張相關的因素。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性以及多年來積累的充足緩衝，繼續具備抵禦不利震盪的能力。\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將在面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境時保持警覺，力求及時識別新興風險，並以靈活應變的方式應對。同時，我們將尋求機會，創造政策空間，以協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在這個充滿挑戰的投資環境中管理外匯基金時，我們將繼續謹慎投資，同時保持靈活，根據適當情況採取防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與健全性\n\n全球經濟近年的不明朗因素預料將在2024年持續。香港金融管理局將緊貼最新發展，謹慎應對潛在風險，目標在於維持金融系統的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n全球經濟近年的不明朗因素預料將在2024年持續。香港金融管理局將緊貼最新發展，謹慎應對潛在風險，目標在於維持金融系統的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警覺以防範潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的不確定性、不斷演變的地緣政治風險，以及全球經濟復甦不均等因素而出現波動。2024年亦是關鍵的選舉年，多項主要選舉將於世界各地舉行，這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年來累積的緩衝能力，已具備抵禦不利衝擊的優勢。香港金融管理局亦具備足夠的能力、資源及承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續其努力，緊密監察本地及外部環境中出現的任何風險及漏洞，並在必要時部署適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，探討影響香港經濟的問題，評估並應對與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行業穩定性\n\n2023年，全球各地出現新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而其他爭端亦維持未解決狀態，導致政治不確定性與不穩定性，情況預期將持續至2024年。高利率作為經濟壓力的表現形式，是全球經濟環境的特徵，而利率在進入2024年時仍維持高水準。在銀行業方面，持續推動數位化及執行新技術，包括人工智慧，雖然帶來許多優勢，但也同時帶來新的營運及網路安全風險，以及監管上的挑戰。在如此動盪的政治、經濟及科技環境中，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行具備抵禦震盪的能力。同時，我們亦會繼續提升及優化銀行監管及監督架構與政策，並考慮科技發展、客戶預期的改變，以及國際標準與最高實務。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於所有翻譯均大致準確地使用了詞彙表中的對應詞彙，並在語意傳達上表現良好，但各有細節上的差異與可改進之處。以下為具體評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯者**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，特別是「貫穿經濟週期」的處理較為自然，但「取得適當平衡」語序略顯生硬。\n2. **第二譯者**：語意完整，但「提備」一詞在金融語境中較少使用，應使用「撥備」；「貫穿整個經濟週期」語序略顯冗長。\n3. **第三譯者**：語句通順，但「跟隨銀行落實」語意與原文「follow up with banks」不完全一致，應為「跟進銀行」。\n4. **第四譯者**：整體最佳，語意準確，語序自然，用詞符合金融專業語境，僅「跟進」一詞可再斟酌。\n5. **第五譯者**：語意完整，但「貫穿經濟週期」語序略顯生硬，且「跟隨銀行落實」語意與原文不完全一致。\n6. **第六譯者**：「持牌金融機構」與「AIs」不完全對應，應使用「授權機構（AIs）」；「信貸風險管理及監控」語意重複，應為「信貸風險管理與控制」。\n**改進方向**：應確保「AIs」正確翻譯為「授權機構（AIs）」，避免使用「持牌金融機構」；「撥備」比「提備」更符合金融專業語境；「跟進」比「跟隨」更符合「follow up with」的語意；「貫穿經濟週期」語序可調整為「貫穿經濟週期」以更自然。\n---\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將特別關注監測授權機構（AIs）的資產質量，並評估其信貸風險管理與控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類與撥備實務及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業行業保持緊密對話，以確保AIs在經濟週期內在進行審慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進銀行在2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不明朗因素以及地緣政治緊張可能增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金融管理局將把保持警惕作為優先事項，並會繼續更有效地監管獲授權機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 跟進行動：從2023年銀行風暴中汲取的經驗\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將推行其在回應2023年美國及歐洲銀行動盪時所進行的內部審查中所識別的跟進行動。這些行動將進一步加強監管有效性，並提升其在銀行危機出現時處理危機的能力。這些行動包括在HKMA的監管審查過程中加強對持牌機構（AIs）銀行賬簿中利率風險的風險捕捉，改善持牌機構（AIs）在銀行服務持續數字化背景下處理流動性壓力的準備情況，簡化HKMA的危機管理程序，以及進一步加強跨機構及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n審查與分析：\n所有翻譯版本都正確地將 \"Operational and technology risk\" 翻譯為「營運及科技風險」或「操作與科技風險」，其中「營運」與「操作」在語意上略有差異，但都可接受。根據語境與常見用法，「營運」更常用於企業或組織的運作風險，而「操作」則偏向於具體的操作流程風險。因此，「營運及科技風險」在語境上更為自然。\n此外，第五與第六位翻譯者在標題前加上了「#」符號，與原文格式一致，但若此為正式文件或報告，建議不加「#」符號以保持專業性。\n最佳翻譯為：營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續監察銀行機構（AIs）在達成全面遵守HKMA監管政策手冊（SPM）「營運韌性」模組OR-2方面的進展，並評估及比較銀行對合理中斷的容忍限額，以提升銀行體系的整體韌性。在有關網絡風險方面，我們將監察銀行機構根據網絡韌性評估框架2.0進行新的一輪自我評估，並監察銀行機構落實安全的第三層數據備份，以提升其在面對具破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑑於各譯文在語法、用詞及語境適應性方面各有得失，以下為綜合評估與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**整體語意清晰，用詞準確，如「密切關注」、「靈活應變及具預見性的機制」等表達自然，惟「生成式人工智能」與「分布式账本」的搭配略顯生硬，可更貼合語境。\n2. **第二譯文**語句流暢，「數碼化」與「數碼詐欺」的用詞較為現代化，惟「對抗」一詞與「機制」搭配稍顯不協調，建議改為「應對」或「對抗」視語境而定。\n3. **第三譯文**語意完整，惟「emerging 風險」未翻譯，應為「新興風險」，且「數位化」與「數位詐騙」的用詞與原文語境略有出入，建議統一為「數字化」與「數字詐騙」。\n4. **第四譯文**存在明顯錯誤，如「以櫃台持續增長的數位詐騙趨勢」中「櫃台」誤用，應為「應對」或「對抗」，且語句結構混亂，影響理解。\n5. **第五譯文**語意準確，用詞自然，如「數字化轉型」、「網絡詐騙」等表達貼合語境，惟「建立」與「運作」語意略有差異，建議根據原文語境選擇。\n6. **第六譯文**語意完整，惟「利益相關方」與「以櫃台」的用詞與語境不協調，應調整為「相關持份者」與「應對」。\n**改進建議**：應統一使用「數字化」與「數字詐騙」，避免混用「數碼化」與「數位化」；「機制」應搭配「應對」或「對抗」，避免語意混亂；「櫃台」為明顯誤譯，應修正為「應對」；「生成式人工智能」與「分布式分類帳」的搭配應更自然。\n**最佳翻譯如下**：\n鑑於銀行業務數字化步伐持續加快，香港金融管理局將保持緊密關注因使用先進科技，如生成式人工智能和分布式分類帳所產生的新興風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，運作一個靈活應變及預防性的機制，以應對數字詐騙持續增長的趨勢。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資\n\n2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局將針對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持有效、風險為本地落實對政治敏感人物要求的修改，並支持穩定幣發行機構監管制度的執行。我們亦將發行指引，協助人工智能優化其交易監控系統，並推動人工智慧的負責任使用，並透過主題工作重點應對高階洗錢的控制措施。為加強生態系統對數字詐騙的應對並減低受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾和業界，就擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍的建議進行討論，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶，並基於收到的反饋推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過跨多間銀行匯集與反洗錢相關的數據，全面建置Macro Analytics 3.0，並與現有的生態系統詐騙分析接介。這將帶來更迅速的跨銀行回應，並進一步提升我們數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，讓我們能對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險採取更迅速、更果斷的行動。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局將加強對持牌機構在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的現場檢查及非現場監察。具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境財富管理通聯（跨境WMC）業務、數字化分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，鑑於最新市場發展以及國際標準的演變。\n\n香港金融管理局將與其他監管機構及銀行業界進行緊密溝通，並在適當的時候就投資、保險及強積金產品銷售方面的監管標準提供指引。尤其為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保現行針對虛擬資產行業的監管制度穩健、全面及平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將便利並監察業界執行跨境WMC的提升措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局合作，以便進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並在適當情況下整合及澄清指引，以便利業界合規。此外，除信託業務外，我們亦將於2024年10月2日開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監督由證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供保管服務的機構所從事的新類型13受規管活動。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n在所有提供的翻譯中，大部分都正確地將 \"Oversight\" 翻譯為 \"監督\" 或 \"監管\"，這兩個詞在語義上非常接近，都表示對某事進行監視和管理。然而，\"監管\" 更常用於正式或法律語境中，特別是在金融領域，因此在這裡使用 \"監管\" 更為恰當。\n此外，所有翻譯都正確地將 \"financial market infrastructures\" 翻譯為 \"金融市場基礎設施\"，這是一個準確且自然的翻譯。\n因此，最佳的翻譯應該是 \"金融市場基礎設施的監管\"，因為它既準確又符合金融領域的常用語。\n\n香港金融管理局旨在根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的不同指引，推動其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全及效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI的執行監測及評估工作，並參與其他國際工作小組，商討與金融市場基礎設施相關的新穎及創新倡議的執行情況。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適時檢討及加強監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務以及市場和科技的發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n# 政策制定\n政策制定\n# 政策制定\n# 政策制定\n政策制定\n所有翻譯都正確地將 \"Policy development\" 翻譯為 \"政策制定\"，這是一個準確且自然的中文表達。然而，注意到有些翻譯在 \"政策制定\" 前加上了 \"#\" 號，這在中文中通常用於標題或標籤，而非正文內容。因此，最自然的翻譯應當是 \"政策制定\"，不帶任何標點符號。\n基於以上分析，最佳翻譯為：\n政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續加強及完善其銀行監管及監督框架和政策，鑑於國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n擬議修訂《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR），以實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package），預計在立法會通過修訂後，於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，香港金融管理局將繼續準備支持規則應用所需的指引、銀行報表及標準披露格式和表格。尤其，我們計劃：\n- 於2024年第2季就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆週期資本緩衝（CCyB）－私人部門信貸風險的地理分配」及報表MA(BS)25「逆週期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂進行業界諮詢，反映最終改革方案的實施及國際銀行統計報表修訂所帶來的後續變更；以及\n- 完成有關落實新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準僅需報告要求的套件，該要求將於2024年7月1日開始實施。\n\n那些與修訂後的銀行業規例（BCR）下最終套件的執行所產生後果有關的《銀行（風險敞口限額）規則》（BELR）及《銀行（流動性）規則》（BLR）的擬議修訂部分，亦預計於2025年1月1日生效。香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃於2024年完成相關監管回報的擬議後續修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發佈了關於銀行加密資產風險敞口審慎管理的新標準，以及針對該標準的後續針對性修訂。本地將於2025年執行該標準。香港金融管理局將審視對包括銀行資本規則（BCR）、銀行債務規則（BDR）、銀行流動性風險規則（BELR）及銀行流動性規則（BLR）在內的不同規則組別進行潛在立法修訂的需要，並於2025年上半年進行有關必要規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發佈了關於銀行加密資產風險敞口審慎管理的新標準，以及針對該標準的後續針對性修訂。本地將於2025年執行該標準。香港金融管理局將審視對包括銀行資本規則（BCR）、銀行債務規則（BDR）、銀行流動性風險規則（BELR）及銀行流動性規則（BLR）在內的不同規則組別進行潛在立法修訂的需要，並於2025年上半年進行有關必要規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局計劃根據2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機所帶來的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的最新發展，更新若干SPM模組。這些模組包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the

關於香港金融管理局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。香港金融管理局有4項主要職能：\n- 在聯繫匯率制度的框架內維持貨幣穩定；\n- 推動金融體系的穩定與健全，包括銀行體系；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維持及發展香港的金融基礎設施；以及\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的法定職權\n\n香港金融管理局於1993年4月1日成立，這是在1992年立法會通過修訂《外匯基金條例》後，授權財政司長委任貨幣管理機構。\n\n貨幣管理局的權力、職能及責任載於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（解決辦法）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》及其他相關條例。財政司與貨幣管理局在貨幣及金融事務上的職能及責任劃分，載於2003年6月25日的函件交換中。該函件交換披露了財政司向貨幣管理局作出的權力轉授。這些函件為公開文件，可於香港金融管理局網站查閱。\n\n《外匯基金條例》設立外匯基金，由財政司司長管理。根據條例，該基金須主要用於影響港元匯率。亦可能（同時顧及其主要目的）用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣管理局根據《外匯基金條例》獲委任，協助財政司長執行其根據《外匯基金條例》所賦予的職能，並執行其他由其他條例或財政司長所指派的職能。貨幣管理局的職位稱為香港金融管理局（HKMA），而貨幣管理局為香港金融管理局的行政總裁。\n\n《銀行條例》規定，貨幣當局負有規管及監管銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任和權力。根據條例，貨幣當局負責認可香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性、文化適切性，以及是否正確使用詞彙表中指定的翻譯。\n1. **第一份翻譯**整體語法正確，語句流暢，並正確使用了詞彙表中的「規定」、「規管」、「監管」、「認可」等詞語。唯一可改進之處是「吸收存款業務」可簡化為「存款業務」，但這並非錯誤。\n2. **第二份翻譯**使用了「香港金融管理局」，這與原文中的「Monetary Authority」不完全對應，原文並未明確指出是「香港金融管理局」，因此此處可能過度具體化。此外，「存款機構」雖可接受，但不如「吸收存款公司」準確。\n3. **第三份翻譯**語法正確，但「接受存款業務」與「吸收存款業務」相比，語感稍顯生硬，且「貨幣機管局」並非官方稱謂，應使用「貨幣當局」。\n4. **第四份翻譯**語句斷裂，結構不清晰，且使用了「貨幣審查處」，這與原文不符，明顯錯誤。\n5. **第五份翻譯**錯誤地將「Monetary Authority」翻譯為「財政司司長」，這是嚴重的誤譯，且「鑑於存款業務」與詞彙表中「Taking」的正確翻譯「鑑於」不匹配，語義錯誤。\n6. **第六份翻譯**語法正確，但最後一句中「吸收存款公司的授權」與原文「authorization」不符，應為「認可」，而非「授權」。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「Monetary Authority」正確翻譯為「貨幣當局」，而非具體機構名稱。\n- 使用詞彙表中指定的翻譯，如「規定」、「規管」、「監管」、「認可」。\n- 避免語句斷裂或語義錯誤，如「鑑於存款業務」與「吸收存款業務」的差異。\n- 確保語句流暢自然，符合中文表達習慣。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n《銀行條例》規定，貨幣當局負有規管及監管銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任和權力。根據條例，貨幣當局負責認可香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》規定，貨幣管理局為銀行業實體的解決當局。貨幣管理局獲賦予一系列權力，以有秩序地解決不可持續經營的銀行業實體（其倒閉可能構成系統性風險）。其目的是維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n證券及期貨條例及強制性公積金計劃條例賦予貨幣當局有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的若干權力。\n\n根據保險條例，保險當局已將有關銀行保險業務的查察及調查權力轉授予貨幣當局。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，我們需關注語法正確性、語意準確性、語句流暢度以及是否符合中文表達習慣。首先，所有翻譯都正確使用了詞彙表中的對應詞彙，如「investigation」翻譯為「調查」、「inspection」為「查察」、「delegated」為「轉授」、「businesses」為「業務」、「relation」為「方面」，這一點值得肯定。\n然而，各版本在語序與語意清晰度上存在差異。例如，第一份翻譯語序較為自然，但「與銀行保險相關業務方面」略顯冗長；第二份翻譯語序較為符合中文習慣，但「將查察及調查銀行保險相關業務的權力轉授給貨幣管理局」語意稍顯混亂；第三份翻譯使用了「貨幣局」與「保險監察局」，與原文「Monetary Authority」與「Insurance Authority」不完全對應；第四份翻譯語序清晰，用詞準確，但「保險當局」與「貨幣當局」的稱謂與原文略有出入；第五份翻譯語意較為完整，但「金融管理局」與原文「Monetary Authority」不一致；第六份翻譯語序正確，但「涉及銀行的保險相關業務方面」語意略顯模糊。\n綜合考量語序、語意清晰度與詞彙準確性，第四份翻譯最接近原文語意，語序也較為自然，因此作為基礎進行優化。最終翻譯在保留其優點的同時，調整語序使其更符合中文表達習慣，並確保機構名稱與原文一致。\n\n反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資條例授權貨幣管理局監管銀行遵守條例下客戶盡職調查及記錄保存要求的合規情況。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予貨幣當局協助運作存款保障計劃，並啟動從存款保障計劃基金向已失敗的持牌銀行存款人支付補償的責任。\n\n支付系統及儲值設施條例規定，香港金融管理局可指定及監察若干重大清算及結算系統以及在香港運作的零售支付系統。該條例亦授權金融管理局管理電子及實體「設施」的牌照制度，這些設施用以儲存貨幣價值，並符合條例所規定的準則。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

公司治理\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於維持高標準的公司治理，因為良好的治理對於維持及保護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信心至關重要。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的內容，但在語感、用詞選擇與語法流暢度方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：用詞較為簡潔，但「保持高標準」與「維持高標準」相比，「維持」更符合原文「committed to high standards」的語境，強調持續維護的狀態。\n2. **第二譯文**：用詞準確，語句流暢，但「法定職權」與原文「statutory mandate」相比，「職責」更貼切，因「mandate」有「被賦予的任務」之意，而非「權力」。\n3. **第三譯文**：語句通順，但「至為重要」與「至關重要」相比，後者更符合正式語境，語氣更強。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句較長，結構稍顯複雜，且「信譽與信心」與原文「trust and confidence」相比，「信譽」並非原文重點，略顯冗餘。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句流暢，用詞準確，特別是「履行其法定職責所具有的信心」語意清晰，符合原文語境。\n6. **第六譯文**：「企業管治」與「公司治理」相比，後者更符合金融機構常用語，且「信任和信心」重複，略顯累贅。\n**改進方向：**\n- 選擇「維持」而非「保持」，以強調持續性的治理標準。\n- 使用「法定職責」而非「職權」或「職能」，以準確對應「statutory mandate」。\n- 使用「至關重要」而非「至為重要」，以符合正式語境。\n- 避免重複用詞，如「信任和信心」，應統一為「信心」。\n- 結構上應簡潔明瞭，避免過於複雜的句式。\n**最終翻譯：**\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於維持高標準的公司治理，因為良好的治理對於維持及保護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信心至關重要。\n\n為履行其對良好企業管治的承諾，香港金融管理局（HKMA）：\n- 制定清晰的治理架構，並具有高度的問責程度；\n-

香港金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）是香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府的一部分，但能夠以與公務員不同的條件聘請員工，以便吸引具備適當經驗和專門知識的人員。HKMA的行政總裁及其員工均為公職人員。在其日常工作中，HKMA在相關法定權力授予或轉授予貨幣管理局的範圍內，享有高度的自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體系的結構：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致貨幣當局的一封信中訂明，這些目標應為貨幣穩定，即透過貨幣局安排維持港元兌一美元約7.80的穩定匯率。貨幣當局自身負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括釐定達成目標的策略、工具及操作手段。貨幣當局亦有責任維持香港貨幣體系的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財政及庫務局局長的協助下，負責制定政策以維持香港金融體系的穩定與健全，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位。為支持這些政策，貨幣管理局的職責包括：  \n- 推動銀行體系的普遍穩定及有效運作；  \n- 與其他相關機構合作，推動債務市場的發展；  \n- 處理與法定貨幣紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通相關的事宜；  \n- 透過發展支付、清算及結算系統，並在適當情況下運作這些系統，以推動金融基礎設施的安全與效率；以及  \n- 與其他相關機構合作，力求提升香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推動市場發展措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\nThe junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, with correct use of the term “轉授” for “delegation.” However, “貨幣基金會” is an incorrect translation of “Exchange Fund,” which should be “匯兌基金” or “儲備基金.” The sentence structure is clear and fluent.\n2. **Second junior translator**: The term “發行基金” is an incorrect translation of “Exchange Fund.” The use of “轉授” is correct. The sentence is grammatically sound but suffers from the incorrect term for “Exchange Fund.”\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is problematic. “匯豐銀行note” is a complete misinterpretation of “Exchange Fund.” The term “授權” is used instead of “轉授,” which is not the exact match from the dictionary. The sentence structure is also awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The term “儲備基金” is a reasonable translation for “Exchange Fund.” The use of “轉授” is correct. The sentence is fluent and grammatically sound, though slightly repetitive in the use of “儲備基金.”\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: The term “匯豐儲備基金” is an incorrect and overly specific translation of “Exchange Fund.” The use of “轉授權力” is not the exact match from the dictionary. The sentence is otherwise clear and grammatically correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: The term “發行基金” is again an incorrect translation of “Exchange Fund.” The phrase “財政司司長轉授的貨幣管理局” is awkwardly structured. The use of “轉授” is correct, but the sentence lacks clarity.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use the correct term for “Exchange Fund,” which is likely “儲備基金” or “匯兌基金.” The term “轉授” should be used as specified in the dictionary. The sentence structure should be clear and grammatically correct, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved translation**:\n儲備基金由財政司司長控制。貨幣管理局根據財政司司長的轉授，就儲備基金的使用及基金的投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 責任與透明度\n\n香港貨幣管理局在日常運作及推動由政府釐定的政策目標所採用的方法上所給予的自主權，輔以高度的問責性及透明度。\n\n香港金融管理局透過推動貨幣及銀行體系的穩定、更有效管理官方儲備，以及制定並監察一個穩健且多元化的金融基礎設施，來服務香港。這些過程有助加強香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並促進香港的經濟發展。\n\n香港金融管理局必須獲得社會的信心，才能善盡其職責。因此，香港金融管理局以認真態度履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並努力應對社區內與其職責相關的任何關注事項。尤其，香港金融管理局透過傳統及社交媒體，及時澄清有關其政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n香港金融管理局透過財政司司長委任貨幣當局，以及透過立法會通過的法律設立貨幣當局的權力和責任，向香港人民負責。香港金融管理局亦承認有更廣泛的責任，推動對其角色和目標的更好了解，並保持對社區關注事項的了解。在日常運作及與社區的廣泛聯繫中，香港金融管理局奉行透明度和保持開放的政策。此政策有兩個主要目標：  \n- 在市場敏感性、商業機密及法定限制披露機密資訊的考慮下，盡量讓金融界和公眾充分了解香港金融管理局的工作；以及  \n- 確保香港金融管理局與其服務的社區保持聯繫，並對社區的需要作出回應。\n\n香港金融管理局旨在遵循國際最高標準的透明度安排。它與大眾傳媒保持廣泛的聯繫，並出版大量定期及特別刊物，包括英文及中文版本。香港金融管理局的雙語網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有大量香港金融管理局的刊物、新聞稿、講話及簡報，此外亦設有專門環節，內容涵蓋研究、統計、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他主題。在數碼時代，香港金融管理局亦運用社交媒體平台，以更有效的方式與公眾溝通。香港金融管理局在其辦公室設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館，每週六天對公眾開放。有關香港金融管理局在公眾溝通及聯繫方面的工作資訊，詳見第185至193頁的企業功能章節。\n\n多年來，香港金融管理局逐步提高對外匯基金及貨幣發行局賬戶資訊披露的詳細程度和頻率。自1999年起，香港金融管理局參與國際貨幣基金組織為中央銀行設立的特別數據發布標準專案。香港金融管理局發表外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣發行局小組委員會的會議記錄，以及貨幣發行局運作報告。自1996年起，銀行監管政策及指引已上載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n香港金融管理局與立法會的關係在推動問責制和透明度方面發揮重要作用。香港金融管理局總裁已作出正式承諾，每年三次出席立法會財務事務委員會，向成員簡報並回答有關香港金融管理局工作的查詢。香港金融管理局代表不時出席立法會委員會及專責小組的會議，解釋和商討特定問題，並協助議員審閱立法草案。\n\n# 控制項\n\n香港金融管理局採用強健的內部及外部控制機制，以確保其秉持高標準的員工行為、審慎的風險管理以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能提供獨立的評估，以檢視控制機制的充足性及有效性。\n\n# 行為準則\n\n行為準則已制定，用以向員工提供關於其道德和法律責任的指引，確保各級員工的行為符合指定的標準。\n\n# 內部控制\n\n# 運作控制、操作控制、作業控制、執行控制等翻譯均為「Operational controls」的合理對應詞，但各有側重。其中「作業控制」較為常見於企業管理與風險控制領域，語意明確且符合傳統中文語境。而「運作控制」與「操作控制」雖語意相近，但較少見於正式文件中。此外，「執行控制」則偏向於具體行動的控制，與「Operational controls」的廣義管理控制語境稍有出入。因此，「作業控制」為最佳選擇，語意準確且符合常見用法。最終翻譯為：\n作業控制\n\n所有部門及分處均有責任識別並評估其運作流程的風險，並落實適當的控制措施，以確保香港金融管理局日常運作的妥善進行。此為風險管理的第一道防線。\n所有部門及分處均有責任識別並評估其運作流程的風險，並落實適當的控制措施，以確保香港金融管理局日常運作的妥善進行。此為風險管理的第一道防線。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在企業層面進行，由香港金融管理局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n由部門識別的潛在及新興風險，以及其所制定的控制措施和緩解策略的充分性，會報告至風險委員會並於該委員會進行討論，風險委員會將決定適當的跟進行動。\n潛在及新興風險由部門識別，其所制定的控制措施及緩解策略之充分性，報告至風險委員會並於該委員會討論，並由該委員會決定適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部稽核\n\n香港金融管理局內部審計部獨立評估不同部門的治理、風險管理及控制程序的充分性及有效性，並就改善範疇提出建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《發鈔兌換基金條例》第7章，香港特別行政區政府審計委員會審核發鈔兌換基金的財務報表。該委員會不收取此服務費用。發鈔兌換基金的審核財務報表刊載於香港金融管理局年報內。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14).

經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年錄得正面增長，歸功於入境旅遊和內地需求的復甦。勞動市場隨着經濟復甦持續改善，而通脹則維持溫和。在金融條件收緊及市場情緒疲弱的情況下，資產市場依然偏軟。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，儘管前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在應對去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟於2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。在本地方面，私人消費在就業市場條件改善及政府推出的不同支持措施（如消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動）的推動下顯著復甦。儘管財務條件收緊，整體投資開支在與去年低基數比較的情況下仍錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港服務出口因入境旅遊的強勁復甦而反彈，主要歸功於此。然而，其正面影響被出境旅遊的強勁復甦所抵銷，出境旅遊被計算為服務進口。另一方面，貨物出口在外部需求疲弱的情況下維持低迷，拖累香港本地生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1 實質GDP增長按貢獻劃分  \n資料來源：統計處\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注語法正確性、語感自然度、用詞準確性以及是否符合中文表達習慣。\n1. **第一個翻譯**：「圖1 實質GDP增長的貢獻」語法正確，但「的貢獻」語感略顯生硬，未能準確傳達「by contribution」的語意，應為「按貢獻劃分」或「按貢獻」更為自然。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：「圖1 實際GDP增長按貢獻 資料來源：統計處」語法正確，但「按貢獻」後缺少「劃分」或「分類」等詞，語意略顯不完整。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：「圖 1 實際 GDP 增長，按貢獻劃分」語感自然，但「實際 GDP」與「實質 GDP」在經濟術語中略有差異，「實質 GDP」更常見於中文經濟報告中。此外，「香港政府統計處」雖具體，但原文未提及「香港」，因此略顯冗餘。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：「圖1 按貢獻計算的實際國內生產總值增長」語法正確，但「實際國內生產總值」與「實質 GDP」相比，前者較為冗長，且「按貢獻計算」語意與原文「by contribution」略有偏差。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：「圖 1 實質 GDP 增長貢獻」語法正確，但與第一個翻譯類似，語感略顯生硬，未能準確傳達「by contribution」的語意。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：「圖 1 實際國內生產總值增長按貢獻劃分」語感自然，但「實際國內生產總值」與「實質 GDP」相比，前者較為冗長，且「香港特別行政區政府統計處」過於具體，與原文「Census and Statistics Department」不完全對應。\n**改進方向：**\n- 使用「實質 GDP」而非「實際 GDP」或「實際國內生產總值」，更符合經濟術語的常用表達。\n- 使用「按貢獻劃分」來準確傳達「by contribution」的語意。\n- 「資料來源：統計處」簡潔明確，符合原文「Source: Census and Statistics Department」的語意，無需過度具體化。\n因此，最佳翻譯為：\n圖1 實質GDP增長按貢獻劃分  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目分類的實際國內生產總值增長（期間對比）  \n註：經調整的季對季國內固定資本形成總額變動率不可用。  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2023年本地通貨膨脹維持溫和，因外部價格壓力逐步緩解，儘管經濟復甦導致國內成本壓力微升，但整體仍大致受控（圖2）1。2023全年核心與整體通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動市場情況在2023年進一步改善，失業率於7月降至近十年低位的2.8%，其後幾個月均維持在低水平（圖3）。勞動需求與勞動供應均有所增加，分別反映於總就業人數的上升（圖3）及勞動人口的增加。鑒於香港人力短缺的情況，政府於2023年推出了不同輸入勞工計劃及吸引人才措施。與此同時，面對緊張的勞動市場情況，名義工資及勞動收入的年對年增長率逐步朝疫情前水平上升。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市在下半年轉為疲弱。延續2022年底的反彈，恆生指數於2023年1月27日以22,689點的全年高位收市（圖4）。其後指數回落，並進一步下跌至12月的低點，反映市場情緒疲弱，原因是美國及瑞士3月的銀行業問題，以及全球經濟前景轉弱和下半年金融環境收緊。恆生指數全年收市報17,047點，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首四個月因內地及香港復常而反彈，但其後隨着按揭利率上升及市場情緒疲弱，價格進一步回落。整體而言，2023年樓價同比下跌6.9%，而樓宇交易量進一步下跌4.5%，創紀錄新低43,002個單位。儘管樓價向下調整，房屋可負擔性仍維持緊張，但微升。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面對逆風，寫字樓、零售舖位及廠房價格進一步回落。寫字樓租金持續承受壓力，因居家辦公安排日益普及及供應量大，導致高空置率。另一方面，零售舖位租金在2023年因入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善而上升。\n\n圖4 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和步伐繼續復甦。入境旅遊將隨着接待能力的持續改善及政府推動盛事的工作而進一步擴大，而本地消費活動亦將受到穩定勞動市場的支持。政府將推進的不同基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支持。與此同時，香港的貨物出口可能隨着全球科技週期預期的回升而回穩。政府預測2024年實際GDP將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，前景因多個風險和不明朗因素而蒙上陰影，包括來自美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦步伐、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n# Inflation and the labour market\n## Review and Reasoning:\nThe original English text is a simple title: \"# Inflation and the labour market\". The junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese. Here's a critical evaluation of each:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"通貨膨脹與勞工市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately translates \"inflation\" as \"通貨膨脹\" and \"labour market\" as \"勞工市場\", which is standard in economic terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# 通膨與勞動市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"通膨\" as a more concise and commonly used abbreviation for \"通貨膨脹\", and \"勞動市場\" is also standard.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"#\" is retained, which is acceptable for titles, but may not be necessary in all contexts.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"通貨膨脹與勞動市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Similar to the first translation, with \"勞動市場\" instead of \"勞工市場\". Both are acceptable, though \"勞動市場\" is slightly more formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# 物價與勞動市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"物價\" for \"inflation\", which is a more general term for \"price level\" and may be used in some contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"物價\" is not the standard term for \"inflation\" in economic discussions, which may lead to confusion.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"通貨膨脹與勞動市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the third translation, with \"勞動市場\" and \"通貨膨脹\", which are both accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"物價膨脹\" for \"inflation\", which is a direct translation and may be understood in some contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"物價膨脹\" is not the standard term in economic terminology; \"通貨膨脹\" is more precise and widely used.\n## Conclusion and Best Translation:\nThe best translation should use the standard economic terminology: \"通貨膨脹\" for \"inflation\" and \"勞工市場\" or \"勞動市場\" for \"labour market\". Both are acceptable, but \"勞工市場\" is more commonly used in formal contexts. The use of \"#\" is optional and may be omitted if not required for formatting.\nThus, the best translation is: **\"通貨膨脹與勞工市場\"**.\n\n預計2024年本地通脹將保持溫和，外部價格壓力回落將協助抵銷經濟進一步復甦和房屋租金上升對國內成本的向上壓力。市場共識預測2024年的 headline 通脹率為2.1%，而政府預測 headline 和 underlying 通脹率將分別為2.4%和1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場將受到持續經濟復甦的支撐，同時各種勞工輸入和人才吸引計劃將繼續協助紓緩不同行業的人力短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、由美國及歐洲三月銀行風暴引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地和香港經濟復甦較預期為慢。儘管面對這些多個不利因素，香港銀行業仍維持健康，並持續受到雄厚資本和流動性緩衝的支持。儘管分類貸款比率有所增加，銀行業的資產質素仍保持健康。銀行的盈利能力顯著改善，這是由於淨利息收入較高所推動。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.85%增加至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由2022年底的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率的增加主要由於對內地房地產開發商風險敞口的評級下調。然而，銀行撥備的數額維持足夠。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋比率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若考慮分類貸款所擔保的抵押品市場價值，經調整的撥備覆蓋比率將達到約145%。與此同時，截至2023年底，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別為0.08%及0.30%，維持在低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行業資產品質  \n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、海外分行及主要海外子公司。  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局（HKMA）\n\n圖 6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a title for a chart, which includes the chart number, the subject of the chart (delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending), and the source (HKMA). The dictionary provides specific translations for \"Chart,\" \"6,\" and \"Source,\" but not for \"Card\" or \"Delinquency ratios.\"\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate, using \"違約比率\" for \"delinquency ratios,\" which is appropriate. However, \"香港金管局\" is the full name of HKMA, which is acceptable but slightly more formal than \"香港金融管理局\" used in other translations.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is very similar to the first, but uses \"香港金融管理局\" instead of \"香港金管局.\" This is a more commonly used name in official contexts and is more natural in Chinese.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** uses \"壞賬比率\" for \"delinquency ratios.\" While \"壞賬\" (bad debt) is related, it is not the exact equivalent of \"delinquency,\" which refers to overdue payments rather than fully defaulted loans. This is a minor but important distinction.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses \"違約率\" instead of \"違約比率.\" While both are acceptable, \"比率\" is more precise in the context of financial ratios.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is nearly identical to the fourth, but with a slightly different punctuation format. It is otherwise accurate.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses \"居住用按揭貸款\" instead of \"住宅按揭貸款.\" While both are correct, \"住宅\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to residential mortgages.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the most natural and commonly accepted terms in financial contexts. \"香港金融管理局\" is the standard name for HKMA in Chinese. \"違約比率\" is more precise than \"違約率\" when referring to financial ratios. \"住宅按揭貸款\" is more standard than \"居住用按揭貸款\" in this context. Therefore, the best translation combines these elements for clarity, accuracy, and fluency.\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n銀行業於2023年錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行在該年內的總體稅前經營利潤上升了62.1%，而稅後平均資產回報率則從去年同期的0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利的改善主要歸因於淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及與去年溫和虧損相比，2023年交易性投資產生了重大收益。此情況部分被貸款減值損失的增加（+28%）所抵銷，因為針對新增不良貸款已撥備了特定準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息率在2023年擴大至1.68%，較一年前的1.31%有所增加（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行表現  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖8 零售銀行的淨息差  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖9 零售銀行的成本收入比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2023年增長了0.9%，其中可流通債務工具持有量（+8.6%）及銀行間貸款（+4.4%）的增幅，大部分被總貸款的下跌所抵銷。在借貸成本較高及全球經濟前景轉弱的情況下，貸款需求受壓，總貸款在2023年減少3.6%。總貸款中，用於香港的貸款大致維持穩定（-0.4%），而用於香港以外地區及貿易融資的貸款則分別減少10.4%及13.1%。與內地相關的貸款在2023年下降6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，總存款在2023年上升了5.1%，相比2022年的1.7%增長。由於總貸款下跌而總存款增加，整體貸款與存款比率從2022年底的68.5%下降至2023年底的62.8%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業在2023年維持資本充足。本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）綜合總資本比率於2023年底為21.1%，相比一年前的20.1%。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11）。兩項比率均遠高於其對應的國際最低要求。巴塞爾III槓桿比率於2023年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行業貸款及存款  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖11 本地註冊持牌機構綜合資本比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：準確性、語法正確性、語感自然度、文化適切性，以及是否正確使用詞彙表中的對應詞語。\n1. **第一份翻譯**：「圖11 本地註冊持牌機構綜合資本比率 資料來源：香港金融管理局」  \n   - **優點**：語法正確，語感自然，正確使用了「資料來源」與「圖」，並正確翻譯了「本地註冊」與「綜合」。\n   - **缺點**：未明確翻譯「AIs」，但根據上下文，「持牌機構」已能涵蓋其意，因此可接受。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：「圖 11 本地註冊 AIs 的 綜合資本比率 資料來源: HKMA」  \n   - **優點**：保留了「AIs」，並正確使用了「資料來源」與「圖」。\n   - **缺點**：語感較生硬，「的」字使用過多，且未將「AIs」翻譯為「持牌機構」，可能導致讀者困惑。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：「圖 11 綜合資本比率（本地註冊的AI）  \n   資料來源：香港金融管理局」  \n   - **優點**：結構清晰，正確使用了「資料來源」與「圖」。\n   - **缺點**：「AI」未翻譯為「持牌機構」，且括號使用不夠正式。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：「圖11 本地註冊人工智能的綜合資本比率  \n   資料來源：香港金管局」  \n   - **缺點**：將「AIs」誤譯為「人工智能」，與原文語境不符，且「金管局」與「金融管理局」不一致。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：「圖11 本地註冊的資產管理公司綜合資本比率  \n   資料來源：香港金融管理局」  \n   - **缺點**：將「AIs」誤譯為「資產管理公司」，與原文語境不符，可能導致誤解。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：「圖11 本地註冊人工智能的綜合資本比率  \n   資料來源：香港金融管理局」  \n   - **缺點**：與第四份翻譯相同，將「AIs」誤譯為「人工智能」，與原文語境不符。\n**改進建議：**  \n- 「AIs」應根據上下文翻譯為「持牌機構」，以符合金融領域的常用術語。\n- 「HKMA」應翻譯為「香港金融管理局」，而非「金管局」。\n- 標點符號與語感需更自然，避免過多「的」字與不正式的括號使用。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n圖11 本地註冊持牌機構綜合資本比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖12 本地註冊AIs的綜合槓桿比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行業持續維持雄厚的流動性地位。2023年第四季，第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖13）。銀行業的主要資金來源持續為客戶存款。2023年底，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）與第二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）分別為144.4%與169.4%（圖14）。所有四項比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13 指定機構的流動性比率  \n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖十四 指定人工智慧的資金比例  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system.

貨幣穩定性\n\n2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將「維持高水準較長時間」的情況下，港元大部分時間交易於可兌換範圍的疲弱一方，自2月中至5月初，疲弱一方的可兌換承擔機制被觸發8次。自5月起，港元已回升一些動能，年底時交易約在7.8的中心平價水平。聯繫匯率制度於2023年迎來其40周年紀念，根據該制度，香港銀行同業拆借利率通常追蹤其美元對應物，亦受本地供應與需求影響。整體而言，港元匯兌及貨幣市場維持穩健，交易過程暢順且有秩序。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次體現其應對不同外部衝擊的強韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為港元在對美元的外匯市場匯率方面保持穩定的外部價值，即在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。貨幣體系的結構採用貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備資產支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須由美元儲備資產的相應變化來完全對應。\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為港元在對美元的外匯市場匯率方面保持穩定的外部價值，即在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。貨幣體系的結構採用貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備資產支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須由美元儲備資產的相應變化來完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證書，為三家發行銀行所發行的紙幣提供全面支持；\n- 政府發行並在市面上流通的紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘額，即設於香港金融管理局的清算賬戶餘額總和；以及\n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）而維持。當強方（或弱方）CU被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）的匯率，向（或從）銀行沽出（或買入）港元，總結餘將會擴大（或收縮），以壓低（或推高）港元利率，協助將港元匯率回復至7.75至7.85的可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持較高水平的情況下，港元在2023年全年大部分時間持續疲弱，並主要交易於可兌換範圍的弱方。自2月中至5月初，弱方兌換率共觸發8次。港元匯率於5月初至7月期間有所回升，部分由上市公司派發股息相關需求及企業半年底資金需求所推動。其後，港元主要由本地資金需求的變化所推動，例如南向股票通的買入資金流動，並於年底時段交易於7.8的中心平價附近（圖1）。整體而言，港元匯率市場於2023年全年持續正常運作。\n\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n圖 1 2023年市場匯率\n圖一 二零二三年市場匯率\n圖1 外匯市場匯率 2023年\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n所有翻譯都正確使用了「Chart」對應的「圖」字，符合詞典要求。各版本在語法和用詞上均無明顯錯誤，但細節上略有差異：\n1. 第一、二、六版使用「圖1 2023年市場匯率」，格式簡潔，符合常見標題格式。\n2. 第三版在「圖」與「1」之間加了空格，雖然不影響理解，但略顯不規範。\n3. 第四版使用「圖一」與「二零二三年」，前者較少見於正式標題，後者為數字寫法，語氣較為口語。\n4. 第五版加入「外匯」一詞，使「市場匯率」成為「外匯市場匯率」，語意更明確，但原句未提及「外匯」，可能過度擴展。\n最佳翻譯應簡潔、符合常見標題格式，並忠實反映原文。因此，採用「圖1 2023年市場匯率」為最佳選擇。\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n\n從二月至五月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行的要求，在弱方兌換保證水平買入總計515億港元。反映弱方兌換保證水平的觸發，總準備金由2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。與此同時，未償還的EFBNs在全年內微升，由1,200.4億港元增至1,245.5億港元。因此，總準備金與未償還EFBNs總額由2022年底的1,296.7億港元下跌至2023年底的1,290.4億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎全年維持充分由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 2023年總餘額（未經貼現窗口調整）及未償還外匯基金證券\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary term \"未償還\" for \"outstanding\" and \"圖\" for \"Chart.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"發鈔基金紙幣\" is not an accurate translation of \"Exchange Fund papers.\" \"發鈔基金\" implies a \"issuing fund,\" which is not the same as \"Exchange Fund.\" Also, the phrase \"總餘額\" is acceptable, but the structure is somewhat awkward.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"未償還\" correctly and includes \"聯邦基金票據,\" which is closer to \"Exchange Fund papers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"聯邦基金\" is \"Federal Fund,\" not \"Exchange Fund.\" Also, \"結餘總額\" is not the best phrasing for \"Aggregate Balance.\" The phrase \"未經貼現窗處理\" is unnecessarily wordy.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"未償還\" correctly. \"外匯基金證券\" is a more accurate translation of \"Exchange Fund papers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"貼現窗口前\" is slightly awkward. It should be \"未經貼現窗口調整\" or \"在貼現窗口前.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"未償還\" correctly. \"發行基金紙幣\" is closer to \"Exchange Fund papers\" than \"發鈔基金紙幣.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"發行基金\" is not the standard term for \"Exchange Fund.\" Also, \"總結餘額\" is slightly off compared to \"Aggregate Balance.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"未償還\" correctly. \"結匯基金票據\" is a reasonable attempt at \"Exchange Fund papers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"總結餘\" is not the best translation for \"Aggregate Balance.\" Also, the structure is awkward.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"未償還\" correctly. \"交換基金紙幣\" is a direct translation of \"Exchange Fund papers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The placement of \"於2023年\" at the end is awkward and disrupts the flow.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"圖\" for \"Chart\" and \"未償還\" for \"outstanding.\" \"Exchange Fund papers\" should be translated as \"外匯基金證券\" to reflect the financial nature of the term. \"Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window)\" should be translated as \"總餘額（未經貼現窗口調整）\" to convey the idea of a balance before a specific adjustment. The structure should be concise and natural in Traditional Chinese, avoiding awkward phrasing and ensuring clarity.\n\n# 貨幣市場\n# Money market\n貨幣市場\n\n根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）一般跟隨其美元對應利率。由於美國在2023年頭七個月持續上調利率，HIBORs一般也上升（圖3）。全年來看，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n在評估六位初級翻譯的版本後，可以看出他們在整體語意傳達上大致正確，但在語法、用詞、語序與文化適應性方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一版翻譯**：語意大致正確，但「基地利率」應為「基準利率」，且「年底七月」語序不自然，應為「7月底」。此外，「貼現窗口貸款增至2023年的388億港元」語序略顯生硬。\n2. **第二版翻譯**：語意清晰，用詞較為準確，如「基準利率」、「最佳貸款利率」等。但「7月下旬」與原文「late July」不完全對應，應為「7月底」。此外，「相關使用情況」可更自然地說為「相關使用率」。\n3. **第三版翻譯**：語意正確，語序自然，用詞準確，如「提高」、「HIBOR基礎按揭利率」等。但「貨幣市場」與原文「money markets」更貼切，應使用「貨幣市場」而非「資金市場」。\n4. **第四版翻譯**：存在明顯錯誤，如「基於利率經調整上升四項」語意不清，且「由5.75% 上升至 5.75%」明顯錯誤。此外，「年初5月」與「年底7月」語序不自然，應為「5月初」與「7月底」。\n5. **第五版翻譯**：語意正確，語序自然，用詞準確，如「基準利率」、「HIBOR基準按揭利率」等。但「貨幣市場」與「資金市場」語意略有差異，應根據原文選擇更貼切的詞語。\n6. **第六版翻譯**：語意正確，語序自然，但「以下美國政策利率上調」語序不自然，應為「美國政策利率上調後」。此外，「再貼現窗口借款」與「貼現窗口貸款」語意略有差異，應統一用詞。\n**改進建議**：\n- 確保所有字詞符合詞典要求，如「base rate」應為「基準利率」，「HIBOR-based」應為「基於HIBOR」。\n- 確保時間表達準確，如「late July」應為「7月底」，而非「7月下旬」或「年底七月」。\n- 確保語序自然，符合中文語法習慣，如「在美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後」比「以下美國聯邦資金利率目標範圍增設後」更自然。\n- 確保數字與單位正確，如「38.8億港元」應為「388億港元」，避免小數點誤用。\n**最佳翻譯如下**：\n在美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，基準利率經調整上調四次，總計提高一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上調至5.75%。在零售方面，跟隨美國政策利率上調，多間銀行於5月初將其最高貸款利率提高12.5個基點，並於7月底再提高12.5個基點。一些銀行亦在當年提高了新核准按揭貸款的HIBOR基準按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款在2023年增至388億港元，較2022年的84億港元增加，相關使用率未見異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"Chart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023.\" The dictionary specifies that \"Chart\" must be translated as \"圖.\"\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"圖3 2023年香港銀行間拆借利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖\" for \"Chart.\" The term \"銀行間拆借利率\" is a direct and accurate translation of \"Interbank Offered Rates.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"拆借利率\" is slightly more formal and may be less commonly used in financial contexts compared to \"拆息率.\"\n2. **Translation 2:** \"圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖.\" \"銀行同業拆息率\" is a natural and commonly used term in financial contexts in Traditional Chinese.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong and fluent translation.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"圖3 二零二三年香港銀行同業拆息率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖\" and \"銀行同業拆息率.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"二零二三年\" is less common in formal or financial contexts compared to \"2023年.\" It is more colloquial and may not be preferred in official or professional documents.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"圖 3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖\" and \"2023年.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"拆息利率\" is redundant and less natural. \"拆息率\" is sufficient and more commonly used.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆借利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖\" and \"2023年.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"拆借利率\" is slightly more formal and less commonly used in financial contexts compared to \"拆息率.\"\n6. **Translation 6:** \"圖3 香港銀行間拆借利率 2023年\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"圖\" and \"銀行間拆借利率.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** The placement of \"2023年\" at the end is less conventional and may confuse the reader. It is more natural to place the year after the main title.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"圖\" for \"Chart,\" a natural and commonly used financial term for \"Interbank Offered Rates,\" and place the year in a conventional position. \"銀行同業拆息率\" is the most natural and commonly used term in financial contexts. Placing \"2023年\" immediately after the title is standard in such contexts.\nThus, the best translation is:  \n**圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率**\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去四十年來一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並體現出其應對挑戰的強大與韌性。儘管美國利率路徑和全球經濟復甦仍存在持續的不明朗因素，香港的港元匯兌及貨幣市場仍持續以有秩序的方式運作，反映出聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。特區政府堅決支持聯繫匯率制度。在2023年的外匯部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信性已透過一套透明的規則、龐大的財政和外匯儲備、雄厚的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體制以及審慎的財政框架得以確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續暢順運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率按國際標準表現非常良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從外匯基金資產中配置特定部分用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超越了112.5%的上限觸發水平（圖4）。這主要反映了由於上半年觸發弱方CU所導致的總結餘收縮。根據外匯基金諮詢委員會核准的安排，以及債務證券贖回的結果，資產從支持組合轉移至投資組合，使支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收於110.73%。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。外匯基金充足的財務資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2023年支持比率的每日變動\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有翻譯都正確使用了詞彙表中的對應詞彙：「Chart」翻譯為「圖」，「backing」翻譯為「支持」，「movement」翻譯為「變動」。然而，各版本在語序、標點與語感上略有差異。\n1. **第一版**：「圖4 2023年每日支持比率的變動」語序自然，符合中文表達習慣，但「每日」與「變動」之間的語感略顯生硬。\n2. **第二版**：「圖4 2023年支持比率的每日變動」語序與第一版相似，但將「每日」放在「變動」前，語感更自然。\n3. **第三版**：與第二版幾乎相同，僅在「圖」與「4」之間多了一個空格，對語義無影響。\n4. **第四版**：「圖4：2023年每日支持比率變動」使用冒號，語感較為正式，但略顯簡略，缺少「的」字，語法上稍顯不完整。\n5. **第五版**：「圖4 2023年支持比率的日變動」使用「日變動」，語感較為正式，但與「每日變動」相比，語義稍有差異。\n6. **第六版**：與第二版相同，僅在句末多了一個句號，語法上無誤，但略顯冗餘。\n**改進方向：**  \n在語序上，「支持比率的每日變動」比「每日支持比率的變動」更符合中文語法習慣，語感更自然。此外，標點符號的使用應保持一致，避免不必要的冒號或句號。最終版本採用「圖4 2023年支持比率的每日變動」，語序自然、語法正確，符合中文表達習慣。\n\n# 貨幣局小組委員會\n\n香港金融管理局外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行局次級委員會（CBC）監察並審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2023年，CBC考慮了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩盤、聯邦儲備系統美元流動性後備措施對香港銀行的傳導，以及近期香港美元利率的變化等問題。CBC就這些問題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已載於香港金融管理局網站上。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n下表總結了截至2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣的價值：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有六個翻譯版本都正確地使用了「年底」來翻譯「end」，符合詞典要求。從語法和語義上來看，這些翻譯都準確傳達了原文的意思，即「下表總結了2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣的價值」。\n然而，從語感和語流的角度來看，翻譯版本1和3在語句結構上更為自然。版本1使用「總結了2023年底流通中的紙幣及硬幣的價值」，語序較為流暢，且「及」字在中文中常用於並列結構，語氣更為正式。版本3使用「截至2023年底」，語義更明確，強調時間點，語感也較為自然。\n版本2和4雖然語法正確，但「截至」與「截至」的使用略顯重複，且「價值」前缺少「的」字，語感稍顯生硬。版本5和6與版本4幾乎相同，語感也較為平淡。\n因此，最佳的翻譯應當在語義準確的基礎上，追求語感自然、語序流暢，並符合中文的語法習慣。結合以上分析，選擇版本3的語序，並加入「的」字使語句更完整，最終翻譯為：「下表總結了截至2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣的價值。」\n\n圖5 2023年底各發行銀行流通紙幣數量\n\n圖6 2023年底流通紙幣的分布\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a title for a chart: \"Chart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023.\" The goal is to translate this title into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese, while adhering to the dictionary provided.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"圖6 流通中紙幣的分布年底2023年\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"年底2023年\" is awkward and redundant. \"年底\" already means \"end of the year,\" so adding \"2023年\" after it is unnecessary and disrupts the flow.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"圖6 2023年底流通紙幣的分布情況\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It uses \"2023年底\" correctly and includes \"分布情況,\" which is a natural way to express \"distribution\" in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"情況\" adds extra meaning not present in the original, slightly altering the focus from a factual distribution to a situational one.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"圖6 2023年底流通紙幣分布\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It is concise and follows the structure of the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The word \"分布\" is used without a particle, which is acceptable in titles but may feel slightly abrupt in a more formal context.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"圖6 2023年底流通紙幣的分布\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is very close to the ideal translation. It uses \"的\" correctly to link \"流通紙幣\" and \"分布,\" and the structure is natural and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"圖 6 於2023年底流通紙幣分佈\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"於\" is unnecessary and adds a level of formality not required in a chart title. Also, \"分佈\" is a variant of \"分布\" but is less commonly used in formal contexts.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"圖 6 2023年底流通紙幣的發行量分布\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** This translation introduces \"發行量\" (issuance volume), which is not present in the original text. This changes the meaning from \"distribution in circulation\" to \"distribution of issuance volume,\" which is incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural. It should use the dictionary terms correctly and avoid adding or omitting meaning. Based on the above analysis, **Translation 4** is the most accurate and natural, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\n圖6 2023年底流通紙幣的分布\n\n圖7

硬幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收藏計劃持續受到公眾的歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資訊，可查閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中的「可持續HKMA」章節。\n\n# 兌換基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN計劃運作暢順。截至2023年底，未償還的外匯基金紙幣名義金額約為HK$1,255.4億（表2）。\n\n表2 EFBNs未償還問題\n審閱與分析：\n各譯文皆正確使用了「未償還」來翻譯「outstanding」，符合詞典要求。然而在語序與語感上仍有改進空間。\n第一譯文「表 2 未償還的 EFBN 問題」語序較為自然，但「EFBN」應保留英文縮寫，因其為專有名詞。第二譯文「表2 EFBNs未償還事項」語序正確，但「事項」較「問題」更偏向行政用語，與「issues」語感稍有出入。第三譯文「表2 EFBNs 未償還問題」語序正確，但「EFBNs」與「未償還問題」之間缺少連接詞，略顯生硬。第四譯文「表2 未償還的EFBN問題」語序自然，但「未償還的」與「EFBN」之間缺少適當的連接詞，語感稍顯突兀。第五譯文「表 2 EFBN 的未償還問題」語序正確，但「的」字使用過多，略顯累贅。第六譯文「表2 EFBNs未償還問題」語序正確，但「EFBNs」與「未償還問題」之間缺少適當的連接詞，語感稍顯生硬。\n最佳改進方向為在「EFBNs」與「未償還問題」之間加入適當的連接詞，使語句更自然流暢。同時，應保留「EFBNs」的英文縮寫，因其為專有名詞，不宜翻譯為中文。\n最終翻譯：\n表2 EFBNs未償還問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融研究院（HKIMR）3為香港財經學院的研究機構，發表了20篇工作論文，並舉辦了17場研討會／網絡研討會，探討對香港及該區具有戰略重要性的貨幣及金融研究題目。HKIMR亦在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發表了六份電子期刊，以向SSRN的全球研究社群傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供最近發表的工作論文之高層次、非專門性概要，HKIMR發表了兩期《貨幣研究見解》。\n\n除了其研究活動外，HKIMR舉辦了四項國際活動、一個圓桌會議及四場研討會\/線上研討會，與學術界、全球央行及國際金融機構推動經濟和金融議題的對話與交流。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, using the correct dictionary terms (e.g., “4項”, “推動”). However, it uses “HKIMR” without expanding it, which may be unclear to some readers.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** correctly uses the dictionary terms and provides a clear structure. However, it adds “香港金融研究中心” (Hong Kong Financial Research Center), which is not in the original text and may be misleading if HKIMR is an acronym for a different entity.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** incorrectly expands “HKIMR” as “香港金融科技研究小組” (Hong Kong Fintech Research Group), which is not supported by the original text and introduces an inaccurate term.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is accurate and fluent, using the correct dictionary terms. It also maintains the structure of the original sentence and avoids unnecessary additions. However, it uses “四項” instead of “4項”, which is acceptable but less consistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is fluent and accurate, but it adds “學界” (academic community) and “討論與交換” (discussion and exchange), which are not in the original text and slightly alter the meaning.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is accurate and fluent, using the correct dictionary terms. It also avoids unnecessary additions and maintains the structure of the original sentence.

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年儘管面對多個挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行風暴、高利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍維持雄厚且具韌性。香港金融管理局迅速應對三月的銀行風暴，從管理餘波至完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管程序及解決框架等範疇），為本地銀行業汲取經驗，同時維持其重點在於授權機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益嚴重，以及第三方提供的科技服務使用量增加，香港金融管理局亦與授權機構緊密合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局在支付卡方面提升消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂《銀行業守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，推出《跨境財富管理通證試點計劃》的提升措施，並開始監管信託業務。為準備提供「信貸數據智庫」下的消費者信貸參考服務，推出了試點計劃。\n\n香港金管局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，展現了其以風險為本的策略應對最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙，金管局透過推出即時詐騙監測系統，並拓寬公私部門資訊共享合作的範圍，加強生態系統的協作，包括成立「詐騙及洗錢情報工作組」。推出一個具有突破性的平台，以便利銀行間資訊共享，將有助應對「人頭帳戶網絡」的風險。同時，金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協調行動，處理日益增加的與詐騙相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙手法的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統進行交易前的預警機制。與此同時，監管科技能力亦透過「宏觀分析」試驗計劃得到加強。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和信息披露等標準。亦在加強銀行業能力建設、吸引和培育未來人才以及提升現有從業人員技能方面作出顯著努力。此外，香港存款保障局已完成就擬議存款保障計劃提升措施的公眾諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動其工作，以確保可信的解決機制。一項與接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準已制定完成，並已完成對實施損失吸收能力政策標準經驗的審視。在與銀行進行解決規劃方面，已取得重大進展，以應對解決過程中的早期終止風險及運作連續性。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，以推動解決事宜。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局有一個普遍的目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。達成此目標有賴於一個具極高韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營業務的方式，會影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下可能以失序方式失敗。貨幣當局作為監管機構，擔當保護金融穩定的關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備韌性以應對震盪，並能在危機中復甦其狀況，最終協助防止失敗。貨幣當局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣當局作為解決機構，旨在確保在人工智能機構變得不可持續經營時，其倒閉可以有秩序地管理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的解決機制，其中貨幣當局是人工智能機構及其他類別機構的解決機構。為落實香港的解決機制，制定解決規則及政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除對人工智能機構可解決性的阻礙，並發展貨幣當局處理失敗人工智能機構的運作能力至關重要。為更有效執行這些工作，貨幣當局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n貨幣管理局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。在監察FMIs時，金管局旨在推動其普遍的安全與效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。使FMIs更具韌性以應對金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融系統，免受FMIs中斷所引致的可能破壊性影響。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 授權許可\n\n在本年內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）向兩間在香港境外註冊的銀行授予一個銀行牌照及一個限制性銀行牌照。HKMA亦向四間外國交易平台營運商授予貨幣經紀批准，並撤銷另一次授予一個貨幣經紀的批准。HKMA在本年內撤銷五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，可於附錄及表格D至F分別查閱，分別位於第313至316頁及第322至325頁。\n\n# 三層銀行體系審查  \n三層銀行體系檢討  \n三級銀行體系評論  \n三層銀行體系評述  \n審閱三層銀行體系  \n三層銀行體系回顧  \n以上六種翻譯均為「Review of three-tier banking system」的中文翻譯，但各有優缺點。首先，「三層銀行體系」是對「three-tier banking system」的正確翻譯，語意明確，符合金融專業用語。然而，「Review」一詞在不同翻譯中被處理為「審查」、「檢討」、「評論」、「評述」、「審閱」、「回顧」，這些詞語在語意上略有差異，需根據語境選擇最合適的詞。\n「審查」與「審閱」偏向於正式、嚴謹的審核過程，常用於官方或機構性質的文件中，語氣較為嚴肅；「檢討」則帶有反思與改進的意味，常見於報告或政策評估中；「評論」與「評述」則偏向於分析與評價，語氣較為客觀；「回顧」則強調對過去事件的總結與回顧，語氣較為中性。\n根據原文「Review of three-tier banking system」的語境，此處的「Review」應指對三層銀行體系的系統性分析與評估，而非嚴肅的審核或反思。因此，「評述」或「評論」較為合適，語氣客觀且符合專業分析的語境。\n此外，部分翻譯在格式上使用了「#」符號，此為非正式標記，不適合用於正式文件或專業報告中，應予以刪除。\n綜合考量語意、語氣與格式，最佳翻譯應為「三層銀行體系評述」，語意明確、語氣客觀，符合專業分析的語境，且格式規範。\n三層銀行體系評述\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了一項全面檢討，針對三層銀行體系，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。檢討發現，三層體系已變得比原來為在銀行體系入行靈活性與保護小存款人之間取得平衡的目標所必需的更加複雜。其後，香港金融管理局於6月開始為期三個月的諮詢，就簡化三層銀行體系為兩層的建議進行磋商，建議將吸收存款的公司合併至受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二層。回應者普遍支持該建議。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理及風險管理。作為香港金融管理局持續推動更強風險治理的一部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、授權機構及其外部審計師之間亦舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦對廣泛的持牌機構活動進行了定期的現場檢查。在高息率環境及部分內地房地產發展商債務違約的情況下，信貸風險管理成為重點，因當前信貸風險環境充滿挑戰。隨著持牌機構應用科技的趨勢進一步加速，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一重點。香港金融管理局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出了一輪以氣候相關風險治理為重點的主題檢查，以及一連串諮詢環節，以向持牌機構提供監管指引。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國及歐洲銀行危機，就規模和範圍而言，是自2008年重大金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力事件。在危機發展期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）保持高度警覺，並採取一系列預防性行動，以確保任何潛在後果不會影響本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件後，HKMA進行內部檢討，顧及從危機中獲得的觀察和經驗。基於此檢討，HKMA制定詳細行動計劃，納入所學經驗，以加強監管有效性，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的流動性及市場風險。\n\n在進行監管方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事項進行現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為風險較高或新措施的範疇進行主題性審查。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation 1** 使用了「進行監管方面」，語意清晰，但「監管方面」略顯生硬，不如「進行監管」自然。此外，「現場檢查」與「主題性審查」搭配合理，但「輔以針對評估為風險較高或新措施的範疇」語序稍顯複雜，影響流暢度。\n2. **Translation 2** 使用了「監管機構行為」，與原文「conduct supervision」不完全對應，可能引起誤解。此外，「風險較高領域」與「新措施」之間的連接詞使用得當，但整體語氣較為正式，略顯僵硬。\n3. **Translation 3** 使用了「進行監察」，與「conduct」對應較為準確，但「現場審查」與「主題審閱」搭配稍顯不一致，語意上略顯混亂。此外，「配合對評估風險較高或新舉措的範疇」語序不夠自然。\n4. **Translation 4** 使用了「進行監理」，與「conduct」對應較為準確，語意清晰。此外，「強積金（MPF）」是「強制性公積金」的簡稱，與原文一致，但「主題審查」與「現場檢查」搭配自然，整體語句流暢。\n5. **Translation 5** 使用了「進行監督」，與「conduct」對應準確，語意清晰。此外，「強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）」與原文略有出入，應使用「強制性公積金（MPF）」。整體語句流暢，但「針對評估為較高風險或新舉措的範疇」語序稍顯複雜。\n6. **Translation 6** 使用了「監督執行情況」，與原文「conduct supervision」不完全對應，可能引起誤解。此外，「香港金融管理專員處」與原文「HKMA」不一致，應使用「香港金融管理局」。整體語句較為正式，但略顯生硬。\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n在進行監管方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事項進行現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為風險較高或新措施的範疇進行主題性審查。\n此版本結合了多個優點：使用「進行監管」準確對應「conduct supervision」，語意清晰；「現場檢查」與「主題性審查」搭配自然，語句流暢；「強制性公積金（MPF）」與原文一致，避免誤解；整體語氣自然，符合傳統中文的語法與文化習慣。\n\n表1載有香港金融管理局2023年的監管活動概要。\n\n表1 監督活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款在2023年減少3.6%，相比2022年的3.0%下跌。表2列明貸款及推進的增長細節。與內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及推進的增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地樓市持續疲弱的情況下，加強監管努力，監測銀行機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理實務。銀行業的資產質素在當年惡化，但維持在可控範圍內。截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在年度內，香港金融管理局進行了針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估持牌機構的信貸風險管理，重點關注對易受影響行業的風險敞口、優先融資、對香港以外業務信貸風險的監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, with proper use of the dictionary terms: \"year\" → \"年度\", \"conducted\" → \"進行\", \"sectors\" → \"行業\". The translation is natural and maintains the formal tone of the original text. However, it uses \"持牌機構\" (licensed institutions) instead of \"AIs\" (Authorized Institutions), which may be acceptable depending on context, but could be more precise if \"AIs\" is a known term in the financial sector.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses \"人工智能\" (artificial intelligence) instead of \"AIs\" (Authorized Institutions), which is a clear error. It also uses \"保單融資\" (policy financing) instead of \"premium financing\", which is not an exact match. The term \"審查\" (review) is used instead of \"檢查\" (examination), which is slightly different in nuance.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"進行\" and \"行業\". However, it uses \"人工智能\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"溢價融資\" (premium financing), which is a direct translation but may not be the most natural term in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** incorrectly retains \"insurance premiums\" as \"保險 premiums 融資\", which is awkward and unidiomatic. It also uses \"人工智能機構\" (artificial intelligence institutions), which is incorrect.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** uses \"人工智能\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"脆弱行業\" (vulnerable industries), which is slightly different from \"vulnerable sectors\" and may not be the best fit.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses \"銀行\" (banks) instead of \"AIs\" (Authorized Institutions), which is a misinterpretation. It also uses \"優先貸款融資\" (priority loan financing) instead of \"premium financing\", which is not an exact match.\n**Improved Translation:**\n在年度內，香港金融管理局進行了針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估持牌機構的信貸風險管理，重點關注對易受影響行業的風險敞口、優先融資、對香港以外業務信貸風險的監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶面對的現金流壓力\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original English title: *Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers*. Each translation uses the dictionary terms \"faced\" → \"面對\" and \"pressure\" → \"壓力\" correctly, which is a positive point.\nHowever, there are differences in fluency, grammar, and naturalness:\n1. **Translation 1:** *# 缓解銀行客戶面臨的現金流壓力*  \n   - Uses \"面臨\" for \"faced,\" which is acceptable but slightly more formal than \"面對.\"\n   - The structure is grammatically correct and natural.\n2. **Translation 2:** *# 減輕銀行客戶面對的現金流壓力*  \n   - Uses \"減輕\" for \"alleviating,\" which is appropriate.\n   - \"面對\" is used for \"faced,\" which is natural and commonly used in such contexts.\n   - This translation is fluent and natural.\n3. **Translation 3:** *減輕銀行客戶面對的資金流壓力。*  \n   - Uses \"資金流\" instead of \"現金流,\" which is a minor but notable error. \"現金流\" is the correct term in financial contexts.\n   - The structure is otherwise correct.\n4. **Translation 4:** *# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力*  \n   - Uses \"所面臨\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more complex than necessary.\n   - The translation is still natural but slightly less concise.\n5. **Translation 5:** *# 緩解銀行客戶所面對的現金流壓力*  \n   - Similar to Translation 4, with \"所面對\" instead of \"面對.\"\n   - Again, grammatically correct but slightly wordy.\n6. **Translation 6:** *# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力*  \n   - Identical to Translation 4, with the same issues.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- \"減輕\" and \"緩解\" are both acceptable for \"alleviating,\" but \"減輕\" is more commonly used in the context of reducing pressure or burden.\n- \"面對\" is more natural and commonly used in everyday and business contexts compared to \"面臨\" or \"所面對.\"\n- \"現金流\" is the correct financial term, not \"資金流.\"\n- The use of \"所\" in translations 4, 5, and 6 adds unnecessary complexity and is not required in this context.\n**Best Translation:**\nBased on the above considerations, the most natural and fluent translation would be:\n**# 減輕銀行客戶面對的現金流壓力**\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於七月宣布啟動有序退出預核准本金償還假期計劃。該計劃於2020年5月推出，旨在協助符合資格的企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業行業的意見，已提升部分本金償還選擇，以協助企業逐步恢復正常償還。即使在疫情結束後，若某些行業或個別借款人仍面臨困難，銀行會根據個別情況繼續提供本金寬限期或其他適合的信貸緩解措施。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業之資金需求時，表現同理心。香港金融管理局提醒銀行在處理遇到償還問題的企業時，應遵循「香港企業困難處理方法」的指引，使參與的貸款人能夠在共同利益下協同行事。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"handling\" as \"處理\", \"funding\" as \"資金\", \"individual\" as \"個別\", \"facing\" as \"面臨\", \"lenders\" as \"貸款人\", \"common\" as \"共同\", \"also\" as \"亦\", \"needs\" as \"需求\", \"follow\" as \"遵循\", and \"participated\" as \"參與\". The sentence structure is natural and the meaning is clearly conveyed.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** has some issues. It uses \"接待（能力）\" for \"handling\", which is not appropriate in this context. \"接待\" usually refers to receiving or hosting, not handling or managing. Also, \"常見\" is used for \"common\", which is not the best fit here. \"共同\" is more appropriate.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is problematic. It uses \"接待（能力）\" again, and includes Russian text \"проявляют понимание\", which is irrelevant. The use of \"交易\" for \"dealing\" is incorrect in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses \"接待（能力）\" again, which is not suitable for \"handling\". It also uses \"交易\" for \"dealing\", which is not appropriate. The phrase \"貸款人共同利益\" is awkward and should be \"貸款人的共同利益\".\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is very close to the best version. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and has a natural flow. It only slightly differs in the phrasing of the last sentence, but it is still accurate.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses \"接待\" for \"handling\", which is not appropriate. It also uses \"交易\" for \"dealing\", which is not suitable. The phrase \"以涉及的貸款人的共同利益為重\" is somewhat awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業之資金需求時，表現同理心。香港金融管理局提醒銀行在處理遇到償還問題的企業時，應遵循「香港企業困難處理方法」的指引，使參與的貸款人能夠在共同利益下協同行事。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original English text is \"# Property mortgage lending\". The junior translators have provided several translations, with the first, third, and sixth using \"物業按揭貸款\", the second and fifth using \"房屋抵押貸款\" or \"不動產抵押貸款\", and the fourth using \"不動產按揭貸款\". \nAll translations are accurate in conveying the general meaning of \"property mortgage lending\", but there are subtle differences in terminology. \"物業\" and \"不動產\" both refer to real estate or property, while \"房屋\" is more specific to buildings or houses. \"按揭\" and \"抵押\" both relate to secured loans, but \"按揭\" is more commonly used in the context of mortgages in Hong Kong and other Chinese-speaking regions.\nConsidering the context of \"property mortgage lending\", which is a general term referring to loans secured by real estate, \"物業按揭貸款\" is the most appropriate and commonly used term in this context. It is concise, clear, and widely understood in financial and legal contexts in Traditional Chinese. Therefore, \"物業按揭貸款\" is the best translation among the options provided.\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）陸續推出的多輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，加強了銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行業應對樓價急跌所帶來挑戰的能力。2023年核准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）維持在57%，相比2009年9月逆週期措施首次推出前的64%（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）維持在40%的低水平，相比2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%。\n\n7月7日，香港金融管理局（HKMA）鑑於樓價、交易量以及本地和外圍經濟環境等因素，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來，首次放寬有關措施。調整內容包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款與價值比率（LTV），以及基於按揭申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率。此外，取消了對主要收入來自香港以外地方的按揭申請人，需將適用的最高貸款與價值比率及供款與入息比率（DSR）限額降低10個百分點的要求。HKMA亦取消了當申請人的總按揭貸款超過其正常可接受的貸款與價值比率上限20個百分點時，需對適用的供款與入息比率限額實施五個百分點減幅的要求。\n\n圖1 核准新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率及供款與入息比率\n圖1 核准新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率及供款與入息比率\n圖1 核准新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率及供款與入息比率\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局採取多管齊下策略，取得顯著進展，以鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n兩項重大活動的成功，即全球金融領導人投資峰會及香港金管局與BIS的高層次會議，進一步鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生了正面的連鎖反應。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局作出協力努力，以深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括在粵港澳大灣區內對跨境理財通計劃進行提升，為債券通南向交易指定額外做市商，順利推出互換通北向交易，以及推出港元人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做市計劃。這些措施有效加強香港的門戶地位，並鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局亦在加強香港金融平台競爭力的範疇中取得良好進展，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業財務中心等。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強與海外及內地持份者的市場推廣活動，以讓他們充分了解香港金融市場的機會及其韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的「金融科技2025」策略在各個範疇均取得重大進展，包括推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數字貨幣、數據基礎設施、人才發展，以及政策和資金支持等範疇。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於9月迎來五周年。註冊數字持續增長，截至2023年底已達到13.6百萬。該系統全年平均每日成交額上升至1.25百萬筆即時交易。FPS x PromptPay跨境QR支付連結於12月與泰國銀行聯合推出，為來往兩地的人士提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及地區性中央銀行及監管組織的積極成員，香港金融管理局持續為全球維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯員的翻譯時，我們需從語法、流暢度、用詞準確性與文化適切性幾個方面進行分析。\n1. **第一譯文**：用詞基本正確，但「機構組織」略顯重複，語感稍顯生硬。此外，「貢獻於」的搭配雖可接受，但不如「為……作出貢獻」自然。\n2. **第二譯文**：語法正確，但「全球維持金融穩定」語序略顯不自然，應調整為「維持金融穩定的全球努力」。\n3. **第三譯文**：語法正確，用詞自然，結構清晰，是目前最接近理想翻譯的版本。但「作出貢獻」的語序與原文略有出入，可進一步優化。\n4. **第四譯文**：「貨幣當局」與原文「central banking」不完全對應，且「活躍成員」與「active member」語義略有差異，影響準確性。\n5. **第五譯文**：語法正確，用詞自然，並正確使用了「積極成員」與「持續為……作出貢獻」的搭配，是目前最優的版本之一。\n6. **第六譯文**：「論壇」與原文「forums」不完全對應，且「促進」與「promote」語義略有偏差，影響準確性。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「forums」正確翻譯為「組織」，而非「論壇」。\n- 使用「積極成員」而非「活躍成員」，以更貼近「active member」的語義。\n- 「持續為……作出貢獻」是較自然的搭配，應優先使用。\n- 「推動」與「promote」語義一致，應保留。\n- 「維持」與「maintain」語義一致，應保留。\n- 「多間」與「many」語義一致，應保留。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n作為多間國際及地區性中央銀行及監管組織的積極成員，香港金融管理局持續為全球維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n貫穿全年，香港金融管理局持續積極努力，加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。11月，其舉辦了第二屆全球金融領袖投資峰會。這項為期三天的活動聚集了來自世界各地的知名金融領袖，在「與複雜共存」的主題下分享他們獨特的視野。逾350名來自160間國際金融機構的參加者出席，清楚顯示全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。同年同月，香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）共同舉辦HKMA-BIS高層會議，吸引逾300名參加者，包括逾20位現任及前央行總裁。該會議凸顯了香港金融管理局與BIS以及國際央行界之間的緊密合作。\n\n內地與香港互通機制的擴展及提升，強化了香港作為內地與國際金融市場之間橋樑的角色。為便利粵港澳大灣區（GBA）內的跨境零售投資，一連串針對跨境財富管理互通（跨境WMC）機制的提升措施已推出。借助南向債券通的暢順運作，香港金融管理局指定9名額外做市商，以改善二級市場流動性並符合投資者需求。今年成功推出Swap Connect的北向交易，讓全球投資者透過香港更好地管理其內地固定收益投資組合所相關的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務在該年見證了強勁增長。香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所及清算所有限公司（HKEX）合作，於6月推出HKD-RMB雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台市場製作計劃。這有助於在香港發展更多元化的人民幣等值產品種類，並促進在香港發行及交易人民幣等值股票。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新方面亦取得重大進展，並鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。同時，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地的利益相關者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。本年度重點措施包括：\n- 推動財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術（DLT）等重點範疇的進一步應用；\n- 推進批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 在研究香港引入零售CBDC（即e-HKD）的前景方面取得進一步進展；\n- 加強推動商業數據交換（CDI）的發展；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 透過資金和政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 拓寬FPS的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，對維持香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，4項銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易存管處（HKTR）達成100%系統可用率，超越99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括北向及南向債券通對接服務，持續暢順運作。\n\nFPS 的應用在 2023 年持續增加，標誌著 FPS 達成五周年這一重大里程碑。過去五年來，FPS 的註冊數字和成交額持續增長，截至 2023 年底，註冊數字已增至 13.6 百萬，而全年平均每日成交額較 2022 年上升了 33%。除了個人對個人和商業支付持續增長外，FPS 用於繳納政府賬單、商戶支付以及為儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行賬戶充值的使用增加，也是交易量持續上升的主要驅動因素。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督六項指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並監管17間持牌儲值支付工具發行機構（SVFs），其中四間為由持牌銀行發行的SVFs。在本年度內，HKMA亦持續便利政府消費券計劃的暢順執行，協助協調與該計劃有關的相關政府第三方及為該計劃委任的SVF持牌機構，並促進雙方的對話與合作。\n\n2024年1月27日，財政司司庫局與香港金融管理局（HKMA）聯合發佈了一份有關穩定幣發行機構監管的公開諮詢文件。其後，HKMA於2024年3月12日推出了沙盒安排，針對有意在香港發行法幣掛鉤穩定幣的機構。同時，HKMA亦積極參與國際機構有關加密資產活動的工作，並緊密監測市場的發展。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局（HKMA）維持為中央銀行界積極的成員，並持續在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。現正，HKMA共同擔任巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）政策與標準小組的主席，亦擔任亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監測專家小組（至6月）以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）金融創新網絡的主席。HKMA亦擔任國際清算銀行（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體（EMEs）央行總裁會議的主席。2018年至2023年間，HKMA連續擔任東亞及太平洋央行總裁會議（EMEAP）下設金融市場工作小組的主席。\n\n香港金融管理局亦分別於五月份及七月份與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及沙特阿拉伯中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，以推動中東與亞洲之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。第六次香港－瑞士金融對話於9月25日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論涵蓋區域及本地展望與政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技及市場聯繫等範疇的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。儘管主要發達經濟體的通脹水平已從2023年的高位下跌，但仍維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在經歷了一輪進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備系統自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能已接近或達到其峰值。這一點，以及美國經濟具韌性，使投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄烏戰爭以及當年中東地區衝突的爆發，為投資市場增添了波動和不明朗因素。在這個複雜且多變的投資環境中，Exchange Fund的投資表現經歷了一些起伏。儘管如此，Exchange Fund仍成功取得了良好的投資回報。2023年，Exchange Fund錄得2,260億港元的投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n在評估各項翻譯後，可以看出「交易所基金」是較為準確且符合常見用法的翻譯。其他翻譯如「匯生基金」、「基金會」、「匯豐基金」等，雖然語法正確，但與「The Exchange Fund」的語意不完全吻合。其中「基金會」一詞在中文中通常指非營利組織，與「Fund」的金融意義有所差異。而「匯豐基金」則可能引起與「HSBC」（匯豐銀行）的混淆。因此，選擇「交易所基金」作為翻譯，不僅語意準確，也符合金融領域的常用術語。\n\n證券交易所基金的主要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯兌價值。該基金亦可能用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以便協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長轉授的權力，並在轉授權限的條件內，就證券交易所基金的運用及投資管理對財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已為外匯基金設立以下投資目標：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is accurate in terms of vocabulary and structure, correctly using the dictionary terms \"設立\" for \"set\" and \"以下\" for \"following.\" However, it omits the full name of the Exchange Fund in the second mention, which may cause confusion for readers unfamiliar with the term.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** incorrectly translates \"Exchange Fund\" as \"香港儲備基金\" (Hong Kong Reserve Fund), which is not an accurate equivalent. Additionally, it uses \"香港儲備基金管理委員會\" (Hong Kong Reserve Fund Management Committee) instead of the correct \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** misidentifies the committee as \"聯匯基金諮詢委員會\" (Linked Exchange Fund Advisory Committee), which is not the official name. It also uses \"聯匯基金\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is inaccurate.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** incorrectly translates \"Exchange Fund\" as \"證券交易所基金\" (Securities Exchange Fund), which is not the correct term. It also misplaces the phrase \"為證券交易所基金\" (for the Securities Exchange Fund), making the sentence structure awkward.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is more accurate than the fourth, correctly using \"證券交易所基金顧問委員會\" (Securities Exchange Fund Advisory Committee) and \"證券交易所基金\" (Securities Exchange Fund). However, these are still incorrect translations of \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** retains the English names \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\" and \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not ideal for a Chinese translation. It also places \"為 Exchange Fund\" at the end of the sentence, which is grammatically awkward in Chinese.\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**\nThe best approach is to use the correct official name for the committee and fund, ensuring that the dictionary terms are used accurately. The phrase \"已為 Exchange Fund 設立以下投資目標\" should be translated as \"已為外匯基金設立以下投資目標,\" using the dictionary terms \"設立\" for \"set\" and \"以下\" for \"following.\" The committee should be referred to as \"外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）\" to maintain clarity and accuracy. This translation is concise, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate.\n\n(i) 保障資本；  \n(ii) 確保在任何時候，整體貨幣基礎均充分由極高流通性且以美元等值的資產支持；  \n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的；以及  \n(iv) 受 (i) 至 (iii) 之限制，取得投資回報，以協助維持基金長期的購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n以下是對各個翻譯版本的評審與分析：\n1. **第一個翻譯**：語法上有些不自然，如「採取全面考慮」搭配不當，應為「全面考慮」或「採取……措施」。此外，「註冊到」用詞不準確，「註冊」應用於法律或官方程序，而非投資組合結構。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，如「納入」比「註冊」更符合語境，且「目標資產組合」也較自然。但「交易所基金」可能與原文「Exchange Fund」不完全對應，應視上下文而定。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：用詞準確，語句自然，「外匯基金」可能更符合「Exchange Fund」的常見翻譯，但需確認是否與原文語境一致。此外，「目標資產配置」比「目標資產組合」更常見於財務語境。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：「儲備基金」與「Exchange Fund」不完全對應，可能引起誤解。此外，「註冊於」與「註冊到」一樣，語義不準確。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：語法上有些不自然，如「採取全面考慮」與「被註冊於」搭配不當，影響整體流暢度。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：語句斷裂，用詞不連貫，如「採取 全面 考慮」與「註冊 到」之間缺乏語法連接，影響閱讀體驗。\n**改進建議**：應選擇最符合語境的詞彙，如「目標」、「法定目的」、「納入」、「投資組合結構」、「目標資產配置」等。此外，「Exchange Fund」應根據上下文選擇最合適的翻譯，如「交易所基金」或「外匯基金」，但需保持一致性。\n**最佳翻譯**：這些目標充分考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 交易所基金的投資組合分離\n審視各譯文後，發現「Portfolio segregation」的翻譯有「分離」、「分類」、「劃分」、「資產分離」、「組合分離」等不同版本。其中「分離」與「劃分」較接近原意，但「分類」與「資產分離」可能產生歧義。考慮到「segregation」在金融語境中常指「分離」或「劃分」，而「investment portfolio」應譯為「投資組合」，因此「圖 1 交易所基金的投資組合分離」最為準確且符合語境。此外，「Exchange Fund」應譯為「交易所基金」，而非「聯匯基金」，因此第三譯文有誤。最終選用第六譯文，因其語法正確且用詞準確。\n\n廣義而言，發行基金擁有兩大資產組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有流通性高之美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，提供全面支持予貨幣基礎。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體之債券及股權市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力為目標。\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩個主要投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有流動性極高的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全面支持。IP主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券和股票市場，旨在保障其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩大投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有極高流通性的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全面支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股票市場，旨在保障資產價值及其長期購買力。\n總體而言，外匯基金擁有兩項主要的投資組合：支持性投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP 持有極高流通性的美元資產，主要提供對貨幣基地全面支持，這符合按貨幣券制度的規定。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券和股本市場，旨在保障其資產的價值和長期購買力量。\n廣義而言，發行基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合（BP）持有極高流通性美元資產，以提供全面支持予貨幣基礎，這是由於貨幣聯繫匯率制度的規定。投資組合（IP）主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股票市場，以期保障資產價值及維持其長期購買力量。\n廣義而言，外匯基金主要持有兩項投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有極高流通性高的美元資產，以提供全面支持貨幣基礎，符合聯繫匯率制度的要求。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展機構成員經濟體的債券和股權市場，旨在保障其資產的價值和長期購買力量。\n各譯文在整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的內容，但在語法、用詞、語感及專業性方面仍有改進空間。以下為各譯文的評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，符合正式文件的語感。但「維持資產價值及長期購買力為目標」語序略顯生硬，可調整為「以維持資產價值及長期購買力為目標」。\n2. **第二譯文**：語句流暢，專業性強，用詞準確。但「經濟合作與發展組織」應為「經濟合作與發展組織」，而非「機構」。\n3. **第三譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「經濟合作及發展組織」與「經濟合作與發展組織」略有差異，應統一為「經濟合作與發展組織」。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句較為生硬，「支持性投資組合」與「投資組合」重複，且「貨幣券制度」與原文「Currency Board arrangements」不符，應為「貨幣局制度」。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「貨幣聯繫匯率制度」與原文「Currency Board arrangements」不符，應為「貨幣局制度」。\n6. **第六譯文**：語句通順，但「極高流通性高的美元資產」語序重複，應為「極高流通性的美元資產」；「經濟合作暨發展機構」與原文「Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development」不符，應為「經濟合作與發展組織」。\n**改進方向**：\n- 確保所有專業術語與詞典一致，如「Currency Board arrangements」應譯為「貨幣局制度」。\n- 統一「經濟合作與發展組織」的譯法，避免使用「機構」。\n- 調整語序，使語句更自然流暢。\n- 避免重複用詞，如「投資組合」與「支持性投資組合」。\n廣義而言，發行基金擁有兩大資產組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有流通性高之美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，提供全面支持予貨幣基礎。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體之債券及股權市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力為目標。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別一起釐定，受審慎風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略的限制。\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別一起釐定，受審慎風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略的限制。\n\n策略投資組合於2007年建立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為交易所基金的策略目的購入。由於其獨特性質，策略投資組合並未納入基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與外匯基金的投資安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的資金存放。利率一般與投資組合1的表現掛鈎。一個主要的個別例子是未來基金2，其利率根據投資組合與長期增長計劃（LTGP）的回報，並按照投資組合比例掛鈎。未來基金2在2023年，投資組合1與長期增長計劃之間的投資組合比例約為35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n香港儲備基金的投資過程由兩種資產配置決策所支持：戰略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表基於香港儲備基金投資目標的長期資產配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會戰術性配置以爭取超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術偏差」。雖然基準與循跡誤差3的限額是由財政司長與儲備基金管理委員會磋商後釐定，但戰術性決策及戰術偏差的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權力下設立。在戰術偏差容許範圍內，投資組合經理可能管理頭寸以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責管理外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理功能。外匯基金投資辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整體BP及部分IP。由內部管理的IP部分包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及不同衍生工具對沖組合，用以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Use of external managers,\" and the dictionary specifies that \"use\" must be translated as \"使用.\" All junior translators have correctly used \"使用\" for \"use,\" which is a strength.\nHowever, the term \"external managers\" is the key phrase that requires careful translation. The dictionary does not provide a direct translation for \"external managers,\" so the junior translators have used their own interpretations. The options provided by the junior translators include:\n1. **外部經理人** – This is a natural and commonly used term in Traditional Chinese for \"external managers\" or \"outside managers,\" particularly in corporate or financial contexts.\n2. **外部管理員** – This term is more commonly used for \"external administrator\" or \"external staff member,\" which may not be the best fit for \"managers.\"\n3. **外部管理人員** – This is a more general term for \"external personnel\" or \"external staff,\" which is broader than \"managers.\"\n4. **外部經理** – This is a more concise version of \"外部經理人,\" and is also acceptable, though slightly less formal.\nAmong these, **外部經理人** is the most precise and natural translation for \"external managers\" in a professional or corporate context. It is concise, clear, and widely understood in business settings.\n**Improvements:**\n- The use of **#** at the beginning of the translation is consistent with the original English format, so it should be retained.\n- The term **外部經理人** is the most appropriate and natural choice for \"external managers.\"\n- The translations that use **外部管理員** or **外部管理人員** are less precise and may lead to ambiguity or misinterpretation in a professional context.\n**Final Translation:**\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦僱用外部基金管理人管理約29%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部基金管理人的目的，在於汲取市場上可用的最高投資專門知識，以獲取可持續回報，同時亦汲取多元化且互補的投資方式，並善用外部市場見解及投資領域的專門知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本，以及扣繳稅及其他稅項。此項支出主要由市場因素釐定，可能每年有所不同。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯的譯文時，我們需從語法、用詞、語感與文化適切性等多方面進行審視。首先，所有譯文都正確使用了詞彙表中指定的對應詞，如「relating」對應「相關」、「primarily」對應「主要」、「fluctuate」對應「不同」、「determined」對應「釐定」、「year」對應「年」等，這一點值得肯定。\n然而，各譯文在語感與語法上仍存在一些差異。例如，第一譯文使用「且可能每年有所不同」，語感自然，但「有所不同」略顯口語化；第二譯文使用「可能每年有所不同」，語感更正式；第三譯文的「可能不同於年年」語感較為生硬，不符合中文表達習慣；第四譯文的「這筆支出」與「每年不同」語感較為口語；第五譯文的「扣繳及其他稅費」與「可能每年不同」語感自然；第六譯文的「托管費用」與「扣留稅」用詞略顯不一致。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度與專業性，最佳的譯文應使用較正式且符合財務語境的詞彙，如「基金管理費」、「保管費」、「交易成本」、「扣繳稅」、「其他稅項」等，並採用「主要由市場因素釐定」與「可能每年有所不同」的表達方式，使整體語句流暢、專業且符合中文語法習慣。因此，最終的譯文在保留所有正確詞彙的基礎上，進一步優化語感與語法，使整體表達更為自然與專業。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規是企業經營中不可或缺的一環，主要目的是識別、評估和控制可能對企業造成負面影響的風險，並確保企業在運作過程中遵循相關法律法規及內部政策。風險管理涵蓋財務、運營、市場、法務等多個層面，而合規則強調企業在各項業務活動中必須遵守的法規與道德標準。有效的風險管理與合規機制不僅能降低潛在損失，也能提升企業的信譽與長期競爭力。\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好風險管理日益重要。香港金融管理局為其內部及對外管理的投資組合設定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並確保已建立妥善的風險監察及合規系統。為推行有效的風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設立三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）會定期監察。風險管理過程提供了一個穩健的架構，支持香港金融管理局的戰略規劃及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 負責任的投資\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English term is \"Responsible investment,\" which is a commonly used phrase in the fields of finance and ethics. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are close in meaning but differ slightly in phrasing and punctuation.\n1. **# 負責任的投資** – This translation uses the phrase \"負責任的\" (responsible) followed by \"投資\" (investment), which is a direct and accurate translation. The use of the possessive particle \"的\" makes the phrase more natural in Traditional Chinese, clearly indicating that the investment is responsible.\n2. **# 責任投資** – This is a more concise version, omitting the possessive particle \"的.\" While it is still understandable, it may be slightly less natural in formal or professional contexts, where the possessive particle is often used to clarify the relationship between the adjective and noun.\n3. **# 責任投資** – This is identical to the second translation and suffers from the same potential issue of being slightly less natural in formal contexts.\n4. **負責任投資** – This version omits both the possessive particle and the punctuation mark. While it is still understandable, it is less conventional in formal writing and may appear more like a title or heading than a full phrase.\n5. **責任投資** – This is the same as the second and third translations and shares the same potential issue of being slightly less natural in formal contexts.\n6. **責任投資** – This is identical to the fifth translation and suffers from the same potential issue.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe most natural and conventional translation in formal or professional contexts would be **# 負責任的投資**, as it uses the possessive particle \"的\" to clearly indicate the relationship between the adjective and noun. This makes the phrase more fluent and appropriate for use in documents, reports, or discussions related to finance and ethics.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of \"Responsible investment\" into Traditional Chinese is **# 負責任的投資**.\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）相信，適當強調責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，可協助更好地實現 Exchange Fund 的投資目標，同時減低與其基礎投資相關的環境、社會及治理（ESG）事宜所帶來的風險。為積極支持責任投資實踐，HKMA 已將 ESG 因素併入 Exchange Fund 的投資流程，其指導性原則為，若 ESG 投資的長期風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮 ESG 投資。如欲了解更多有關 HKMA 責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中的「責任投資」章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is \"# Performance of the Exchange Fund.\" The term \"Exchange Fund\" is critical to the translation, as it refers to a specific financial entity. The dictionary is empty, so we must rely on standard translations and contextual understanding.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 外匯基金的表現**  \n   - \"外匯基金\" translates to \"foreign exchange fund,\" which is a plausible interpretation of \"Exchange Fund.\" However, \"外匯\" is more commonly used in the context of foreign exchange reserves or foreign currency, not necessarily an \"Exchange Fund\" as a specific entity. This translation is close but may not be the most precise.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: # 交易所基金表現**  \n   - \"交易所基金\" translates to \"exchange-traded fund\" (ETF), which is a type of investment fund traded on stock exchanges. This is a misinterpretation of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not the same as an ETF. This translation is incorrect in context.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 交換基金的表現**  \n   - \"交換基金\" translates to \"exchange fund,\" which is a direct translation. However, \"交換\" is more commonly used in the context of swapping or exchanging, not in financial terminology. This translation is grammatically correct but may not be the most natural or commonly used term in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: # 聯匯基金表現**  \n   - \"聯匯基金\" translates to \"linked exchange fund,\" which is not a standard term and may be confusing. This translation is not accurate and introduces ambiguity.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: # 基金的表現**  \n   - \"基金的表現\" translates to \"performance of the fund,\" which is too generic and omits the specific term \"Exchange Fund.\" This translation lacks specificity and is not suitable for the title.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: # 交易所基金表現**  \n   - This is the same as the second junior translator's translation and is therefore also incorrect, as it refers to an ETF rather than an \"Exchange Fund.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nGiven the context and the need for precision, the most appropriate translation of \"Exchange Fund\" is \"交易所基金.\" While this term is more commonly associated with ETFs, in the absence of a specific dictionary entry, it is the closest and most commonly used term in financial contexts. The title \"# 交易所基金表現\" is the most accurate and natural translation among the provided options. It maintains the structure of the original title and uses a term that is widely understood in financial discussions.\n\n# 2023年金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年更廣泛層面呈現向上趨勢。標普500指數全年上升24%，尤其是在第四季，市場開始預期比預期更快的減息。\n\n在債券市場中，收益率維持在高水平，10年期美國國債收益率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨著市場對央行貨幣政策預期的改變，債券收益率在年底回落，同時債券價格逐步上漲。\n\n在貨幣市場中，美元對主要貨幣的表現不一。其中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日圓和人民幣則貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n表1 2023年市場回報率\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is \"# Performance of the Exchange Fund.\" The term \"Exchange Fund\" is critical to the translation, as it refers to a specific financial entity.

The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.\n\nYoung visitors learn about the design of banknotes in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre\n\nGuided tour of the Information Centre for kindergarten students\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nSince 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme that reaches out to the community to raise public awareness of its work. To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

公司功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the task is to translate it into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese. The dictionary is empty, so no specific terms need to be translated using predefined equivalents. However, the junior translators have provided several variations, and a critical evaluation is necessary.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"企業功能\" is appropriate, as \"企業\" means \"corporate\" or \"company,\" and \"功能\" means \"functions.\" The hashtag is preserved, which is suitable for headings or titles.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing between the hashtag and the text is inconsistent with standard Chinese formatting, which typically uses no space after the hashtag.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a clean and concise translation. It accurately reflects the meaning of \"Corporate Functions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It omits the hashtag, which may be important if the original text is intended as a heading or title.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is similar to the first translation, with the hashtag included.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing between the hashtag and the text is inconsistent with standard Chinese formatting.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: 企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"職能\" is a more formal and precise term for \"functions\" in a corporate or organizational context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** While \"職能\" is a valid translation, it may be less commonly used than \"功能\" in general contexts, and the hashtag is omitted.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: #企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** This version includes the hashtag and uses \"職能,\" which is a more formal and precise term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing between the hashtag and the text is inconsistent with standard Chinese formatting.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: # 公司職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"公司\" is a direct translation of \"corporate\" or \"company,\" and \"職能\" is a precise term for \"functions.\" The hashtag is included.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing between the hashtag and the text is inconsistent with standard Chinese formatting.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and follow standard Chinese formatting. \"公司功能\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in Chinese business contexts. It is more general and widely understood than \"職能,\" which is more formal and specific. Including the hashtag is appropriate if the original text is intended as a heading or title. Proper spacing after the hashtag is also important for consistency and readability.\nTherefore, the improved translation is: **# 公司功能**.\n\n企業職能以高透明度、問責性、效率及專業水平支持香港金融管理局（HKMA）的運作。為推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解，香港金融管理局積極透過傳統及社交媒體、HKMA網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社區及市場參與者進行溝通。\n\n在內部，香港金融管理局正努力建立一支靈活應變且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升其數字化能力，以便適應變化，確保其政策和措施能更有效地落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體的使用\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2023年，香港金融管理局舉辦或參與了188場開放傳媒活動，包括11場記者會、六場簡報會、15場站立式訪問及156項其他公眾活動。全年期間，亦安排了另外25場傳媒訪問，發佈583份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提高本地、內地及外國媒體對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的意識，舉辦了新聞發佈會和媒體簡報會。內容包括反詐騙行動、中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）及穩定幣。\n\n媒體代表積極參與香港金融管理局於2023年舉辦的活動，尤其是第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。這項為期三天的活動在本地、內地及國際媒體上產生了超過2,000則正面、真實的新聞報導。\n\n葉國華先生，首席執行官，於香港金融科技週2023的媒體發言會上致辭。\n\n尤智明先生，行政總裁，在全球金融領導人投資峰會上主持媒體發言會。\n\n陳俊宇先生（右起第一人），副行政長官，於反詐騙消費者保護公約活動中主持分享環節。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"先生\" for \"Mr\" and \"環節\" for \"session\". The structure is clear and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"由右至左第一個\" is incorrect; the original says \"first from right\", which should be \"右起第一人\" or \"由右至左第一個\" is ambiguous and not standard in Chinese.\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"反詐騙消費者保護公約活動\" is appropriate and natural.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"先生\" and \"環節\" correctly. The term \"反詐騙消費者保護憲章活動\" is accurate.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"副總督\" is incorrect; the correct title is \"副行政長官\". \"憲章\" is not the best match for \"Charter\" in this context; \"公約\" is more appropriate.\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"憲章\" is more commonly used in legal or formal documents, but \"公約\" is more suitable for a consumer protection charter.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"先生\" and \"環節\" correctly.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"阮裕安\" is not the correct transliteration of \"Arthur Yuen\". \"副行政總裁\" is incorrect; the correct title is \"副行政長官\".\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"約章\" is not a standard term for \"Charter\" in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"先生\" and \"環節\" correctly. The term \"防騙消費者保護憲章\" is close to the intended meaning.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"執行副總裁\" is incorrect; the correct title is \"副行政長官\". \"防騙\" is slightly less formal than \"反詐騙\".\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"憲章\" is acceptable but \"公約\" is more natural in this context.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"先生\" and \"環節\" correctly. The structure is clear and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"阮國強\" is not the correct transliteration of \"Arthur Yuen\". \"副行政總裁\" is incorrect; the correct title is \"副行政長官\".\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"公約\" is appropriate for \"Charter\".\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"先生\" and \"環節\" correctly. The structure is clear and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"反詐騙消費者保護宣誓活動\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"公約活動\".\n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"宣誓活動\" is not appropriate for a consumer protection charter event.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the correct transliteration of \"Arthur Yuen\" as \"陳俊宇先生\", the correct title \"副行政長官\", and the appropriate term \"反詐騙消費者保護公約活動\". The phrase \"右起第一人\" is the most natural and accurate way to express \"first from right\". The term \"環節\" is correctly used for \"session\". The final translation should be concise, natural, and culturally appropriate.\n\nHoward Lee 先生（中間），副行政長官，主持有關 e-HKD 試點計劃第一階段報告的媒體簡報會。\n\n陳達理先生（左起第一人），副行政總裁，在2023年財政市場峰會上主持一場委員會討論。\n\n創意社交媒體內容有助上調公眾對香港金融管理局倡議及其他種類主題的意識。\n\n為更有效地與公眾互動，香港金融管理局運營六個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、微信、X（前稱Twitter）及YouTube），這些平台統稱擁有超過150,000名追蹤者。香港金融管理局的主要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領導人投資峰會，均會在其社交媒體平台上進行現場直播，以提升公眾及業界的參與度。香港金融管理局亦會開發具創意的社交媒體內容，以提升公眾對各類主題及倡議的意識。近期內容涵蓋的主題包括消費者保護及防詐騙、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及香港金融管理局的重大活動。\n為更有效地與公眾互動，香港金融管理局運營六個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、微信、X（前稱Twitter）及YouTube），這些平台統稱擁有超過150,000名追蹤者。香港金融管理局的主要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領導人投資峰會，均會在其社交媒體平台上進行現場直播，以提升公眾及業界的參與度。香港金融管理局亦會開發具創意的社交媒體內容，以提升公眾對各類主題及倡議的意識。近期內容涵蓋的主題包括消費者保護及防詐騙、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及香港金融管理局的重大活動。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n香港金融管理局的公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效渠道，以更好地了解金管局的主要職能及運作情況。\n\n在評估六位初級翻譯的版本後，可以看出他們在整體語意傳達上都相當準確，並正確使用了詞彙表中指定的翻譯。然而，各版本在語氣、語法、用詞選擇及語句流暢度上仍有改進空間。\n首先，「Public Enquiry Service」的翻譯有「公眾查詢服務」、「公共查詢服務」等不同版本，其中「公眾查詢服務」更符合常見官方機構名稱的用法，語氣較正式且自然。\n其次，「enquiries」均正確翻譯為「查詢」，但「宗」比「個」更常用於正式文件中，如「處理了9,565宗查詢」更符合語境。\n再者，「-related」均正確翻譯為「相關」，但語法上應與「與……相關」搭配使用，如「與消費者銀行業務相關」比「消費者銀行業務相關」更自然。\n「common」均正確翻譯為「常見」，但語序上「一些常見的查詢主題」比「一些常見查詢的主題」更符合中文語法。\n此外，「Coin Collection Programme」有「紀念銀幣收藏計劃」、「硬幣收藏計劃」、「硬幣收集計劃」等不同翻譯，其中「硬幣收藏計劃」較為簡潔明確，符合官方文件的語氣。\n「Faster Payment System」有「快速支付系統」、「即時支付系統」、「更快支付系統」等不同翻譯，其中「快速支付系統」最常見且符合語境。\n綜合以上觀察，最佳翻譯應在語氣正式、語法正確、用詞精準、語句流暢的基礎上，選擇最符合官方文件風格的詞彙與語序。\n2023年，公眾查詢服務共處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約有一半的查詢與消費者銀行業務問題、銀行政策及規則、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣和硬幣相關。一些常見的查詢主題包括銀行產品及服務、硬幣收藏計劃、零售債券發行計劃、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及快速支付系統。\n\n圖1列明自2020年起公共查詢服務收到的查詢數字，而圖2則規定2023年收到查詢的性質分類。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯員的翻譯時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性，以及是否正確使用詞彙表中指定的翻譯。\n1. **第一譯文**：語法正確，但「規定」用於「provides」顯得不自然，「規定」通常用於「prescribe」或「regulate」，而非「provide」。此外，「詳細分類」雖正確，但語氣略顯冗長。\n2. **第二譯文**：語法正確，用詞較為自然，「分佈」比「分類」更貼近「breakdown」的語意，但「規定」仍不適合「provides」。\n3. **第三譯文**：重複使用「公共查詢」，語句略顯累贅，且「規定」同樣不適合「provides」。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句較長，結構複雜，「有關」一詞略顯冗餘，且「規定」仍不適合「provides」。\n5. **第五譯文**：將「Public Enquiry Service」翻譯為「公共服務部門」，與原文不符，應為「公共查詢服務」。此外，「規定」仍不適合「provides」。\n6. **第六譯文**：語法正確，用詞自然，且正確使用了「列明」、「收到」、「查詢數字」、「規定」、「性質分類」等詞彙，符合詞彙表要求，語句流暢，是最接近最佳翻譯的版本。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「provides」正確翻譯為「規定」，雖然語感上略顯生硬，但根據詞彙表要求，必須使用。\n- 避免重複用詞，如「公共查詢」。\n- 簡化語句結構，使語意更清晰。\n- 確保「Chart」翻譯為「圖」，並使用數字「1」、「2」而非「一」、「二」，以符合正式文件的格式。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n圖1列明自2020年起公共查詢服務收到的查詢數字，而圖2則規定2023年收到查詢的性質分類。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"Chart 1 Total number of public enquiries.\" The dictionary provides specific translations for \"Chart\" (圖), \"number\" (數字), and \"enquiries\" (查詢). The goal is to ensure that these terms are translated exactly as specified, while maintaining fluency and naturalness in Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖\" for \"Chart,\" \"公眾查詢\" for \"public enquiries,\" and \"總數\" for \"total number.\" The phrase is fluent and natural.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"圖1 總數字公眾查詢\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct terms from the dictionary.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"總數字公眾查詢\" is awkward and unnatural. The word order is incorrect, making the meaning unclear.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數字\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"總數字\" is not a standard phrase in Chinese. \"總數\" is the correct term for \"total number.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"圖1 公眾查詢總數字\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the third, correct dictionary terms.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue with \"總數字\" being unnatural.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"圖 1 公共查詢總數\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"總數\" correctly.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"公共查詢\" is not the best translation for \"public enquiries.\" \"公眾查詢\" is more natural and commonly used in this context.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"圖1 公眾查詢總數\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of all dictionary terms and natural word order.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct dictionary terms and maintain natural, fluent Chinese. \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數\" (Translation 1 and 6) is the most accurate and natural. It uses \"圖\" for \"Chart,\" \"公眾查詢\" for \"public enquiries,\" and \"總數\" for \"total number.\" The word order is correct and the phrase is commonly used in formal contexts such as charts and reports.\n**Improved Translation:**\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖2 2023年收到查詢的性質\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a title for a chart: \"Chart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023.\" The goal is to translate this title into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese while adhering to the provided dictionary.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1 and 2:** \"圖2 2023年收到的查詢性質\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms (\"圖\" for \"Chart,\" \"收到\" for \"received,\" \"查詢\" for \"enquiries,\" \"性質\" for \"nature\").  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"收到的查詢性質\" may be slightly awkward in structure. It implies \"the nature of received inquiries,\" which is grammatically correct but not the most natural phrasing in Chinese.\n2. **Translation 3, 4, 5:** \"圖2 2023年收到查詢的性質\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure \"收到查詢的性質\" is more natural and commonly used in titles or headings. It reads as \"the nature of inquiries received in 2023.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong and fluent translation.\n3. **Translation 6:** \"圖 2 收到之查詢性質，2023年。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the classical particle \"之\" for a more formal tone, which may be appropriate in certain contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The placement of \"2023年\" at the end is less conventional for a chart title. Typically, the year is placed immediately after the time reference, not at the end of the sentence.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most natural and fluent translation would be \"圖2 2023年收到查詢的性質.\" This version uses the correct dictionary terms and follows a structure that is commonly used in titles and headings in Chinese. It clearly conveys the meaning of the original English title without unnecessary complexity or awkward phrasing. The placement of the year \"2023年\" directly after the time reference is also more conventional in such contexts.\n**Final Translation:**\n圖2 2023年收到查詢的性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n在這六份翻譯中，各有其優點與不足。整體而言，翻譯的語法與結構大致正確，但存在一些用詞不準確、語序不自然、以及與原文語意不完全契合的問題。\n首先，「published」在字典中對應「載有」，但實際上「published」應翻譯為「發佈」或「刊發」，而「載有」意為「包含」，與原文語意不符。多數翻譯正確使用了「發佈」或「刊發」，但第二位翻譯使用了「載有」，這與字典中的選項不符，也與語意不符。\n其次，「making」在字典中對應「制定」，但原文中「Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations」應翻譯為「非營利及慈善機構」，而非「非營利制定及慈善機構」，因此「making」在此處應忽略，不需翻譯。\n再者，「large」在字典中對應「大量」，但原文中「Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large)」應翻譯為「公營部門\/非營利（大型）」，因此「large」應翻譯為「大型」，而非「大量」。\n此外，「award」在字典中對應「頒發」，但原文中「received a Gold Award」應翻譯為「獲得金獎」，而非「收到頒發」，因此「award」在此處應翻譯為「獎項」或「獎」，而非「頒發」。\n最後，翻譯的語序與語感方面，第四位翻譯較為自然，語句流暢，符合中文表達習慣，但仍有改進空間。\n基於以上分析，最佳翻譯應正確使用字典中的詞彙，語序自然，語意準確，並符合中文表達習慣。\n在該年度內，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMA）發佈了其《2022年度報告》，連同其首份獨立的《2022年可持續發展報告》。《2022年度報告》在香港管理協會2023年度最佳年度報告頒獎典禮的「非營利及慈善機構」類別中獲得金獎，為該類別中的最高排名。與此同時，《2022年可持續發展報告》在香港會計師公會2023年度最佳企業管治及ESG獎項的「公營部門\/非營利（大型）」類別中獲得了ESG獎項。\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局發表了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》及四期《季度通訊》，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。香港金融管理局亦發表了十四篇inSight1文章，介紹主要新政策及措施，並討論重要議題。\n\n# 公司網站與企業網站在語意上非常接近，皆可用於指稱企業的官方網站。然而，「公司」一詞較常用於指稱具體的法人實體，而「企業」則較偏向於指稱經營活動或商業組織，語感上稍顯抽象。在網站標題中，使用「公司網站」會更直接明確，也更符合常見的用法。\n此外，部分翻譯在格式上加入了「#」符號，這在網站標題中並不常見，除非是用於標籤或標題標示，否則建議省略。\n基於上述考量，「公司網站」為最自然且符合常見用法的翻譯。\n公司網站\n\n香港金融管理局的官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有近六萬頁以英文、傳統中文及簡體中文書寫的內容，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。該網站載有根據《銀行條例》（BO）第20章維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券從業員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起透過開放應用程式編程介面（Open API），分階段在其網站上釋出財務數據及重要資訊。截至2023年底，香港金融管理局已在網站上開放了175組開放式API，符合其預定的時間表。\n\n香港金融管理局的開放API門戶：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is: \"The HKMA’s Open API portal:\"\nThe dictionary specifies that \"open\" must be translated as \"開放\" and the apostrophe (’) must be omitted.\n**Evaluation of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金融管理局的開放API入口網站：\"  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"開放\" for \"open\" and accurately translates \"portal\" as \"入口網站.\"  \n   - Weakness: \"入口網站\" is slightly more verbose than \"門戶,\" which is a more direct and commonly used term for \"portal\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金管局的開放API 平台：\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"開放\" correctly and \"平台\" (platform) is a valid translation.  \n   - Weakness: \"平台\" is more general and less specific than \"門戶\" or \"入口網站\" for \"portal,\" which implies a specific access point.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金融管理局開放API門戶：\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"開放\" and \"門戶\" correctly.  \n   - Weakness: Missing the possessive particle \"的\" after \"管理局,\" which is needed for grammatical correctness in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金融管理局的開放API門戶：\"  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"開放\" and \"門戶,\" and includes the possessive particle \"的.\"  \n   - Weakness: None. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金管局的開放API入口網站：\"  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"開放\" and \"入口網站.\"  \n   - Weakness: \"入口網站\" is slightly more verbose than \"門戶,\" which is more concise and commonly used for \"portal.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金融管理局開放API門戶：\"  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"開放\" and \"門戶.\"  \n   - Weakness: Missing the possessive particle \"的\" after \"管理局,\" which is needed for grammatical correctness.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"開放\" for \"open\" and \"門戶\" for \"portal,\" as these are the most direct and commonly used terms in this context. Additionally, the possessive particle \"的\" should be included after \"管理局\" to indicate possession. Based on this, the fourth junior translator's version is the most accurate and fluent:  \n**\"香港金融管理局的開放API門戶：\"**  \nThis translation is grammatically correct, concise, and uses the most appropriate terms for the context.\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於兩國際金融中心55樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心，設有展覽館及圖書館，旨在向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識。互動展覽館提供香港金融管理局工作的概述，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，連同對研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務有幫助的資訊和展品。\n\n在這一年中，資訊中心接待了超過31,000名訪客，並為學校及其他小組舉辦了超過480場以…為指引的導覽。\n\n圖書館位於展覽館旁，專責收藏逾26,000本關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行題目之書籍、期刊及其他出版物。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20章的規定，維持AIs及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及AIs證券人員的登記冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n年輕訪客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習紙幣設計。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕遊客在資訊中心導賞導覽中學習香港紙幣的設計\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"年輕\" for \"young,\" \"學習\" for \"learn,\" and \"導賞\" for \"tour.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"導賞導覽\" is redundant; \"導賞\" alone suffices. Also, \"資訊中心\" should be \"資訊中心\" (correct), but \"香港紙幣\" is slightly awkward; \"紙幣\" is better than \"紙鈔\" in this context.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕訪客在資訊中心的導賞團中學習香港紙幣的設計。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"年輕\" and \"學習\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"導賞團\" is not a standard term; \"導賞\" alone is more natural. \"香港紙幣\" is slightly awkward.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕的遊客在香港資訊中心的導賞活動中學習鈔票的設計，以…為指引。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"年輕\" and \"導賞\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"以…為指引\" is included unnecessarily and disrupts the sentence flow. \"鈔票\" is less common than \"紙幣\" in this context.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕的訪客在香港資訊中心的導賞活動中學習紙幣的設計。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"年輕\" and \"紙幣\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"導賞活動\" is slightly wordy; \"導賞\" alone is sufficient.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕遊客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習了關於紙鈔設計的知識。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"年輕\" and \"紙鈔\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"學習了關於紙鈔設計的知識\" is overly wordy and less direct than \"學習紙幣設計.\"  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"年輕訪客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習紙幣設計。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"年輕\" and \"紙幣\" correctly. \"導賞\" is used appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong, concise translation.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nBased on the above review, the best translation is a refined version of the sixth junior translator’s work, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and natural flow in Traditional Chinese. The term \"導賞\" is used correctly, and \"紙幣\" is the most natural term for \"banknotes\" in this context. The sentence structure is fluent and adheres to the dictionary requirements.\n\n為幼稚園學生提供的資訊中心導賞\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注語法正確性、語意清晰度、語序自然度以及是否符合中文表達習慣。首先，根據詞典要求，「Guided」應翻譯為「以…為指引」，「tour」應為「導賞」，「students」應為「學生」。所有翻譯版本都正確使用了這些詞彙，因此在詞彙選擇上無誤。\n接下來分析語序與語意。第一個翻譯「以…為指引的導賞，針對幼稚園學生」語序較為生硬，「針對」一詞在中文中較少用於此類描述，語感不夠自然。第二個翻譯「以…為指引的導賞，為幼稚園學生」語序與第一個相似，但將「針對」改為「為」，語意稍有改善，但仍顯得不夠流暢。\n第三個翻譯「為幼稚園學生提供的資訊中心導賞」語序自然，語意清晰，將「資訊中心」作為導賞的主題，語感較佳。第四個翻譯「以…為指引的資訊中心導賞，針對幼稚園學生」語序與第一個相似，但加入了「資訊中心」，使語意更明確，但「針對」一詞仍顯生硬。\n第五個翻譯「幼稚園學生導賞資訊中心」語序混亂，語意不清，未能正確傳達「導賞」的主體與對象。第六個翻譯「以資訊中心為指引的幼稚園學生導賞」語序錯誤，將「資訊中心」誤作為「指引」的來源，與原意不符。\n綜合考量語序、語意與語感，第三個翻譯「為幼稚園學生提供的資訊中心導賞」最為自然，語意清晰，符合中文表達習慣。因此，我們在保留其語序與語意的基礎上，進行微調，使語句更為流暢，最終翻譯為「為幼稚園學生提供的資訊中心導賞」。\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局一直推行一個公眾教育計劃，向社區推廣其工作，以提高公眾對其工作的意識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與了該公眾教育計劃。2023年，為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。研討會的主題包括香港金融管理局的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融，以及銀行業的職業機會。\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局一直推行一個公眾教育計劃，向社區推廣其工作，以提高公眾對其工作的意識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與了該公眾教育計劃。2023年，為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。研討會的主題包括香港金融管理局的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融，以及銀行業的職業機會。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力教育及與公眾溝通，提高公眾對如何成為聰明及負責任的金融消費者之認識。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙及信用卡詐騙的上升，香港金融管理局持續透過不同媒體提醒公眾提高警覺。在推出《反詐騙消費者保護守則》後，香港金融管理局亦推出了一項全新的意識提升運動，強調銀行及主要商戶已承諾不會透過即時電子訊息傳送超連結，要求提供個人及信用卡資料。香港金融管理局亦透過電台及社交媒體渠道傳達有關信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同支付選項（包括「Buy Now, Pay Later」產品）的智慧提示。\n\n一個以「保障您的個人數位鎖匙；提防詐騙連結！」為主題的新短片及動畫，內容包含食人植物與動物陷阱。\n\n跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒公眾不要點擊可疑連結。\n\n動畫短片用以推動易來思。\n\n為支持環境，並汲取金融服務領域的技術推進，香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過社交媒體和電台宣傳，鼓勵公眾在農曆新年期間發放電子利是（e-laisees），並考慮使用良好如新的紙幣作為實體利是。\n\n香港金融管理局亦旨在提升公眾對金融業的了解，並提高年輕人對修讀金融業事業的興趣，從而擴大香港金融業的人才儲備。鑑於其較早推出的短片系列「中環人才四面睇」獲得正面回應，香港金融管理局推出新短片系列「金融特工隊：開拓新視野」，內容介紹金融業的四項成長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。該短片系列運用電腦圖像及動畫，展示資深市場從業員監管年輕人才，協助他們處理日常工作的挑戰，並以輕鬆方式介紹業內的職業機會及前景。\n\n一個名為「金融特種兵：開創全新視野」的短片系列，旨在讓年輕一代緊貼金融領域的職業機會。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性、文化適應性，以及是否正確使用詞彙表中指定的翻譯。\n1. **第一個翻譯**正確使用了詞彙表中的「短片」、「一連串」、「保持」、「緊貼」、「事業」，語句結構也較為自然，但「金融領域的事業機會」略顯生硬，可優化為「職業機會」更符合語境。\n2. **第二個翻譯**保留了英文標題，未進行翻譯，不符合翻譯要求。此外，「對金融事業機會的緊貼」語序不自然，應調整語序以提高流暢度。\n3. **第三個翻譯**翻譯了標題，並使用了「開拓新視野」，語意準確，但「製作」一詞略顯冗餘，可簡化為「旨在讓年輕一代緊貼金融事業的發展機會」更為流暢。\n4. **第四個翻譯**與第一個相似，但保留了英文標題，未翻譯，不符合翻譯要求。\n5. **第五個翻譯**翻譯了標題，並使用了「財務特種部隊」，語意準確，但「就業機會」與原文「career opportunities」語意略有偏差，應使用「職業機會」更為貼切。\n6. **第六個翻譯**正確使用了詞彙表中的詞語，但「財務事業的就業機會」語意不夠精準，應使用「職業機會」更符合原文語境。\n**總結與改進：**  \n最佳翻譯應正確使用詞彙表中指定的詞語，翻譯標題為「金融特種兵：開創全新視野」，並使用「職業機會」替代「事業機會」或「就業機會」，以更準確傳達「career opportunities」的語意。此外，語句結構應自然流暢，避免冗餘，並確保語序符合中文語法習慣。最終翻譯應為：「一個名為『金融特種兵：開創全新視野』的短片系列，旨在讓年輕一代緊貼金融領域的職業機會。」\n\n來自不同範疇的導師與學生分享他們的專門知識和經驗\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有六個翻譯版本都正確使用了詞彙表中的對應詞彙，包括「範疇」、「專門知識」、「學生」、「經驗」和「不同」，這一點值得肯定。然而，從語法流暢度、語序自然度以及語意完整性的角度來看，各版本之間存在一些差異。\n第一個翻譯版本「來自不同範疇的導師與學生分享他們的專門知識和經驗」語序自然，語意完整，符合中文表達習慣，是目前最優的版本之一。\n第二個翻譯版本「來自不同範疇的導師，分享他們的專門知識和經驗給學生。」雖然語法正確，但語序略顯生硬，「給學生」的語序在中文中不如「與學生分享」自然。\n第三個翻譯版本「來自不同範疇的導師分享他們的專門知識和經驗給學生。」與第二個版本相似，語序略顯不自然，且缺少「與」字，使句子結構略顯鬆散。\n第四個翻譯版本與第一個版本完全相同，語序自然，語意完整。\n第五個翻譯版本「不同範疇的導師與學生分享其專門知識與經驗」語序自然，但使用了「其」字，雖然語法正確，但與原句中「他們的」相比，略顯正式，語氣稍有差異。\n第六個翻譯版本與第一個版本完全相同，語序自然，語意完整。\n綜合考量語序、語意完整性與語氣自然度，第一個翻譯版本最為優秀，語序自然，語意完整，符合中文表達習慣，且與原句語氣一致。因此，最佳翻譯應當採用第一個版本的語序與用詞。\n\n為提升中學生的財務素養，香港金融管理局與其他持份者合作舉辦「香港財務素養錦標賽」，連續第九年舉行。活動以「數碼及可持續經濟」為主題，幫助學生學習更多關於理財、綠色及可持續發展、金融市場現狀及事業機會的知識。活動亦包括一個網上問答比賽，收到約20,000份投稿，並由來自多元化範疇的經驗豐富專業人士提供指導，以及設計思維挑戰賽。\n\n# $mart 錢財管理 321\n\n香港金融管理局推出了首款財務教育桌遊，名為「$mart Money Management 321」，該桌遊是由一家專注於桌遊製作的社會企業聯合設計及開發。此桌遊旨在協助小學生在模擬環境中學習不同的支付方法、理財概念、金融科技及網絡安全知識。\n\n香港金融管理局於2023年香港書展設立展台，推廣這款棋盤遊戲，該遊戲是展會中銷售最高的產品之一。此外，香港金融管理局舉辦了一系列免費推廣活動，包括在社區中心舉辦的工作坊、為小學學生舉辦的試玩活動，以及為小學教師及非政府組織社會工作者舉辦的培訓講師工作坊，並在節日期間於PMQ設立「$mart理財體驗中心」。\n\n香港金融管理局首個財務教育桌遊「$mart Money Management 321」及「$mart Money Management 體驗中心」獲得多項國際設計獎項。\n\n於香港書展推出後，這款桌遊透過培訓導師的工作坊、學生試玩環節，以及PMQ的體驗中心進行推廣。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與不同持份者合作，參與多個社區聯繫計劃。其中一個是與一所教育機構聯合舉辦的跨世代外展教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲，以及針對幼稚園學生、他們的家長和老師，以及年輕人的對話。\n\n香港金融管理局持續支持投資者及財務教育委員會推動香港財務素養及財務能力的工作。它將進一步與不同持份者合作，以最大化其社區聯繫工作的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高水平的透明度，香港金融管理局在適用於中央銀行業務的範圍內，採用國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務處與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則準備及呈報發行基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中，對各種費用項目和預算資訊提供詳細披露及深入分析。\n為維持高水平的透明度，香港金融管理局在適用於中央銀行業務的範圍內，採用國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務處與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則準備及呈報發行基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中，對各種費用項目和預算資訊提供詳細披露及深入分析。\n\n# 責任與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）最重要的工作之一是管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理既在日常運作中進行，亦在較高層次透過戰略規劃進行。兩個高層次委員會，即宏觀監測委員會及風險委員會，均在HKMA的風險管理架構下運作。兩委員會均由HKMA總裁擔任主席。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

交易所基金\n\n# 審計長報告書\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人確認已審核交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）載於第211至311頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及該集團於2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收入及支出賬戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，各項財務報表真實且公允地反映了基金及集團截至2023年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒發的行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7章所發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了我的審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步說明於我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與集團保持獨立，而且我亦根據這些標準履行了其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我審計截至2023年12月31日止年度財務報表時，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。這些事項在對全年財務報表的審計過程中已獲解決，並在形成我的審計意見時加以考慮，我不會就這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包含刊載於香港金融管理局2023年度報告中的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為這些資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此情況。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會對財務報表的責任\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a formal title specifying the responsibilities of two entities: the \"Monetary Authority\" and the \"Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" regarding financial statements.\n**Analysis of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - \"財政司司長\" is incorrect; the original refers to the \"Monetary Authority,\" not the \"Chief Secretary for Finance.\"  \n   - \"發鈔銀行諮詢委員會\" is also inaccurate; the original refers to the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" not the \"Issuing Bank Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - The structure is somewhat fluent but contains key translation errors.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - \"承用法定金融管理局\" is unclear and likely incorrect.  \n   - \"投資基金審核委員會審核委員會\" is redundant and confusing.  \n   - The translation is grammatically awkward and contains errors in terminology.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - \"貨幣管理機關\" is a reasonable translation for \"Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - \"外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會\" is slightly redundant but acceptable.  \n   - The translation is fluent and accurate in most parts, though slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - \"貨幣當局\" is a good translation for \"Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - \"發行基金顧問委員會審計小組\" is slightly off; \"Exchange Fund\" should be used instead of \"發行基金.\"  \n   - The translation is concise but lacks the full title of the committee.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"貨幣當局及匯兌基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會\" is accurate and fluent.  \n   - \"對財務報表的責任\" is a natural and appropriate phrasing.  \n   - This is one of the strongest translations, with only minor redundancy in \"審計小組委員會.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"儲備基金\" is incorrect; the original refers to the \"Exchange Fund,\" not the \"Reserve Fund.\"  \n   - \"顧問委員會審計小組委員會\" is redundant.  \n   - The translation is otherwise fluent but contains key terminology errors.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best approach is to use \"貨幣當局\" for \"Monetary Authority\" and \"外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會\" for \"Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" The phrase \"對財務報表的責任\" is natural and appropriate for \"responsibilities for the financial statements.\"\nThe improved translation should be concise, accurate, and reflect the formal tone of the original. It should avoid redundancy and ensure that all key terms are correctly translated.\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《發行基金條例》第7章所發出的指示，編製財務報表，以提供真實及公允的觀點，並負責貨幣管理局認為為使財務報表免於重大錯誤陳述（無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致）而必需的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n匯換基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監察集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a heading: **\"Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements.\"** The goal is to translate this into a clear, professional, and grammatically correct heading in Traditional Chinese.\nAll six translations provided by junior translators are very similar, with only minor differences in word choice and structure. Here is a critical evaluation of each:\n1. **Translation 1:** # 審計師對財務報表審計的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and professional. Uses the term “審計師” (auditor), which is standard in accounting and auditing contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None apparent. It is a strong translation.\n2. **Translation 2:** # 審計師對財務報表審計的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to Translation 1. Also accurate and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n3. **Translation 3:** # 會計師對財務報表審計的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “會計師” (accountant), which is a valid term but less precise than “審計師” in the context of an audit.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “會計師” may be interpreted as a general accountant rather than a certified auditor, which could be misleading in a formal context.\n4. **Translation 4:** # 審計師對財務報表審計的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as Translation 1 and 2. Correct and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n5. **Translation 5:** 審計人對審計財務報表的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “審計人” (auditor), which is a less common but still acceptable term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure “審計財務報表” (audit financial statements) is slightly less formal than “財務報表審計” (audit of financial statements), which is more commonly used in official documents.\n6. **Translation 6:** 審計師對財務報表審計的責任  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as Translation 1, 2, and 4. Correct and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate and professional translation is the one that uses “審計師” (auditor), which is the standard term in auditing contexts. The phrase “財務報表審計” (audit of financial statements) is more formal and commonly used in official and legal documents compared to “審計財務報表” (audit financial statements). Additionally, the use of the hashtag (#) is appropriate for a heading.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否免於重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，總是能發現存在的重大錯報。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，如果個別或合併起來，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否免於重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，總是能發現存在的重大錯報。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，如果個別或合併起來，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的一部分，我會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我意見的基礎。未能偵測出因詐欺所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，較因錯誤所致者為高，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n- 取得與審計相關的內部控制的了解，以便設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性意見的目的；\n- 評估貨幣當局所運用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中指出財務報表中相關的披露，若這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達成公平呈現的方式反映其底層交易與事件；\n- 取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當審計證據，以便對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組溝通，有關審計的計劃範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n我對六份翻譯進行了評估，發現它們在整體語意傳達上都大致正確，但在語法、用詞選擇、語句流暢度及專業性方面存在差異。以下為主要觀察：\n1. **「Exchange Fund Advisory Committee」的翻譯**：多數翻譯使用了「財政儲備基金諮詢委員會」或「交易所基金顧問委員會」，但根據香港官方機構的正式名稱，「Exchange Fund Advisory Committee」應譯為「財政儲備基金諮詢委員會」，因此第一、三、六份翻譯較為準確。\n2. **「Audit Sub-Committee」的翻譯**：多數翻譯使用了「審計小組委員會」或「審核小組」，其中「審計小組委員會」較為正式且符合機構組織架構的常見稱謂。\n3. **「relevant ethical requirements」的翻譯**：多數翻譯使用了「相關道德要求」或「相關倫理要求」，其中「道德要求」更符合香港公職人員行為守則的常用語。\n4. **語句流暢度與語法**：第一、三、六份翻譯在語句結構上較為自然，語法正確，而第二、五份翻譯在語序上稍顯生硬，例如「證明我已遵守」不如「說明我已遵守」自然。\n5. **「may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence」的翻譯**：多數翻譯使用了「可能合理認為會影響我獨立性」，其中「可能合理認為」較為準確，而第五份翻譯使用「可能被認為與我的獨立性有關」則略顯籠統。\n6. **「related safeguards」的翻譯**：多數翻譯使用了「相關的保障措施」，語意明確，符合正式文件的語境。\n綜合以上觀察，最佳翻譯應使用正式機構名稱、準確用詞、語句流暢且符合語法規範。因此，我認為第一份翻譯在整體表現上最為優秀，僅需微調語序與用詞以提升流暢度與專業性。\n我亦向財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備顧問委員會審計小組委員會溝通的問題，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最重要的問題，因此為關鍵審計問題。除非法例或規則禁止披露有關問題，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為某問題不應在報告中披露，因為這樣做所帶來的負面後果合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公眾利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些問題。\n\n林志源奈森教授 稽核總監  \n林志源教授 審計委員會主席  \n林志雲教授 審計總監  \n教授林志遠 Nelson 審計總監  \n林志源教授 審計主任  \n林志遠教授 審計署署長  \n上述六種翻譯各有其優缺點。首先，「林志源奈森教授」與「林志遠教授」、「林志雲教授」、「林志源教授」等姓名翻譯存在差異，應根據英文原名「LAM Chi Yuen Nelson」準確翻譯為「林志源奈森教授」。其次，職稱方面，「稽核總監」、「審計委員會主席」、「審計總監」、「審計主任」、「審計署署長」等稱謂各有不同，需根據「Director of Audit」的職務性質選擇最合適的稱謂。在中文語境中，「審計總監」較為常見且符合「Director」的職級，而「審計署署長」則偏向政府機構的高層職務，與「Director of Audit」不完全對應。\n此外，姓名與職稱之間的格式也需統一，例如「教授林志遠 Nelson 審計總監」的格式較為混亂，應調整為「林志源奈森教授 審計總監」。\n綜合考量姓名準確性與職稱合適性，最佳翻譯應為「林志源奈森教授 審計總監」。此翻譯不僅準確反映原名，也選擇了最符合「Director of Audit」職務的稱謂，語句流暢且符合中文語法與文化習慣。\n林志源奈森教授 審計總監\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長轉授的權限，作為外匯基金（簡稱「基金」）的主管，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。基金的主要活動是保護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產在香港貨幣局制度下，完全與貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司購入的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府為基金的戰略目的而購入。營運部門的資料載於附註31。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表是根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個集體術語，包括所有適用的個別 HKFRSs、香港會計準則及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的解釋，以及在香港更廣泛層面被接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬機構（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次於本集團當前會計期間生效或可供提前應用。附註3規定，如有因初步應用這些發展而導致會計政策的變更，則在這些財務報表所反映的當前及往期會計期間與集團相關的範圍內提供資訊。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務體現於附註16和17。\n\n財務報表編製所使用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非以下資產及負債以公允價值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公允價值透過損益帳戶計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公允價值透過其他綜合收益計量的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（附註2.11）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些判斷、估計及假設會影響政策的應用，以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設是基於歷史經驗及各種其他因素，這些因素在當時的情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了對資產和負債攜帶價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他資料來源並不容易明顯看出。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n這些翻譯整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的意思，但在語法、用詞選擇與語句流暢度方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯者**：語句結構清晰，用詞準確，但「該期間」重複使用，略顯生硬，可考慮使用「當期」或「該期間」交替使用以提升流暢度。\n2. **第二譯者**：語句通順，用詞精準，特別是「應在該期間確認」與「應在修訂期間及未來期間確認」語氣恰當，符合財務文件的正式語體。\n3. **第三譯者**：語句較為冗長，「會在當期確認會計估計的修訂」語序略顯混亂，可調整語序以提升可讀性。\n4. **第四譯者**：語句過於重複，如「該估計修訂的期間」與「修訂期間」重複，導致語意不清，需簡化語句。\n5. **第五譯者**：用詞較為繁複，如「會計估計的變更」與「會計估計的修訂」混用，應統一使用「修訂」一詞，以符合詞典要求。\n6. **第六譯者**：語句結構較為自然，但「估計被修訂的期間」語序略顯拗口，可調整為「該估計修訂的期間」以提升流暢度。\n**改進方向**：\n- 統一使用「修訂」一詞，避免混用「變更」。\n- 避免重複使用「該期間」，可交替使用「當期」與「未來期間」。\n- 調整語序，使句子更符合中文語法習慣，如將「會計估計的修訂」置於句首，以強調主語。\n- 確保語句簡潔明瞭，避免過度複雜的句式。\n**最佳翻譯**：\n估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若會計估計的修訂僅影響當期，則應在該期間確認；若修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則應在修訂期間及未來期間確認。\n\n管理層在應用香港財務報告準則時所作出的判斷，若對財務報表有重大影響，以及估計不確定性的主要資料來源，均載於附註2.18。  \n此譯文在語法、用詞及語意傳達上均表現良好，符合專業財務報告的語境。以下為各譯文的評析與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**：語意清晰，用詞準確，符合財務報告的正式語體，為最佳選擇。\n2. **第二譯文**：語意正確，但語序稍顯生硬，如「對財務報表有重大影響及主要估計不確定性來源的判斷」略顯冗長。\n3. **第三譯文**：「申請」一詞誤用，應為「應用」；「重大生效」語意不清，應為「重大影響」。\n4. **第四譯文**：「取得」與「生效」用詞不當，與原文語意不符。\n5. **第五譯文**：「申請」與「生效」用詞不當，語意不清晰。\n6. **第六譯文**：語意正確，但「資料來源」與「主要的估計不確定性資料來源」語序略顯不自然。\n根據上述評析，最佳譯文為第一譯文，語意清晰、用詞準確，符合財務報告的正式語體與語法規範。因此，最終譯文如下：\n管理層在應用香港財務報告準則時所作出的判斷，若對財務報表有重大影響，以及估計不確定性的主要資料來源，均載於附註2.18。\n\n若干比較數字已重新表述，以符合集團財務報表當年的呈列方式。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團在以下情況下控制一實體：當其暴露於或擁有來自該實體的變動回報，且有能力透過對該實體的控制來影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他第三方所持有）。\n"}
