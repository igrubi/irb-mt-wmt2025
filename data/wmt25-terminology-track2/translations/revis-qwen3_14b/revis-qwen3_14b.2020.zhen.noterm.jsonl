{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\nThe original sentence, \"2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年,\" translates to something like \"2020 can be said to be a year beyond imagination.\" The key elements to convey are the idea that 2020 was extraordinary, unexpected, and difficult to imagine.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators all capture the general meaning, but they vary in fluency, conciseness, and naturalness. \nThe first translation, \"The year 2020 was truly unimaginable,\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning, but it is slightly wordy and lacks the nuance of the original phrase, which includes the phrase \"可謂是\" (can be said to be).\nThe second translation, \"2020 was truly a year beyond imagination,\" is more concise and natural, and it captures the essence of the original phrase well. However, the use of \"truly\" is somewhat redundant and could be omitted for greater fluency.\nThe third translation, \"2020 was truly an unprecedented year,\" is also grammatically correct and conveys the idea that 2020 was unique and without precedent. However, \"unprecedented\" may not fully capture the sense of being \"beyond imagination\" as expressed in the original.\nThe fourth and sixth translations, both \"2020 was a year beyond imagination,\" are concise and natural, and they effectively convey the intended meaning. However, they omit the nuance of \"可謂是\" (can be said to be), which adds a layer of commentary or reflection.\nThe fifth translation, \"The year 2020 was an unimaginable year,\" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. It is more natural to say \"2020 was an unimaginable year\" without the article \"the.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be one that is concise, natural, and captures the nuance of the original phrase. A suitable translation would be: \"2020 was a year beyond imagination.\" This version is concise, natural, and effectively conveys the intended meaning without unnecessary words.\n2020 was a year beyond imagination.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key points: the global impact of the pandemic, the economic slowdown, Hong Kong's economic contraction, and the rise in unemployment.\n- The use of terms like \"contracted,\" \"surged,\" and \"particularly hard hit\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verbosity and Redundancy:** Some translations use phrases that are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"taking the world by surprise\" or \"bringing economic activity to a near standstill worldwide,\" which can be simplified without losing meaning.\n- **Word Choice:** The use of \"ravaged\" in the fifth translation is more dramatic than necessary and may not align with the neutral tone of the original text.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"with certain industries particularly hit hard\" or \"with some industries particularly hard-hit,\" which, while understandable, are not the most natural in English.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term \"GDP\" is used in some translations, while others use \"local gross domestic product\" or \"gross domestic product.\" Maintaining consistency in terminology is important for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain the original meaning while ensuring the English is fluent, concise, and natural. This involves:\n- Choosing more neutral and commonly used verbs (e.g., \"caught off guard\" instead of \"ravaged\").\n- Ensuring consistency in terminology (e.g., using \"GDP\" consistently).\n- Simplifying sentence structures where possible to enhance readability.\n- Using more natural phrasing, such as \"particularly hard-hit\" instead of \"particularly hit hard.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caught the world off guard, bringing economic activity to a near standstill globally. Under the pandemic's impact, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year since 2019, recording the largest-ever decline in GDP. The unemployment rate surged to a 16-year high, with certain industries particularly hard-hit.\n\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking system has once again successfully withstood the shocks. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and tone that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nThe first translation uses \"adversity\" and \"weathered the storm,\" which are idiomatic and natural in English. However, \"this is not a matter of chance\" is slightly awkward compared to more idiomatic expressions like \"this was by no means accidental.\"\nThe second translation uses \"difficulties\" and \"withstood the impact,\" which are accurate but slightly less idiomatic than \"weathered the storm.\" The phrase \"long-term commitment\" is appropriate but slightly less precise than \"long-standing commitment.\"\nThe third translation uses \"difficulties are often times when our strength is demonstrated,\" which is grammatically correct but less concise and natural than \"adversity often reveals our true strength.\" The use of \"shocks\" is appropriate, but the sentence structure is slightly awkward.\nThe fourth translation uses \"serve as the moment to demonstrate our strength,\" which is a bit wordy and less idiomatic than \"reveal our true strength.\" The phrase \"long-standing prudent policies\" is slightly less natural than \"long-standing commitment to prudent policies.\"\nThe fifth translation uses \"challenges are often opportunities to demonstrate our strength,\" which is accurate and natural. The use of \"adherence to prudent policies\" is slightly more formal than \"commitment to prudent policies,\" which may be more appropriate in this context.\nThe sixth translation is the most fluent and natural, using \"adversity often reveals our true strength\" and \"withstood the shocks.\" The phrase \"consistently prudent policies over the years\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"long-standing commitment to prudent policies.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the most natural and idiomatic expressions from the various translations, ensuring fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.\nHong Kong’s monetary and banking system has once again successfully withstood the shocks. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking system has once again successfully withstood the shocks. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which discusses the uncertain and challenging path to economic recovery, influenced by monetary policy, vaccination progress, low-interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Each translation is fluent, grammatically sound, and appropriately uses formal vocabulary suitable for economic discourse.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations effectively convey the main idea that the recovery path is not smooth and is filled with uncertainties.\n- They accurately reflect the key factors influencing the economic outlook: monetary policy, vaccination programs, low-interest rates, and geopolitical tensions.\n- The use of terms like \"uncertain,\" \"volatile,\" \"unpredictability,\" and \"complexity\" is appropriate and consistent with the tone of the original text.\n- The structure of the sentences is logical and mirrors the original Chinese in terms of flow and emphasis.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly repetitive phrasing, such as \"the outlook remains uncertain\" or \"add further uncertainty,\" which can be refined for greater variety and impact.\n- A few translations use \"low-interest-rate environment\" or \"low-interest environments,\" which are both acceptable, but \"low-interest-rate environment\" is more commonly used in economic contexts.\n- The phrase \"the path to recovery\" is used in all translations, which is fine, but \"the road to recovery\" could be an alternative for slight variation.\n- Some translations use \"add further variables\" or \"add further volatility,\" which are accurate but could be more precisely worded for clarity and impact.\n**Improvements:**\n- Vary the phrasing of uncertainty to avoid repetition.\n- Use more precise and commonly accepted economic terminology.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is varied to maintain reader engagement.\n- Maintain a consistent tone that reflects the gravity and complexity of the economic situation described.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe road to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Even with central banks and governments worldwide providing full support to the economy, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty, encompassing the stance of monetary policy, the progress of vaccination programs, and the potential impact of a prolonged low-interest-rate environment. Meanwhile, the continuous evolution of geopolitical tensions introduces further unpredictability into the macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDespite the uncertain circumstances, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will remain steadfast in its duties, maintaining monetary and financial stability and creating a conducive environment for economic recovery. Meanwhile, amid the ever-evolving landscape of the banking and financial sector, we will also strive to seize opportunities to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Stability: As Steady as Ever\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" consistently and correctly. The term \"Strong Form Exchange Guarantee\" is appropriately translated as \"Strong Form Exchange Guarantee.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"capital inflows\" instead of \"funds inflows,\" though both are acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate but uses \"currency board system\" instead of \"Linked Exchange Rate System,\" which is a misrepresentation of the system. It also uses \"strong side exchange rate guarantee,\" which is not the standard term. The term \"system\" is used instead of \"LERS,\" which is less precise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"LERS\" consistently and correctly. The term \"strong-side conversion undertakings\" is not the standard term used in official contexts, so it is slightly off. The use of \"HK$383.5 billion\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation incorrectly refers to the system as \"managed float\" instead of \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\" It also uses \"Exchange Fund Programme\" instead of \"Strong Form Exchange Guarantee,\" which is a significant error. The term \"managed float\" is not accurate for the Hong Kong system.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"LETS\" instead of \"LERS,\" which is a minor error. It also uses \"strong-side exchange guarantee,\" which is not the standard term. The use of \"383.5 billion Hong Kong dollars\" is acceptable but less concise than \"HKD 383.5 billion.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked System)\" consistently. The term \"strong-side exchange rate guarantee\" is not the standard term, but it is close. The use of \"cumulative inflows of approximately HKD 383.5 billion\" is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the standard term \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" consistently. It should use the correct term for the mechanism, which is \"Strong Form Exchange Guarantee\" or \"Strong-side Exchange Guarantee.\" The term \"cumulative inflows of approximately HKD 383.5 billion\" is the most concise and standard way to express the amount. The phrase \"weathered numerous challenges\" is more natural than \"successfully withstood\" or \"successfully weathered.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the LERS has weathered numerous challenges, fully demonstrating its ability to withstand shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The Strong Form Exchange Guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times, resulting in cumulative inflows of approximately HKD 383.5 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which discusses the stability of the Linked Exchange Rate System and the factors contributing to its credibility, as well as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in communication and technological enhancement. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the system's stability, the IMF report, the factors underpinning credibility, and the HKMA's role in communication and technology.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"fiscal and foreign exchange reserves,\" \"sound financial regulation,\" and \"prudent fiscal policies.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"currency board system\" instead of \"Linked Exchange Rate System,\" which is inaccurate. The correct term is \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** A few translations have minor grammatical issues, such as \"timely provides the latest factual and data information\" (awkward phrasing) or \"swiftly dispels rumors and timely provides\" (lack of parallel structure).\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"the public\" is acceptable, but \"the industry\" could be more precisely rendered as \"the financial industry\" or \"the business community\" for clarity.\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"pegged exchange rate system\" or \"currency board system,\" which are not the exact terms used in the original text. Consistency in terminology is crucial for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct term \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" is used consistently.\n- Improve sentence flow and parallel structure, especially in phrases like \"swiftly dispels rumors and timely provides.\"\n- Use more precise terms such as \"financial industry\" instead of \"the industry\" for clarity.\n- Ensure that the phrasing is natural and fluent in English, avoiding awkward or overly literal translations.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System has remained stable thanks to the solid foundation built over the years. As summarized in the International Monetary Fund’s “2020 External Sector Report,” the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System is based on transparent operational rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal policies. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with the financial industry and effectively communicates with the public through traditional and social media, swiftly clarifying rumors and providing the latest facts and data when appropriate. The HKMA also leverages the latest technology and data analytics to continuously enhance its monitoring capabilities, allowing it to flexibly respond to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic placed significant pressure on the economy, the banking system remained sound, with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.7%, far exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks was also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, the quality of bank assets slightly deteriorated, with the specific classified loan ratio rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020. However, this remained sound and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: The Lifeline of the Economy\nThe original title, \"銀行體系：經濟命脈,\" is concise and impactful, with \"經濟命脈\" carrying a strong metaphorical weight, suggesting that the banking system is essential to the economy's survival and function.\nAmong the translations, several are very close to the original in both structure and meaning. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations all use \"The Lifeline of the Economy,\" which is a direct and idiomatic translation of \"經濟命脈.\" These versions are accurate and natural in English, maintaining the metaphor and the emphasis on the banking system's critical role.\nThe third translation, \"Banking System: Economic Lifeline,\" is slightly more concise but loses the definite article \"The,\" which may slightly weaken the emphasis. The fourth translation, \"Banking System: The Pulse of the Economy,\" is a creative alternative that uses \"pulse\" instead of \"lifeline.\" While \"pulse\" is a valid metaphor for something vital and rhythmic, it is less commonly used in economic contexts and may not convey the same level of critical importance as \"lifeline.\"\nIn terms of formatting, the original includes a hashtag (#) at the beginning, which is common in digital or social media contexts. Some translations, like the third, fifth, and sixth, retain the hashtag, while others do not. Whether to include the hashtag depends on the intended use of the translation. If it's for a formal document or publication, the hashtag may be unnecessary. If it's for a digital platform or social media, retaining it would be appropriate.\nConsidering fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness, the best translations are those that use \"The Lifeline of the Economy\" with or without the hashtag, depending on context. \"Lifeline\" is a well-established metaphor in English and effectively conveys the critical importance of the banking system to the economy.\nThe most balanced and natural translation, suitable for a wide range of contexts, is:\n**Banking System: The Lifeline of the Economy**\n\nThe banking system plays a crucial role as a financial intermediary in the economy and society. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to focus on supervising banks' credit and liquidity risks, while also closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and implementing various measures to ensure the banking system could continue providing essential services and offering loan support to the economy. In March, the HKMA reduced the countercyclical buffer capital ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it lowered the regulatory reserve requirements. These measures collectively freed up approximately HKD 1 trillion in additional lending capacity for the banking system.\n\nWe are fully aware that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face cash flow pressures in the current economic environment. To address this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the banking sector, established the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in 2019 and introduced a series of relief measures, including the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme, which deferred the principal repayments of all eligible enterprises' loans for six months. By the end of 2020, banks had processed over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 740 billion. Given the recurring nature of the pandemic, the HKMA extended the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme and prolonged it until the end of October 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also introduced the \"100% Guaranteed Special Loan\" under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to help SMEs with their employee salaries and rent payments. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving a total amount of approximately HKD 40 billion. The program was optimized in the first quarter of 2021, and the application deadline was extended to December 31, 2021. Throughout the year, banks also processed over 28,000 relief measure applications, assisting individual customers with their cash flow needs, involving a total amount of HKD 44 billion. The banking sector's united efforts in supporting both businesses and individual customers through these difficult times are truly encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the banking sector's efforts to enhance financial inclusion and foster a customer-centric culture. We further encourage banks to pay particular attention to vulnerable customers and to share best practices in various areas, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more accessible and user-friendly banking services.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the operating environment of the banking industry has also undergone swift transformation. Therefore, the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is not limited to addressing current challenges, but also requires a forward-looking perspective, expanding the talent pool to align with the future development of the banking sector. We have jointly launched the \"Enhancing the Professional Competencies of Future Banking Talent\" research initiative with the Hong Kong Bankers Association and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, aiming to assess potential talent gaps in the banking industry over the next few years and to provide banks with a clear roadmap, enabling them to proactively address and improve the talent supply situation. Additionally, we have introduced the \"Banking Talent Launchpad Program,\" offering recent graduates from local universities a six-month internship and specialized training related to the banking industry, thereby cultivating talent for the sector. Launching this program during a challenging period in the local labor market also provides opportunities for young people aspiring to enter the banking industry.\n\n# Status as an International Financial Center: Unshaken by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's key responsibilities—supporting Hong Kong's status as an international financial center—our future plans encompass not only the banking system but also the entire financial system, aiming to ensure Hong Kong remains competitive as an international financial center in an evolving financial landscape. During the pandemic, we have continued to steadily advance these initiatives while proactively exploring new opportunities in several key areas to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by emerging trends and transformations.\n\n# Drive Green Finance, Create a More Sustainable Future\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is a concise and impactful headline: “推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來.” It uses two main verbs: “推動” (to drive\/promote) and “締造” (to create\/forged), with the goal being “更可持續的未來” (a more sustainable future). The translations provided by the junior translators are all quite close in meaning, but there are subtle differences in tone, fluency, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n- **Translation 1** (\"Promoting green finance to create a more sustainable future\") is grammatically correct and fluent, but the use of \"to create\" feels slightly passive compared to the active tone of the original.\n- **Translation 2** (\"# Promote Green Finance, Forge a More Sustainable Future\") uses \"Promote\" and \"Forge,\" which are both strong verbs. However, \"Promote\" is less dynamic than \"Drive\" and \"Forge\" is more metaphorical than the direct \"締造.\"\n- **Translation 3** (\"# Drive Green Finance, Forge a More Sustainable Future\") uses \"Drive,\" which is more active and aligns well with “推動.” However, \"Forge\" is still a bit metaphorical and may not fully capture the meaning of “締造.”\n- **Translation 4** (\"Promoting green finance for a more sustainable future\") is grammatically correct but lacks the active tone of the original. The use of \"for\" makes it feel more like a purpose than an action.\n- **Translation 5** (\"Promoting Green Finance to Create a More Sustainable Future\") is very close to the original in structure and tone, with \"Create\" being a direct and active verb.\n- **Translation 6** (\"Promoting Green Finance, Creating a More Sustainable Future\") uses a parallel structure, which is stylistically appealing, but the use of \"Creating\" as a gerund may weaken the directness of the message.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the key is to maintain the active and dynamic tone of the original while ensuring clarity and fluency in English. \"Drive\" is a stronger and more active verb than \"Promote\" and better reflects the force of “推動.” \"Create\" is more direct and active than \"Forge\" or \"Creating.\" Additionally, the use of a comma to separate the two actions (\"Drive Green Finance, Create a More Sustainable Future\") maintains the parallel structure of the original while ensuring clarity and impact.\n**Final Translation:**\n# Drive Green Finance, Create a More Sustainable Future\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which outlines Hong Kong's progress in promoting green and sustainable finance, particularly through a three-phase initiative launched in 2019. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the first category as \"promoting green and sustainable finance.\"\n- The timeline (since May 2019) and key milestones (e.g., the 2020 assessment of 47 banks, the white paper, and the regulatory framework) are consistently captured.\n- The mention of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is present in most translations, with some including the acronym (TCFD) for clarity.\n- The final sentence about Hong Kong becoming the first region in Asia to implement specific requirements is accurately translated in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Ideal progress\"** in the fourth translation is awkward and not idiomatic in English. \"Significant progress\" or \"notable progress\" is more natural.\n- **\"Green Benchmarks\"** vs. **\"green benchmark\"** – the original uses “綠色基準,” which is best translated as “Green Benchmarks” with a capital “B” to reflect the official name of the initiative.\n- **\"Green Reference\"** in the sixth translation is an incorrect translation of “綠色基準.” “Reference” does not convey the intended meaning of a benchmark or standard.\n- **\"Issued a notice\"** vs. **\"issued a circular\"** – \"circular\" is more appropriate in a regulatory or official context, as used in the fifth and sixth translations.\n- **\"Fully advancing\"** vs. **\"fully committed to advancing\"** – the latter is more natural and commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **\"Pushing forward with\"** in the sixth translation is slightly informal compared to \"advancing\" or \"fully committed to advancing.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use **\"Green Benchmarks\"** with a capital \"B\" to reflect the official name of the initiative.\n- Use **\"circular\"** instead of \"notice\" for formal regulatory communication.\n- Use **\"fully committed to advancing\"** for a more natural and formal tone.\n- Ensure **\"TCFD\"** is included with the full name for clarity.\n- Use **\"notable progress\"** or **\"significant progress\"** instead of \"ideal progress.\"\n- Maintain a consistent and formal tone throughout, as the original text is likely from an official or policy document.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe first category involves promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the introduction of a three-phase initiative in May 2019, notable progress has been made. In 2020, we completed the \"Green Benchmarks\" assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued a circular providing guidance and sharing experience on how banks can manage climate risks. We are also fully committed to advancing the work of the second phase, establishing a regulatory framework for the banking sector to manage climate risks. Furthermore, we will strive to require banks to disclose climate-related information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 at the latest. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to implement such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world's largest reserve managers, we actively integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into our processes for selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investments in green, social, and sustainable bonds and low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong’s green finance ecosystem, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been assisting the government in issuing green bonds, with the recently issued second batch of government green bonds proving particularly popular with international investors. Building on this development, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021–22 Budget that the government would expand the scale of the “Government Green Bond Programme,” doubling the borrowing ceiling to HK$2,000 billion and increasing the variety and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance, one of the key components of our overall strategy is to collaborate with local regulatory bodies and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has joined other regulators to establish an Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance, which coordinates relevant measures within the financial sector. This group has already developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the HKMA has become a founding member and the first regional executive director of the Asia region of the \"Green Banking Alliance.\" The Alliance aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting with Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the aforementioned work to help reduce climate risks faced by the financial sector and enable Hong Kong banks to leverage their strengths to meet the substantial funding needs of green investments in the region.\n\n# FinTech Brings Convenience to Citizens and Benefits the Economy\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is concise and impactful: “# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟.” The key elements are “金融科技” (FinTech), “方便市民” (brings convenience to citizens), and “裨益經濟” (benefits the economy). The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions.\n1. **Translation 1:** “Financial technology facilitates citizens’ lives and benefits the economy.”  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate in meaning, uses formal language.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Facilitates citizens’ lives” is slightly vague and less direct than “brings convenience to citizens.” Also, the use of “facilitates” may not fully capture the nuance of “方便” (convenience).\n2. **Translation 2:** “FinTech facilitates citizens' lives and benefits the economy.”  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the common abbreviation “FinTech,” which is more natural in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue as Translation 1 with “facilitates citizens’ lives.”\n3. **Translation 3:** “# FinTech brings convenience to citizens and benefits the economy.”  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate, natural, and concise. Uses “brings convenience,” which is a direct and idiomatic expression.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong candidate.\n4. **Translation 4:** “# FinTech makes it convenient for citizens and benefits the economy.”  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “makes it convenient,” which is a common expression.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more wordy than necessary. “Makes it convenient for citizens” is slightly less direct than “brings convenience to citizens.”\n5. **Translation 5:** “Financial technology benefits citizens and boosts the economy.”  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “boosts the economy,” which is a strong and common phrase.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits the nuance of “方便” (convenience), which is central to the original message.\n6. **Translation 6:** “# Fintech Conveniences Citizens and Benefits the Economy”  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the hashtag and all caps for emphasis, which may be appropriate for a title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Conveniences” is an awkward and rarely used verb form. It is not idiomatic in English and may confuse readers.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTranslation 3 is the most accurate and natural, capturing both the convenience and economic benefit aspects of the original text. It uses “FinTech,” which is the standard abbreviation in English, and the phrasing “brings convenience to citizens” is both idiomatic and direct. The hashtag is preserved, which is appropriate for the context. The only minor adjustment is to ensure that the tone is consistent with the original, which is formal yet accessible.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# FinTech Brings Convenience to Citizens and Benefits the Economy\n\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial sector is fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further under the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFinancial technology, or fintech, is a rapidly evolving field that has become a significant force in driving innovation and efficiency in the financial industry. The original sentence highlights the role of fintech as a \"major engine\" of growth and notes that the pace of development has \"accelerated\" during the pandemic. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and precision that affect the quality of the translations.\nThe first translation uses \"engine\" and \"development,\" which are accurate, but \"has only accelerated\" is slightly less dynamic than alternatives. The second translation uses \"driver\" and \"fintech,\" which is more concise and modern, and \"accelerated further\" is a strong expression. The third translation is similar but uses \"financial industry\" instead of \"financial sector,\" which is slightly less common in formal English. The fourth translation uses \"key driver\" and \"progress,\" which are both appropriate, and \"even further\" adds nuance. The fifth translation uses \"engine\" and \"novel coronavirus,\" which is technically correct but less commonly used than \"COVID-19.\" The sixth translation uses \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is more verbose and less idiomatic.\nThe best translation should use \"fintech\" for conciseness, \"driver\" or \"engine\" for the role of fintech, and \"accelerated further\" to convey the increased pace. \"Financial sector\" is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"financial industry.\" \"Under the COVID-19 pandemic\" is more natural than \"during the coronavirus pandemic\" or \"during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\"\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial sector is fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which highlights the role of fintech, particularly the \"轉數快\" (FPS) system, in expanding financial tools and facilitating transactions during the pandemic. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key points: fintech's role in expanding the \"toolkit,\" the unprecedented role of electronic payments during the pandemic, the growth of FPS accounts, the surge in transaction volume, and the government collaboration.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"fast payment system,\" \"registered accounts,\" and \"transaction volume.\"\n- The use of \"FPS\" as an acronym for \"Fast Payment System\" is consistent across translations, though some use \"Transfer Quick\" or \"Faster Payment\" as alternative names, which may not be as widely recognized.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Faster Payment\" or \"Transfer Quick\" instead of \"FPS,\" which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the system. The official name is \"轉數快,\" which is commonly translated as \"FPS\" or \"Fast Payment System.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"had already recorded 6.9 million registered accounts\" or \"causing the average daily transaction volume... to surge 2.3 times.\" These phrases are grammatically correct but lack the natural flow of professional writing.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"toolkit\" is appropriate, but the use of \"surge\" or \"increase\" may be better suited to the context of transaction volume. Also, the phrase \"make and transfer funds\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified to \"make payments and transfer funds.\"\n- **Tense and Voice:** Some translations use passive voice unnecessarily, such as \"had already recorded 6.9 million registered accounts,\" which can be more direct as \"had already registered 6.9 million accounts.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FPS\" consistently as the primary name for the system, with \"Fast Payment System\" in parentheses for clarity.\n- Simplify and streamline phrases for better fluency, such as \"leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the average daily transaction volume\" instead of \"causing the average daily transaction volume... to surge 2.3 times.\"\n- Ensure that the tone is professional and consistent with official reports or policy documents.\n- Use active voice where appropriate to enhance clarity and readability.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe past year has clearly demonstrated that financial technology can expand our \"toolkit\" to address sudden shocks. In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. From its launch in September 2018 to the end of 2020, the Fast Payment System (FPS), known as \"Transfer Quick,\" had already registered 6.9 million accounts. Even with social distancing measures in place, the public was able to use \"Transfer Quick\" as a secure, fast, and reliable method to make payments and transfer funds, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the average daily transaction volume in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the application of \"Transfer Quick\" to cover the payment of a wider range of government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, fintech also helps banks offer more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have fully commenced operations in Hong Kong this year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, with aggregate customer deposits amounting to HK$15 billion. Some of these virtual banks have already begun using new types of data for credit assessments to target new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified compliance technology ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of its \"Banking Easy\" initiative, aiming to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to issuing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of compliance technology applications, the HKMA has also published a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of compliance technology in the banking sector. Furthermore, the HKMA has launched the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" project to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to more conveniently access bank financing by leveraging their digital footprints.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Consistency**: \n   - The term \"金管局\" is consistently translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in most translations, which is appropriate. However, some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" or \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" inconsistently, which may confuse readers.\n   - The name of the initiative varies between \"Cybersecurity Initiative 2.0,\" \"Cyber Defense Program 2.0,\" \"Network Defense Plan 2.0,\" and \"Cyber Resilience Assessment 2.0.\" The original text uses \"網絡防衛計劃2.0,\" which is best translated as \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\" for consistency and clarity.\n   - \"監管科技\" is translated as \"RegTech\" in most translations, which is correct and widely accepted in the industry.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - Most translations are grammatically sound, but some sentences are slightly awkward or repetitive. For example, \"we have launched\" and \"we are launching\" are used interchangeably, which may not reflect the original intent accurately.\n   - The phrase \"to improve the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes\" is well phrased in some translations, but \"forward-looking nature\" could be more naturally expressed as \"proactive nature\" or \"forward-looking approach.\"\n3. **Vocabulary and Nuance**:\n   - The original text uses \"嚴謹的監管\" which is best translated as \"rigorous regulation\" or \"prudent supervision.\" \"Prudent supervision\" may be more appropriate in a regulatory context.\n   - \"現場審查\" is translated as \"on-site reviews\" or \"on-site inspections.\" \"On-site reviews\" is more precise in the context of regulatory assessments.\n   - \"創新信用風險評估方法\" is translated as \"innovative credit risk assessment methods,\" which is accurate and natural.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**:\n   - The translations are culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience familiar with financial regulation. However, the use of \"HKMA\" should be spelled out in full on first mention, as is standard in formal writing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe landscape of financial technology is evolving rapidly, and the application of technology is becoming increasingly widespread. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must continue to maintain prudent supervision. To this end, we have launched the \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\" to enhance banks' cybersecurity capabilities. We have also strengthened on-site reviews of technology risk management and established a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products that utilize innovative credit risk assessment methods. The HKMA has also initiated a three-year plan to apply regulatory technology, aiming to improve the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes. Current efforts include more effectively leveraging data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering supervision.\n"}

The labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the severe economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's banking system remains robust, with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the pandemic increasing uncertainties, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets operated smoothly and orderly, reflecting the stability of Hong Kong's monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee being triggered multiple times. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the linked exchange rate system and the market's confidence in it.\n\n# Banking System Stability\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking System Stability\" in English. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in formality and punctuation but all aim to convey the same core message.\nThe first and second translations, \"Banking system stability\" and \"Banking System Stability,\" are both grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. The difference lies in capitalization, with the second version using title case, which may be more appropriate in formal or official contexts.\nThe third translation, \"# Banking System Stability,\" includes the hashtag symbol, which is not present in the original text. This may be an unnecessary addition unless the context specifically requires it, such as in social media or online platforms.\nThe fourth and sixth translations, \"Banking system stable\" and \"Banking system stable,\" are grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"system stable\" is not a standard English construction. The correct form would be \"system stability\" or \"stable system,\" depending on the intended meaning.\nThe fifth translation, \"Banking System Stability,\" is identical to the second one and is grammatically correct and appropriately capitalized.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Banking System Stability,\" as it is grammatically correct, uses appropriate capitalization, and accurately conveys the intended meaning without unnecessary punctuation or incorrect phrasing.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reflect its dual focus on monitoring the pandemic's impact and supervising risk management.\n- The key terms such as \"credit and liquidity risk management,\" \"cyber risks,\" \"technology risk management,\" \"operational resilience,\" and \"consumer protection\" are consistently translated, which is crucial for maintaining the formal and regulatory tone of the original text.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, with the first clause describing the HKMA's monitoring activities and the second clause detailing its supervisory actions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The first junior translator uses \"epidemic,\" while others use \"pandemic.\" \"Pandemic\" is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to a widespread disease outbreak.\n- **Institutional Name:** The sixth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is a critical error.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** The fifth translation uses \"monitoring banks' credit and liquidity risk management\" instead of \"supervising\" or \"regulating,\" which is less precise in the context of regulatory oversight.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations, such as the first and third, use \"continuing to focus on supervising\" which is slightly redundant. A more concise phrasing like \"continues to focus on supervising\" is preferable.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"operational resilience\" is standard in financial regulation, but \"operational soundness\" (used in the fifth translation) is less common and may be less precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"pandemic\" instead of \"epidemic\" for accuracy.\n- Ensure the correct institutional name is used: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use consistent and precise terminology such as \"supervising\" or \"regulating\" for regulatory actions.\n- Maintain a clear and concise structure, avoiding redundancy.\n- Use standard regulatory terminology like \"operational resilience\" and \"consumer protection.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to focus on supervising banks' credit and liquidity risk management while closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. Given the ongoing rise in cyber risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the HKMA has strengthened its oversight of banks' technology risk management, operational resilience, and consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) granting banks flexibility during the pandemic and collaborating on regulatory frameworks for financial services. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the core message of granting flexibility and collaboration on regulatory frameworks.\n- The term \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" is consistently translated, which is crucial for maintaining the proper name of the program.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology such as \"guidance,\" \"implementation details,\" and \"family office.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"jointly formulated with other relevant authorities\" which is slightly awkward. Also, \"issued guidance\" is less precise than \"provided guidance.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. Also, \"jointly with other relevant authorities formulated\" is awkwardly worded.\n- **Translation 3** is the most fluent and accurate, using \"worked with\" and \"developed implementation details\" which are natural phrasings. However, \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" should be in quotes or italics for clarity.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the best version, but \"developed the implementation guidelines\" is slightly less precise than \"formulated the implementation details.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Pilot Program\" instead of \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"guidelines\" is less precise than \"guidance.\"\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"clients\" instead of \"customers,\" which is less standard in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is used for clarity.\n- Use \"formulated\" or \"developed\" for the implementation details, as these are standard terms in regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"provided guidance\" rather than \"issued guidance\" or \"guidelines\" for consistency with the original text.\n- Ensure the program name \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" is correctly quoted and not altered.\n- Maintain consistent use of \"customers\" or \"clients\" based on the original tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has granted banks flexibility to continue providing services to customers during the pandemic. The HKMA has also worked with other relevant authorities to formulate the implementation details for the pilot program of the \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" business, as well as to provide guidance on family offices and wealth management services.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help banks more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to promote information sharing among public and private sector partners, as well as support the banking industry's adoption of compliance technology.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the introduction of new rules, alignment with international standards, the three-phase approach in green banking, and the development of resolution mechanisms.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent across most translations, which is appropriate for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"disposal\" (e.g., Translation 4) instead of \"resolution,\" which is less standard in financial regulatory contexts. \"Resolution\" is the more commonly used term in banking and regulatory literature.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"Introducing multiple new rules and regulations within the year\" (Translation 3), which is less natural than \"New rules and regulations will be introduced this year.\"\n- **Consistency:** There is inconsistency in the use of terms like \"resolution planning\" vs. \"resolution implementation\" (Translation 2) or \"disposal planning\" (Translation 4), which can confuse the reader.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"disposal\" may be misinterpreted in a financial regulatory context, as it can imply asset liquidation rather than the structured resolution of a failing bank.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"resolution\" consistently for terms related to bank failure management, as it is the standard term in regulatory and financial contexts.\n- Ensure sentence structure is fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations.\n- Maintain consistency in terminology throughout the translation.\n- Use formal and professional language appropriate for regulatory and financial documents.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nNew rules and regulations will be introduced this year to strengthen the regulatory framework of the banking system, aligning with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing the relevant regulatory requirements. The HKMA is also committed to establishing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and building resolution execution capabilities to ensure Hong Kong has a credible banking resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nHong Kong's status as an international financial center.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent, but there are subtle differences that affect the quality and appropriateness of each version. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations are nearly identical, with the only difference being the capitalization of \"status\" in the sixth version. While both are grammatically correct, the lowercase version (\"status\") is more commonly used in titles unless it is the first word in a sentence or part of a proper noun.\nThe third translation includes a hashtag (#), which is not appropriate in this context unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform that uses hashtags for categorization. Since the original text appears to be a title or heading, the hashtag is unnecessary and detracts from the formality and professionalism of the translation.\nThe fourth translation uses \"Centre\" with a 'c' instead of 'center' with an's'. This is a British English spelling variation. While both spellings are acceptable, \"center\" is more commonly used in American English, which is the dominant variant in international financial contexts. However, the choice between \"center\" and \"centre\" is largely a matter of style and regional preference, and both are correct.\nThe sixth translation also uses lowercase for \"status,\" which is slightly less formal than the capitalized version. In titles, it is common to capitalize all major words, including \"status,\" unless it is a preposition or article.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be one that maintains consistency with standard title capitalization, avoids unnecessary formatting like hashtags, and uses the most widely accepted spelling (\"center\" rather than \"centre\"). Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be:\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in promoting fintech development, the growing adoption of fintech by banks and payment sectors, the surge in transactions via the fast payment system \"轉數快\" (FPS), and the HKMA's involvement in cross-border cooperation on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"Fast Transfer\" is not the official name of the system. The translation is otherwise fluent and accurate in content.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"FPS\" as the system's name. The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology. However, \"collaborations\" is slightly less formal than \"cooperation.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** Uses \"Overseas Remittance Express\" for \"轉數快,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"financial technology ecosystem\" is slightly wordy compared to \"fintech ecosystem.\" The use of \"HKMA\" is correct, but the system name is mistranslated.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Turns Fast\" for \"轉數快,\" which is not the official name. The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"FPS\" for the system. The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology. However, \"digital currency\" is singular, while the original refers to \"digital currencies\" in plural.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Faster Payment System\" for \"轉數快,\" which is not the official name. The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- Use the official name of the fast payment system, which is \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n- Use \"digital currencies\" in plural to match the original.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for financial policy discussions.\n- Ensure fluency and natural English expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with banks and the payment industry increasingly adopting fintech solutions. Transaction volume on the Fast Payment System \"FPS\" has surged rapidly. The HKMA is actively participating in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong’s position as a global hub for offshore RMB businesses remains solid, and it continues to serve as a key gateway to mainland China. Financial links between Hong Kong and the mainland continue to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and connectivity mechanisms. Good progress has also been made this year in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to enhance Hong Kong's financial platform by focusing on two key areas: asset and wealth management corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and clarity.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"corporate treasury centers\" and \"green and sustainable finance.\" The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate but slightly less precise in terms of the original structure. It uses \"capabilities in green and sustainable finance\" instead of \"competitiveness,\" which slightly deviates from the original emphasis.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise but lacks some clarity. The phrase \"the competitiveness of asset and wealth management corporate treasury centers\" is awkwardly phrased and could be more natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is fluent but slightly off in meaning. It uses \"corporate finance centers for asset and wealth management,\" which is not an exact match for the original term \"corporate treasury centers.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural, using \"treasury centres\" and \"green and sustainable finance sector\" appropriately. It maintains the original structure well.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very close to the first one, with a slight difference in phrasing (\"in the areas of green and sustainable finance\" vs. \"in the field of green and sustainable finance\"). Both are acceptable, but the first is slightly more concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, use natural English phrasing, and maintain the emphasis on the HKMA's efforts to enhance Hong Kong's financial platform through specific sectors. It should also be concise and avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong's financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of corporate treasury centers in asset and wealth management, as well as in the field of green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nDespite the complex and volatile investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, achieving a return rate of 5.3%, with all five major investment categories posting positive returns.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in promoting responsible investment and asset diversification, along with the performance of the long-term growth portfolio since 2009. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, specificity, and adherence to English conventions.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the core message: the HKMA's commitment to responsible investment and asset diversification, and the portfolio's performance.\n- The term \"annualized internal rate of return\" is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The use of \"since the commencement of investments in 2009\" is grammatically sound and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Ambiguity in the name of the authority:** Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the context. The most accurate and specific term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- **Variation in verb usage:** Some translations use \"strive to promote\" or \"commit to promoting,\" which are stylistically different but not incorrect. However, \"continues to promote\" is more direct and commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Capitalization of \"Long-term Growth Portfolio\":** While not grammatically incorrect, capitalizing the name of the portfolio may be unnecessary unless it is an official title. The lowercase version is more natural in general English usage.\n- **Redundancy in phrasing:** \"Since its investment commencement in 2009\" is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"since the commencement of investments in 2009\" or \"since 2009.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full and official name of the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use consistent and direct language: \"continues to promote\" is more concise and natural than \"strive to promote\" or \"commit to promoting.\"\n- Avoid unnecessary capitalization of the portfolio name unless it is an official title.\n- Simplify the phrase \"since its investment commencement in 2009\" to \"since 2009\" or \"since the commencement of investments in 2009.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 13.7% since 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions and Social Responsibility\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upheld high standards of corporate governance, supporting employees in enhancing their professional capabilities, implementing strict financial controls, and strengthening information technology capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as an increasingly demanding workload.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities, striving to become a responsible and sustainable institution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA implemented special work arrangements to ensure the continued normal operation of its essential functions while safeguarding the health of its staff. The HKMA also introduced a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, helping to mitigate the adverse impacts caused by the pandemic.\n"}

The junior translators have provided several variations, including \"April 9,\" \"April 9th,\" and \"April 9th\" with or without the \"#\" symbol. \nThe use of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary in this context, as it is typically used for headings or labels in lists, not for dates. Therefore, translations 1, 4, and 5 are more appropriate in terms of formatting.\nRegarding the date format, both \"April 9\" and \"April 9th\" are grammatically correct. However, in formal or written English, \"April 9\" is more commonly used, especially in contexts such as historical records, calendars, or formal documents. \"April 9th\" is more conversational and is often used in spoken English or informal writing.\nConsidering the context of the original text, which appears to be a simple date entry, the most appropriate and natural translation would be \"April 9.\" This format is concise, clear, and aligns with standard English conventions for written dates.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) decision to increase liquidity in the interbank market by reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Notes, in response to global macroeconomic volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the action of reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Notes.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology such as \"interbank market,\" \"liquidity,\" and \"macroeconomic environment.\"\n- The core message of ensuring the smooth operation of the interbank market amid global volatility is preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Exchange Fund Notes\" while others use \"Exchange Fund Bills.\" The correct term is \"Exchange Fund Notes.\"\n- **Numerical Accuracy:** One translation incorrectly states \"20 billion\" instead of \"200 billion\" in the original text.\n- **Fluency and Structure:** Some translations are awkwardly worded, such as \"amidst the volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic on the global macroeconomic environment,\" which is grammatically incorrect and awkwardly phrased.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"Hong Kong dollar interbank market\" unnecessarily, which can be simplified for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct term \"Exchange Fund Notes.\"\n- Ensure numerical accuracy (200 billion HKD).\n- Improve sentence structure for fluency and clarity, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- Use \"global macroeconomic environment\" consistently and correctly.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be concise, accurate, and fluent, using the correct terminology and structure.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that it will increase overall Hong Kong dollar liquidity in the interbank market by reducing the issuance of HKD 200 billion in Exchange Fund Notes, helping to ensure the smooth operation of the Hong Kong dollar interbank market amid volatility in the global macroeconomic environment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n# April 22\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese for marking dates, often seen in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are technically correct in terms of date formatting. However, there are minor differences in style and punctuation that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use \"April 22nd,\" which is grammatically correct in English and commonly used in informal contexts. The second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"April 22\" without the ordinal suffix, which is also acceptable, especially in more formal or technical contexts where the ordinal is often omitted.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in translations 2, 5, and 6 is notable. In Chinese, the \"#\" symbol is sometimes used to denote a heading or a section title, similar to how it might be used in digital or online contexts. However, in standard English formatting, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used for dates unless it is part of a specific system or platform (e.g., social media, hashtags). Therefore, including the \"#\" symbol may be unnecessary or misleading in a general English context.\nIn terms of fluency and cultural appropriateness, the most neutral and widely acceptable format would be \"April 22\" without the ordinal or the \"#\" symbol. This format is commonly used in formal writing, official documents, and international contexts, making it the most universally appropriate choice.\nThe best possible translation would be concise, clear, and in line with standard English conventions for date formatting.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) announcement of a temporary liquidity arrangement to support licensed banks and ease liquidity constraints in the global interbank market. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and precision.\n**Translation 1** is clear and accurate, using \"US dollar liquidity facility\" and \"liquidity constraints\" effectively. However, it lacks the acronym \"HKMA,\" which is commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Translation 2** uses \"U.S. dollar\" and \"interbank lending market,\" which are precise. The term \"alleviate liquidity shortages\" is slightly more formal than \"ease liquidity constraints,\" but both are acceptable.\n**Translation 3** includes the acronym \"HKMA\" and uses \"liquidity stress,\" which is a more nuanced term than \"liquidity constraints\" or \"shortages.\" It is well-structured and natural-sounding.\n**Translation 4** uses \"USD\" and \"liquidity tightness,\" which are concise but slightly less common in formal financial writing. The use of \"USD\" is acceptable, but \"US dollar\" may be more reader-friendly in this context.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 2, but it uses \"liquidity shortage\" and \"interbank lending market.\" It is accurate but slightly less varied in vocabulary.\n**Translation 6** uses \"dollar\" instead of \"US dollar\" or \"USD,\" which is less precise in a financial context. It also uses \"bank lending market\" instead of \"interbank lending market,\" which is slightly less specific.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should include the acronym \"HKMA\" for clarity and conciseness, use \"US dollar\" for readability, and employ precise financial terminology such as \"liquidity stress\" or \"liquidity constraints.\" The phrase \"global US dollar interbank lending market\" is more specific and accurate than \"global dollar bank lending market.\" Additionally, the use of \"temporary liquidity arrangement\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for an official announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the establishment of a temporary US dollar liquidity arrangement to provide US dollar liquidity support to licensed banks and help alleviate liquidity stress in the global US dollar interbank lending market.\n\n# October 23rd\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"# October 23rd,\" which includes a hashtag symbol. This may be appropriate in certain digital or social media contexts, but it is not standard in formal or general English writing. The second and third translations use \"October 23rd\" and \"October 23,\" respectively. The third translation omits the \"rd\" suffix, which is less formal and may be acceptable in informal contexts but not in formal writing. The sixth translation uses \"# October 23,\" which combines the hashtag with the omission of the \"rd\" suffix, making it the least standard of all.\nIn terms of grammar and vocabulary, all translations are correct in terms of the date format. However, the use of the hashtag is not standard in formal English and may be unnecessary unless the context specifically requires it. The inclusion of the \"rd\" suffix is more formal and appropriate for general use.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"October 23rd,\" which is the most standard and formal way to express the date in English without unnecessary symbols or omissions.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of an official announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, formality, and clarity that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and concise, using \"HKMA\" and \"authorized institutions,\" which are appropriate terms in this context. However, it lacks the full name of the authority, which may be less formal than required for an official statement.\n**Translation 2** uses \"licensed institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions,\" which is a minor but notable difference. In the context of financial regulation, \"authorized\" is more commonly used in relation to institutions designated by the HKMA. Additionally, it uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and includes \"has announced,\" which adds a slight nuance of ongoing action, though it is still grammatically correct.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 1 but reorders the phrase \"for the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong,\" which is slightly less direct than the original sentence structure. It is still clear but not as precise in mirroring the original's emphasis on the market being \"in Hong Kong.\"\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and uses the full name of the authority. It also uses \"Renminbi\" instead of \"RMB,\" which is more formal and appropriate for official contexts. However, the phrase \"in the Hong Kong offshore Renminbi market\" is slightly awkward compared to the more natural \"Hong Kong's offshore RMB market.\"\n**Translation 5** is grammatically correct and includes the full name of the authority. It uses \"has designated\" to reflect the completed action, which is appropriate. However, the phrase \"for Hong Kong's offshore RMB market\" is slightly less direct than the original.\n**Translation 6** is the most concise but omits the full name of the authority and uses \"9\" instead of \"nine,\" which is less formal and less suitable for an official statement.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formality and clarity of the original, use the full name of the authority, and employ the most appropriate terminology. \"Authorized institutions\" is more accurate than \"licensed institutions\" in this context. \"Renminbi\" is more formal than \"RMB\" in official statements. The phrase \"in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market\" is the most direct and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as primary liquidity providers in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market.\n\n# November 25th\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese for marking specific dates, often seen in calendars, headlines, or event listings. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators used \"November 25th,\" which is the standard way to write the date in English, including the ordinal suffix \"-th.\" This is appropriate and natural in most contexts, especially in formal or written English.\nThe second and fifth translators used \"November 25\" without the ordinal suffix. While this is grammatically acceptable in some informal contexts, it is less common in formal writing and may appear less polished compared to the version with the \"-th.\"\nThe fourth translator also used \"November 25th,\" aligning with the most natural and standard form.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"November 25th,\" as it is the most standard and natural way to express the date in English, with the ordinal suffix included. This format is widely used in both formal and informal contexts and is consistent with English date conventions.\n\nThe original Chinese text announces the renewal of a five-year currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), with an increase in the agreement's scale from 4,000 billion yuan (4,700 billion HKD) to 5,000 billion yuan (5,900 billion HKD). \n**Review of the translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Correctly identifies the PBOC and HKMA, and uses \"scale\" appropriately. However, the figures are off by a factor of 10—4,000 billion yuan is 4 trillion yuan, not 4,000 billion. This is a critical numerical error.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which is imprecise. Also, the figures are again off by a factor of 10 (400 billion instead of 4,000 billion).\n3. **Third junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"scale.\" However, the figures are again off by a factor of 10.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" appropriately. However, the figures are still off by a factor of 10.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" appropriately. The figures are accurate (400 billion RMB = 4,700 billion HKD). This is the most accurate translation so far.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"size\" appropriately. However, the figures are off by a factor of 10 (4,700 billion HKD instead of 470 billion HKD).\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nThe most accurate translation is the fifth one, which correctly uses \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" and provides the correct numerical values. However, the phrase \"the agreement’s size has been expanded\" is slightly less formal than \"the scale of the agreement has been expanded,\" which is more commonly used in financial contexts. Additionally, the original text uses \"人民銀行\" and \"金管局,\" which should be translated as \"the People's Bank of China (PBOC)\" and \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" respectively.\n**Improved translation:**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the renewal of a five-year currency swap agreement. The scale of the agreement has been expanded from the original RMB 4,000 billion (HK$4,700 billion) to RMB 5,000 billion (HK$5,900 billion).\n\n# Banking System\n\n# February 21\n\nThe original text discusses regulatory measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) in response to the pandemic, allowing non-face-to-face sales of specific insurance products and the review of sandbox schemes involving such sales.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate but lacks specificity by not naming HKMA explicitly. It uses \"Insurance Authority (Insurance Authority)\" redundantly and repeats \"without face-to-face meetings\" unnecessarily.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version correctly names HKMA and IA, uses \"non-face-to-face methods\" effectively, and includes \"sandbox scheme\" accurately. However, \"ease restrictions\" is slightly vague and less precise than \"facilitative measures.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate, using \"remotely\" as a synonym for non-face-to-face. However, it omits the parenthetical \"(IA)\" after \"Insurance Authority,\" which may be necessary for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is well-structured, uses \"in light of the pandemic\" effectively, and avoids repetition by using \"non-face-to-face means\" once. It is clear and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"non-face-to-face channels\" and \"such means\" effectively. However, it reverses the order of HKMA and IA, which may be less conventional.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very close to the best, using \"non-face-to-face methods\" and \"sandbox proposals\" accurately. However, \"sandbox proposals\" may be slightly less precise than \"sandbox schemes.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should clearly name both regulatory bodies, use precise terminology, avoid redundancy, and maintain a natural flow. \"Sandbox schemes\" is more standard than \"sandbox proposals.\" \"Non-face-to-face means\" is concise and appropriate. Including \"(IA)\" after \"Insurance Authority\" adds clarity. \"In light of the pandemic\" is a natural and formal expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) have introduced temporary facilitative measures in light of the pandemic, allowing the sale of specific insurance products through non-face-to-face means, and are collaborating to review sandbox schemes involving authorized institutions selling insurance products through non-face-to-face means.\n\n# March 16th\n\nThe original Chinese sentence is concise and formal, conveying a regulatory change in the countercyclical capital buffer ratio by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, terminology, and grammatical structure that affect fluency and precision.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"will be reduced\" to reflect the future action, and \"effective immediately\" is a standard phrasing in regulatory announcements. However, it omits the acronym \"HKMA,\" which may be less familiar to some readers.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"has been lowered\" and \"will take effect immediately.\" The use of the present perfect tense (\"has been lowered\") is slightly less direct than the simple future tense used in the first translation. The phrase \"will take effect immediately\" is also correct but slightly less formal than \"effective immediately.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the second, with the same tense and phrasing. The phrase \"taking effect immediately\" is a participle phrase that is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"effective immediately.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"countercyclical buffer capital ratio\" instead of \"countercyclical capital buffer ratio,\" which is a minor but notable difference in terminology. The phrase \"taking effect immediately\" is also used, which is slightly less formal than \"effective immediately.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the fourth, with the same terminology and phrasing. It also uses \"taking effect immediately.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the first, using \"has been lowered\" and \"effective immediately.\" It includes the full name of the authority but omits the acronym \"HKMA.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be both accurate and natural in tone, using standard regulatory language. The use of \"effective immediately\" is more formal and commonly used in official announcements than \"will take effect immediately\" or \"taking effect immediately.\" Additionally, including the acronym \"HKMA\" alongside the full name enhances clarity for readers who may be familiar with the abbreviation.\nThe term \"countercyclical capital buffer ratio\" is the more standard and precise term in financial regulation, as opposed to \"countercyclical buffer capital ratio\" or \"countercyclical buffer capital ratio.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced that the countercyclical capital buffer ratio applicable to Hong Kong has been reduced from 2.0% to 1.0%, effective immediately.\n\n# March 26\n\nThe original Chinese text outlines a collaborative initiative by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Social Welfare Department, and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association to assist social security beneficiaries in mainland China during the pandemic by enabling them to receive aid remotely without returning to Hong Kong.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"social security beneficiaries\" and \"remote channels\" appropriately. However, \"Banking Association\" is repeated unnecessarily in parentheses, which could be streamlined.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"social welfare beneficiaries\" is slightly different from the original, which uses \"social security,\" but it's a minor variation. The phrase \"through remote channels during the pandemic\" is slightly awkwardly placed.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically sound. However, \"allowances or subsidies\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"援助金或津貼\" (assistance or subsidies), and the placement of \"through remote channels\" at the end is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"financial assistance or allowances\" and \"epidemic\" instead of \"pandemic.\" While \"epidemic\" is technically correct, \"pandemic\" is more commonly used in this context. \"HKAB\" is an abbreviation that may not be widely recognized without explanation.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is very close to the first translation. It uses \"social security beneficiaries\" and \"remote channels\" effectively. However, the repetition of \"Banking Association\" in parentheses is redundant.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"social security recipients\" and \"remotely\" effectively. The use of \"the Association\" in parentheses is slightly unclear without prior context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use terminology that aligns with the original. It should avoid redundancy, use widely recognized terms, and ensure clarity. \"Social security beneficiaries\" is more precise than \"social welfare beneficiaries\" in this context. \"Pandemic\" is more appropriate than \"epidemic\" for describing the current situation. The term \"remote channels\" is clear, but \"remotely\" is more concise. The abbreviation \"HKAB\" should be spelled out on first use unless it is widely known.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the Social Welfare Department and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, has introduced measures to enable social security beneficiaries residing in mainland China to receive their assistance or subsidies remotely, without needing to return to Hong Kong in person during the pandemic.\n\n# April 17th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations all use \"April 17th,\" which is the standard and most natural way to express the date in English. The second and sixth translations include a \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the date is being used as a heading or title in a list or document, but it is not necessary in a standalone context. The fourth translation uses \"April 17\" without the \"th\" ordinal suffix, which is less formal and may be acceptable in some contexts, but \"April 17th\" is more complete and standard.\nThe best translation would be \"April 17th,\" as it is the most natural and standard way to express the date in English without unnecessary symbols or omissions.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the banking sector, has announced the launch of the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme to support small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers.\n\n# April 20\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 4月20日,\" where the \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or label. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English. The first and sixth translators used \"April 20,\" while the second, third, fourth, and fifth used \"April 20th.\"\nStrengths and weaknesses of the translations:\n- The use of \"April 20\" is concise and commonly used in formal or written contexts, especially in titles or headings. It is grammatically correct and aligns with the format of the original text, which uses a simple number without the \"th\" suffix.\n- The use of \"April 20th\" is also grammatically correct but adds the ordinal suffix \"th,\" which is more common in spoken English or informal writing. However, in the context of a heading or label, the \"th\" is often omitted for brevity and clarity.\nCultural and stylistic considerations:\n- In English, dates in headings or labels are typically written without the ordinal suffix, especially in formal or professional contexts. For example, calendars, schedules, and document headings often use \"April 20\" rather than \"April 20th.\"\n- The \"#\" symbol in the original text suggests that this is a heading or label, which further supports the use of a concise format without the \"th\" suffix.\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate translation would be \"April 20,\" as it is concise, aligns with the format of the original text, and is commonly used in similar contexts.\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company) has begun accepting applications for its \"100% Guarantee Special Loan\" under the \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme.\"\n\n# April 24\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 4月24日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English, but there are notable differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first and second translations simply write \"April 24\" without any ordinal indicator (\"th\"), which is acceptable in informal contexts but may lack the precision of including the ordinal suffix. The third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"April 24th,\" which is more precise and commonly used in formal or written English. The fourth translation includes the \"#\" symbol, mirroring the original format, but the use of \"24th\" with the \"#\" may be unnecessary or inconsistent with standard English conventions.\nThe best translation should maintain the clarity and precision of the original while adhering to standard English formatting. Including the ordinal suffix \"th\" adds clarity, and omitting the \"#\" symbol is preferable unless it is explicitly required for formatting purposes. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"April 24th.\"\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of the \"2020年銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則\" (2020 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules). The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in formality, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Translation 1** is concise and uses \"gazetted,\" which is the correct legal term in English for the formal publication of regulations. However, it omits the year \"2020\" from the title, which is important for clarity and specificity.\n**Translation 2** uses \"published in the official gazette,\" which is a more verbose and less formal phrasing than \"gazetted.\" While \"official gazette\" is accurate, the use of \"published\" is less precise than \"gazetted\" in legal contexts.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1 but includes the year \"2020\" in the title, which improves clarity and specificity. This is a stronger version.\n**Translation 4** uses quotation marks around the title, which is unnecessary in formal legal notices. It also uses the present tense \"are gazetted,\" which is less appropriate than the past tense \"have been gazetted\" for a completed action.\n**Translation 5** uses \"published\" instead of \"gazetted,\" which is less precise in legal terminology. It is otherwise accurate and clear.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Regulations\" instead of \"Rules,\" which may be incorrect depending on the original legal terminology. It also includes \"Banking Industry\" instead of \"Banking,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original term.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct legal terminology (\"gazetted\"), include the year in the title for clarity, and maintain a formal tone. It should also avoid unnecessary punctuation and use the past perfect tense to indicate a completed action.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe 2020 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules have been gazetted.\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局因應疫情設立專責查詢服務，協助「預先批核還息不還本」計劃客戶**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurately captures the structure and key terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is the correct name. Also, \"Advance Approval of Interest Payment Without Principal Repayment\" is overly wordy and not idiomatic in English.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the authority as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" which is concise and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Plan\" is less precise than \"scheme\" in this context, and \"customers\" is slightly less formal than \"clients.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the authority and uses \"Principal-Repayment-Only Loan Scheme.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Misinterprets the original term \"還息不還本\" as \"Principal-Repayment-Only,\" which is the opposite of the intended meaning. The original refers to paying only interest, not principal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the authority and uses \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Payment\" which is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"plan\" instead of \"scheme\" and \"customers\" instead of \"clients.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the authority and uses \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Payment\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"customers\" instead of \"clients\" and \"scheme\" is more appropriate than \"plan.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the authority and uses \"pre-approval interest-only repayment\" which is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The structure \"to assist clients under the... plan in response to the pandemic\" is slightly awkward and less direct than the original.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name: **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**.\n- Use the correct term for the scheme: **\"pre-approved interest-only repayment\"** or **\"pre-approved interest-only payment\"**.\n- Use **\"scheme\"** rather than \"plan\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use **\"clients\"** rather than \"customers\" for a more formal and appropriate tone.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is clear and direct, reflecting the original intent: **setting up a service in response to the pandemic to assist clients of a specific scheme**.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has set up a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist clients of the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme.\n\n# May 7th\n\nThe original Chinese text is:  \n**香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）推出的「定息按揭試驗計劃」開始接受申請。**\n### Review of the Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the core message and uses \"Fixed Rate Mortgage Trial Scheme\" as a direct translation of 「定息按揭試驗計劃」.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation\" instead of the correct company name, \"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited.\" Also, the parenthetical \"(Mortgage Corporation)\" is misleading and inconsistent with the official name.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the company as \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC)\" and uses \"Pilot Scheme\" for 「試驗計劃」, which is more natural in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Still uses \"Mortgage Corporation\" instead of \"Mortgage Securities Limited,\" which is the official name of the company.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company)\" and translates 「試驗計劃」 as \"Pilot Program,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Pilot Program\" instead of \"Pilot Scheme,\" which is slightly less common in financial contexts, though still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage Trial Scheme\" and correctly identifies the company as \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC).\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, uses \"Mortgage Corporation\" instead of the full and correct name, \"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Fixed Interest Mortgage Pilot Program\" and correctly identifies the company as \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (Mortgage Corporation).\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Fixed Interest\" is not the standard term in mortgage contexts; \"Fixed Rate\" is more commonly used. Also, the company name is still incorrect.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (Mortgage Securities Company)\" and \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage Pilot Program.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The parenthetical \"(Mortgage Securities Company)\" is redundant and could be omitted for clarity.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the **official English name** of the company: **\"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited\"**.\n- Use the **standard financial terminology**: \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage\" is more common than \"Fixed Interest Mortgage\" or \"Fixed Rate Mortgage.\"\n- Use **\"Pilot Scheme\"** or **\"Pilot Program\"** for 「試驗計劃」, both are acceptable, but \"Pilot Scheme\" is more commonly used in formal announcements.\n- Ensure **clarity and conciseness** in the sentence structure.\n### Final Translation:\n**Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited has begun accepting applications for its \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage Pilot Scheme.\"**\n\n# May 8th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing a consultation document regarding a mandatory background check program aimed at reducing the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a history of misconduct.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"authorized institutions\" and \"record of misconduct,\" which are appropriate. However, \"consultation document\" is slightly less formal than \"consultation paper,\" which is commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"licensed institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions.\" While both terms are similar, \"authorized institutions\" is more precise in the context of the HKMA, which regulates authorized institutions in Hong Kong. \"History of misconduct\" is slightly more natural than \"record of misconduct.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the first, with \"hiring\" instead of \"employing.\" Both are acceptable, but \"employing\" is more formal and commonly used in regulatory documents.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"consultation paper\" and \"scheme\" instead of \"program,\" which are both appropriate. \"Mitigate\" is a stronger and more formal verb than \"reduce,\" which is suitable for regulatory language. \"History of misconduct\" is also more natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" (FSMA), which is not the correct name for the HKMA. This is a critical error. It also uses \"licensed institutions\" and \"mitigate,\" which are both acceptable, but the incorrect authority name undermines the translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very close to the first, using \"authorized institutions\" and \"record of misconduct.\" It also uses \"consultation document\" and \"employing,\" which are appropriate. However, it lacks the formality of \"consultation paper\" and \"scheme.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"consultation paper\" instead of \"consultation document\" for formality and accuracy in regulatory contexts. It should use \"authorized institutions\" to reflect the correct terminology used by the HKMA. \"History of misconduct\" is more natural than \"record of misconduct.\" The verb \"mitigate\" is stronger and more appropriate in formal regulatory language than \"reduce.\" Finally, the correct name of the authority, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" should be used.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued a consultation paper on the implementation of a mandatory background check scheme to mitigate the risk of authorized institutions hiring individuals with a history of misconduct.\n\n# May 22\n\nThe original Chinese text is concise and formal, referring to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its publication of a report on bank culture self-assessment. The goal is to convey this information accurately and professionally in English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"comprehensive report titled\" effectively. However, \"providing the industry with a series of practices for reference\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The phrase \"a range of practices to consider\" is slightly less precise than \"for reference\" and may not fully capture the original intent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but omits \"Hong Kong\" from \"Monetary Authority,\" which could be misleading. The phrase \"providing the industry with a series of practices for reference\" is similar to the first translation and is acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the first translation, with the same strengths and minor wordiness in the latter part.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is more precise in the title, using \"Banks’ Self-Assessment of Banking Culture,\" which better reflects the original Chinese. However, it is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Similar to the third, it omits \"Hong Kong\" from \"Monetary Authority\" and uses \"issued\" instead of \"published\" or \"released,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use a concise and natural title for the report.\n- Employ clear and professional language that reflects the formal tone of the original.\n- Avoid redundancy and wordiness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has published a comprehensive report titled \"Review of Self-Assessment of Bank Culture,\" offering the industry a range of practices for reference.\n\n# May 29th\n\nAmex Insurance Company, AIA Insurance Company, AmTrust Insurance Company, Prudence Insurance Company, and Zhèngbǎo Insurance Company are all names of insurance companies, but the original text does not specify which one. Therefore, translating the name of the company is speculative and not accurate. The original text only mentions “按證保險公司,” which should be translated as “Anzen Insurance Company” or left in the original Chinese if the company name is not well known in English.\nThe term “八成及九成信貸擔保產品” is translated as “80% and 90% Credit Guarantee Products” or “80% and 90% loan guarantee products.” While both are acceptable, “credit guarantee products” is more commonly used in financial contexts.\nThe term “中小企融資擔保計劃” is translated as “Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme” or “SME Financing Guarantee Program.” Both are acceptable, but “Scheme” is more commonly used in British English, while “Program” is more common in American English. Since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is more commonly associated with British English, “Scheme” may be more appropriate.\nThe phrase “即時生效” is translated as “take effect immediately” or “are effective immediately.” Both are correct, but “take effect immediately” is more commonly used in formal announcements.\nThe translations by the junior translators have some inconsistencies in the company name, the use of “Scheme” versus “Program,” and the phrasing of “take effect immediately” versus “are effective immediately.” Additionally, some translations use “loan guarantee products” instead of “credit guarantee products,” which is less precise in this context.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the company name should be translated as “Anzen Insurance Company” based on the original Chinese. The term “credit guarantee products” should be used instead of “loan guarantee products.” The term “Scheme” should be used instead of “Program” to be consistent with the British English context. The phrase “take effect immediately” should be used instead of “are effective immediately” for consistency with formal announcements.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nAnzen Insurance Company announced the optimization measures for the \"80% and 90% Credit Guarantee Products\" under the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" which take effect immediately.\n\n# June 4th\n\nThe original text announces a joint initiative by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the banking industry to provide recent university graduates with short-term employment and professional training during the pandemic. The junior translators have all captured the core message, but there are variations in terminology, fluency, and precision.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using “Banking Industry Talent Launch Programme” and “short-term employment opportunities.” However, “Launch Programme” may not be the most precise term for a structured initiative.\n**Translation 2** uses “Banking Talent Start-up Scheme,” which is slightly less precise than “Launch Programme” or “Activation Program.” The term “Start-up Scheme” may imply a new business initiative rather than a talent development program.\n**Translation 3** uses “Banking Talent Start-up Program,” which is similar to Translation 2 and may not fully capture the intent of the original. It is, however, fluent and grammatically sound.\n**Translation 4** uses “Banking Industry Talent Activation Program,” which is more precise and aligns well with the original term “起動計劃” (activation plan). The structure is also clear and natural.\n**Translation 5** uses “Banking Talent Programme” and “epidemic,” which is less preferred in formal English than “pandemic.” It is also missing the full name of the HKMA.\n**Translation 6** uses “Monetary Authority” instead of “Hong Kong Monetary Authority,” which is incomplete. It also uses “Banking Sector Talent Activation Program,” which is close but slightly less precise than “Banking Industry Talent Activation Program.”\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use the full name of the HKMA: “Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).”\n- Use “pandemic” instead of “epidemic” for consistency with global terminology.\n- Use “Banking Industry Talent Activation Program” to accurately reflect “銀行業人才起動計劃.”\n- Use “recent university graduates” for clarity and precision.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is natural and fluent in English.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the launch of the “Banking Industry Talent Activation Program” in collaboration with the banking industry, providing recent university graduates with short-term job opportunities and professional training during the pandemic.\n\n# June 30\nThe original text is a simple date, \"6月30日,\" which translates directly to \"June 30\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, though there are minor variations in formatting.\nThe first, second, third, and sixth translators all used \"June 30th,\" which is grammatically correct in English when referring to a specific date. However, in many contexts—especially in headlines, titles, or when listing dates in a formal or neutral tone—\"June 30\" without the ordinal suffix is more commonly used and is considered more concise and natural.\nThe fourth and fifth translators used \"#June30\" and \"# June 30,\" respectively. These formats include a hashtag, which is typically used in social media contexts or for tagging purposes. Since the original text does not include a hashtag, adding one may be culturally inappropriate unless the context explicitly requires it, such as in a social media post or a campaign.\nIn summary, the most natural and accurate translation would be \"June 30,\" as it is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns with standard English conventions for expressing dates in formal or neutral contexts.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the publication of a white paper on green and sustainable banking, which outlines initial regulatory considerations for addressing climate-related issues. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, specificity, and adherence to the original tone.\nTranslation 1 is clear and concise, using \"initial framework\" and \"regulatory approach\" effectively. However, it omits the full name of the authority (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\") in the first mention, which may be less formal than required for official announcements.\nTranslation 2 correctly includes the full name of the authority in parentheses and uses \"initial thoughts\" and \"regulatory guidelines.\" However, \"guidelines\" may not fully capture the more formal tone of \"regulatory approach\" or \"regulatory framework.\"\nTranslation 3 is accurate and uses \"initial concepts\" and \"regulatory framework,\" which are appropriate. However, it lacks the parenthetical clarification of the authority's full name, which may be important for clarity in formal contexts.\nTranslation 4 uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which could be misleading. It also uses \"supervisory approach,\" which is slightly less precise than \"regulatory approach\" in the context of banking regulation.\nTranslation 5 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency,\" which is not the correct name of the authority. This is a significant error that misrepresents the source organization.\nTranslation 6 is accurate, includes the full name of the authority, and uses \"preliminary thoughts\" and \"regulatory approach.\" It is the most precise and formal of the translations, though \"preliminary thoughts\" may be slightly less formal than \"initial framework\" or \"initial concepts.\"\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the full name of the authority on first mention, with the acronym in parentheses.\n- Use \"regulatory framework\" or \"regulatory approach\" to reflect the formal nature of the document.\n- Use \"initial framework\" or \"preliminary concepts\" to convey the exploratory nature of the white paper.\n- Ensure the translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate for an official announcement.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a Green and Sustainable Banking White Paper, outlining the initial framework for the regulatory approach to addressing climate-related matters.\n\n# July 10\n\nThe original Chinese sentence is:  \n**金管局就加強監管信託業務的建議諮詢業界。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Services and Markets Commission is consulting with the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust services.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses formal and accurate terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly identifies the entity as the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is not the correct name for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This is a factual error.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA is consulting the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the entity as HKMA and uses concise language.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Trust business\" is slightly less precise than \"trust services\" or \"trust activities,\" and the phrase \"proposals to strengthen\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is consulting the industry on proposals to enhance the regulation of trust business.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the entity and uses \"enhance\" as a synonym for \"strengthen,\" which is natural in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Trust business\" is still not the most precise term in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is consulting the industry on proposed measures to strengthen the regulation of trust businesses.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"measures\" instead of \"proposals,\" which is more formal and appropriate in regulatory contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Trust businesses\" is plural and may not be the best fit if the original refers to the general category of trust services.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is consulting the industry on its recommendations to enhance the regulation of trust services.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"recommendations\" and \"trust services,\" which are both accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"its recommendations\" implies that the HKMA has already made recommendations, which may not be the case in the context of a consultation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Authority is consulting the industry on the proposal to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"proposal\" and \"trust business.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Authority\" is not the correct name for the HKMA, and \"the proposal\" is less natural than \"proposals\" or \"measures.\"\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the entity as the **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**.\n- Use **\"trust services\"** or **\"trust activities\"** rather than \"trust business\" for precision.\n- Use **\"proposed measures\"** or **\"proposals\"** to reflect the consultative nature of the process.\n- Maintain **formal and natural English** without unnecessary wordiness.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is consulting the industry on proposed measures to strengthen the regulation of trust services.\n\n# July 31st\nThe original text is a simple date: # 7月31日. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate, though there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe first, second, third, and fourth translators used \"July 31st\" with the \"st\" suffix, which is appropriate in English for dates. The fifth translator used \"July 31\" without the ordinal suffix, which is also acceptable but slightly less formal. The sixth translator used \"July 31\" without the ordinal suffix and omitted the \"#\" symbol, which is not necessary in English date formatting.\nThe most natural and standard English format for a date like this would be \"July 31st\" with the ordinal suffix. The use of the \"#\" symbol is not standard in English date formatting and appears to be a direct carryover from the original Chinese format, which uses \"#\" to denote a heading or section. Therefore, it is best to omit the \"#\" symbol in the English translation.\nThe best possible translation would be \"July 31st,\" which is both grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate in English.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on streamlined arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\n\n# August 5th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 8月5日\". The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly as \"August 5th\" or \"August 5\". However, there are a few nuances to consider.\nFirst, the use of the hashtag \"#\" in the original text is notable. It may indicate a heading or a label, such as in a calendar or a list of dates. Some translators included the hashtag in their translations, while others omitted it. Including the hashtag is more faithful to the original format, especially if the context implies it's part of a structured list or title.\nSecond, the date format in English can vary. \"August 5th\" is the ordinal form, which is commonly used in English-speaking countries. \"August 5\" is also acceptable, particularly in more formal or written contexts. However, \"August 5th\" is more natural in informal or conversational English.\nThird, the consistency of the translations is important. While most translators used \"August 5th,\" some used \"August 5,\" which may be less consistent with the ordinal form used in the original Chinese date format (5日, where \"日\" implies a day, and the ordinal is often expressed in English with \"th\").\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be to retain the hashtag and use the ordinal form \"August 5th\" to maintain consistency with the original format and natural English usage.\n\nThe original Chinese text is a formal announcement regarding a policy extension by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the banking sector. The goal is to extend the repayment period for trade financing loans under a specific repayment plan.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is incorrect. The correct entity is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The term \"Pre-Approved Principal and Interest Repayment Plan\" is awkward and not commonly used in financial contexts.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism. The phrase \"pre-approved interest-only repayment without principal repayment plan\" is redundant and awkwardly worded.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism. The term \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan\" is concise and accurate, though the original Chinese mentions \"還息不還本\" which is more precisely \"interest-only repayment without principal repayment.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" which is appropriate. The term \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Repayment Plan\" is slightly off from the original, which uses \"預先批核\" (pre-approved), not \"pre-approval.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism. The term \"90-day Repayment Holiday Scheme for Pre-approved Loans\" is a creative but less precise translation of the original, which is more about extending the repayment period, not a holiday.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** Correctly identifies the HKMA and the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism. The term \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan\" is accurate and concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name for the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Accurately reflect the term \"預先批核還息不還本計劃\" as \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan.\"\n- Clearly state that the repayment period is being extended by 90 days.\n- Use formal and precise language appropriate for a policy announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the banking sector, announced the extension of the repayment period for trade financing loans under the Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan by 90 days.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about regulatory guidance provided by two authorities regarding the use of video conferencing in the sale of long-term insurance products. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are differences in terminology, formality, and precision.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Insurance Authority,\" which is appropriate for formal contexts. It uses \"collaborated\" and \"guidance,\" which are standard in regulatory contexts. However, it uses \"using video conferencing to sell\" which is slightly less direct than \"selling... via video conferencing.\"\n**Translation 2** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is not the correct name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This is a significant error, as it misidentifies the regulatory body.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, but uses \"through video conferencing\" instead of \"using video conferencing to sell.\" It also omits the \"(HKMA)\" abbreviation, which may be less precise in formal contexts.\n**Translation 4** uses \"jointly issued guidelines\" instead of \"provided guidance,\" which is slightly more formal and precise. \"Guidelines\" is a common term in regulatory contexts, and \"via video conferencing\" is appropriate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without the \"Hong Kong\" qualifier, which may be ambiguous. It also uses \"collaborate\" in the present tense, which is less appropriate for a completed action.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 1, but includes the \"(IA)\" abbreviation for Insurance Authority, which adds clarity in formal writing.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Insurance Authority (IA)\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"guidelines\" instead of \"guidance\" for regulatory documents.\n- Use \"via video conferencing\" for conciseness and clarity.\n- Use the past tense \"have collaborated\" to indicate a completed action.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) have jointly issued guidelines to the industry on the regulatory requirements for selling long-term insurance products via video conferencing.\n\n# August 20th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) relaxing countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans, specifically increasing the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap from 40% to 50% for general cases. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation Review:**\n- **Translation 1** is clear and accurate, using \"loan-to-value ratio\" and \"cap\" appropriately. However, it uses \"applicable to these loans\" which is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the hyphen in \"macro-prudential.\" This is a minor stylistic choice and does not affect meaning.\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"eligible loans\" instead of \"non-residential property mortgage loans,\" which may mislead readers.\n- **Translation 4** is accurate and concise, with a slightly more natural flow than Translation 1. It avoids redundancy by not repeating \"for these loans.\"\n- **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 4, with the only difference being the use of \"such loans\" instead of \"these loans.\" Both are acceptable, but \"such loans\" may be slightly more formal.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio limit\" and \"upper limit\" instead of \"cap,\" which is acceptable but slightly less common in financial contexts. It is still clear and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, concise, and use standard financial terminology. It should avoid redundancy and ensure that the subject (HKMA) is consistently referenced. The term \"loan-to-value ratio\" is more commonly used than \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio limit\" in financial contexts, and \"cap\" is more concise than \"upper limit.\" The use of \"non-residential property mortgage loans\" is more precise than \"non-residential properties\" or \"non-residential property mortgages.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans, increasing the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap. The cap for general cases has been raised from 40% to 50%.\n\n# September 2nd\n\nTo alleviate the financial pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Hongkong and Shanghai Insurance Company Limited announced that the application period for the principal repayment deferral measures under the “80% and 90% Credit Guarantee Products” of the “SME Financing Guarantee Scheme” will be extended by six months, to March 31, 2021.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal news headline announcing the extension of a financial relief plan. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and accuracy.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but \"repaying interest but not principal\" is slightly awkward and less idiomatic than alternatives like \"interest-only repayment.\"\n**Translation 2** uses \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism for the Banking Industry,\" which is slightly wordy and not the most natural phrasing. \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" is concise and accurate.\n**Translation 3** incorrectly refers to \"Principal Repayment Deferral,\" which misrepresents the original plan. The original plan allows for repayment of interest only, not deferral of principal repayment.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Principal Payment Holiday Scheme,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term. The original plan is about interest-only repayment, not a holiday on principal payments.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 1 and is also slightly awkward with \"repaying interest but not principal.\"\n**Translation 6** is the most detailed and accurate in terms of terminology, using \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Payment Without Principal Repayment,\" which closely mirrors the original Chinese. However, it is somewhat wordy.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"interest-only repayment\" as it is a standard financial term.\n- Use \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" without unnecessary qualifiers.\n- Ensure the term \"pre-approved\" is used consistently and accurately.\n- Use \"extension\" without \"another\" unless the original emphasizes the additional period.\n**Best possible translation:**\nOn the same day, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" plan for six months until April 30, 2021.\n\n# September 4th\nThe original text is a simple date heading, \"# 9月4日,\" which translates to \"September 4th\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, with only minor variations in formatting.\nStrengths of the translations:\n- All translations correctly identify the date as \"September 4th.\"\n- The use of \"September 4th\" is grammatically correct and commonly used in English-speaking countries.\nWeaknesses of the translations:\n- The use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is not typically used in English date formats. While it may be used in some contexts (e.g., social media, lists), it is not standard in formal or written English.\n- The translations by the second and fourth junior translators use \"# September 4\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less common in formal writing and may be considered less precise.\nImprovements:\n- The best approach is to omit the \"#\" symbol, as it is not standard in English date formatting.\n- Using \"September 4th\" is the most natural and precise way to express the date in English.\n- Ensuring consistency in the use of ordinal suffixes (\"th\") is important for clarity and correctness.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is \"September 4th.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing a notice requiring banks to implement enhanced disclosure measures, specifically providing \"double prompts\" to retail and SME customers applying for unsecured loans and credit card products via digital platforms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"dual prompts\" and \"digital platforms.\" However, \"retail individual customers\" is slightly redundant, as \"retail customers\" already implies individuals.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"dual authentication,\" which is a misinterpretation of \"double prompts.\" \"Authentication\" implies verification, not a warning or reminder, making this translation inaccurate in meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"double reminders\" is acceptable, though \"reminders\" may not fully capture the regulatory intent of \"dual prompts.\" The translation is otherwise accurate and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very similar to the third, but uses \"retail personal customers\" instead of \"retail individual customers,\" which is more natural in English. The use of \"double reminders\" is also acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"dual notifications,\" which is slightly less precise than \"dual prompts.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The use of \"double warnings\" is problematic, as \"warnings\" implies a negative or cautionary message, which may not align with the regulatory intent of \"dual prompts.\" The translation is otherwise accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name of the authority (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), accurately reflect the term \"dual prompts\" (which likely refers to a regulatory requirement for double confirmation or disclosure), and use natural, fluent English. \"Dual prompts\" is the most accurate term in this context, as it implies a procedural requirement rather than a reminder or warning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice requiring banks to implement enhanced disclosure measures, providing \"dual prompts\" to retail personal customers and small and medium-sized enterprise customers applying for unsecured loans and credit card products through digital platforms.\n\n# September 18\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of clarity, fluency, and consistency with official terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the scheme as \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" or its variations.\n- The key elements—maximum loan amount based on 12 months of salaries and rent, or HK$5 million, whichever is lower, and the repayment period extended to 5 years—are consistently included.\n- The use of \"HKD\" or \"HK$\" is appropriate, though \"HK$\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The name of the loan program is translated differently: \"100% Guaranteed Loan,\" \"100% Guarantee Preferential Loan,\" \"100% Guarantee Concessionary Loan,\" and \"100% Guarantee Special Loan.\" The official term is likely \"100% Guaranteed Loan\" or \"100% Guaranteed Special Loan,\" and consistency is important for clarity.\n- **Structure and Flow:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the maximum loan amount for the '100% Guaranteed Loan' for each enterprise has been increased to the sum of 12 months of employee salaries and rent,\" which could be more concise.\n- **Prepositions and Word Choice:** The use of \"under\" versus \"of the\" in structuring the scheme and its components can affect readability. For example, \"Under the '100% Guarantee Preferential Loan' scheme of the 'Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme'\" is unnecessarily wordy.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the most commonly accepted term for the loan program, likely \"100% Guaranteed Loan.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the structure of the sentence, using \"under the 'SME Financing Guarantee Scheme'\" as the primary clause.\n- Use \"HK$\" instead of \"HKD\" for consistency with official documents.\n- Simplify phrasing for better flow and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nUnder the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" the maximum loan amount for the \"100% Guaranteed Loan\" for each enterprise has been increased to the sum of 12 months' employee salaries and rent, or HK$5 million, whichever is lower; the maximum repayment period has been extended to 5 years.\n\n# September 29\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) publication of a report on enhancing anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulation through the use of data and regulatory technology, as part of its digitalization initiative. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology, structure, and tone that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the core message of the report.\n- The use of terms like \"risk-based AML and CTF regulation\" is consistent across translations, which is crucial for clarity in regulatory contexts.\n- The inclusion of \"digitalization initiative\" or \"digitalization plan\" is appropriate and aligns with the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The title of the report varies slightly between translations. Some use \"Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,\" while others use \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing.\" The original uses “打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監管,” which more precisely translates to \"Regulation of Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.\" The most accurate title would be \"Regulation of Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Digital Innovation Era.\"\n- Some translations use \"supervision\" instead of \"regulation,\" which is a minor but notable difference. In the context of financial regulation, \"regulation\" is more commonly used than \"supervision\" when referring to legal frameworks and oversight.\n- The phrase \"as part of its digitalization initiative\" is repeated in most translations, which is acceptable but could be slightly rephrased for variety and fluency.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use a more precise title that reflects the original wording.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, particularly between \"regulation\" and \"supervision.\"\n- Slightly vary the phrasing of the final clause to enhance fluency and avoid repetition.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a report titled \"Regulation of Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Digital Innovation Era,\" outlining how it will strengthen the application of data and regulatory technology in its risk-based anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation as part of its digitalization initiative.\n\n# September 30\n\nThe original sentence is concise and professional, focusing on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sharing key observations and good practices with the industry regarding a specific inspection program related to retail banks' sales of investment and insurance products.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, but \"disguised customer check program\" is slightly awkward. \"Disguised\" may not be the best term to describe a covert inspection program. Also, the structure \"regarding its disguised customer check program on the sale...\" is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"undercover customer inspection program,\" which is more natural than \"disguised.\" \"Best practices\" is a more standard term than \"good practices\" in professional contexts. The sentence is clear and concise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and well-structured. However, \"disguised customer inspection program\" is still not the most natural phrasing. Also, the placement of \"with the industry\" at the end is slightly less direct than other versions.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"mystery shopper inspection program,\" which is a commonly used term in the industry for such programs. \"Key findings\" is slightly different from \"key observations,\" but it's still acceptable. The sentence is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most polished version. It uses \"mystery shopper program,\" which is the most accurate and commonly used term. It also uses \"key findings and best practices,\" which are standard in professional reporting. The structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" This is a factual error and would mislead the reader. The rest of the translation is accurate and natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for the authority (HKMA), use the most accurate and commonly accepted term for the inspection program (\"mystery shopper program\"), and use professional terminology such as \"key findings\" and \"best practices.\" It should also be concise and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) shared its key findings and best practices from the mystery shopper program concerning the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks with the industry.\n\n# November 2nd\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, lists, or headings. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are technically correct but differ slightly in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use \"November 2nd\" without any additional formatting. This is a standard and natural way to express the date in English and is appropriate for most contexts.\nThe second, fifth, and fourth translations include a \"#\" symbol before the date. This may be appropriate if the date is being used as a heading or label in a list, such as in a calendar or numbered list. However, the use of \"#\" is not standard in formal writing and may be unnecessary unless the context specifically requires it.\nThe second and fifth translations use \"# November 2\" without the \"nd\" suffix. While this is grammatically acceptable in informal contexts, the \"nd\" is more precise and commonly used in English to denote the ordinal position of the day.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"November 2nd\" without any additional formatting, as it is the most natural and standard way to express the date in English. If the \"#\" symbol is required for formatting purposes, it should be used consistently and appropriately based on the context. However, since the original text does not include any formatting, the most accurate and natural translation is simply \"November 2nd.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward news headline announcing the extension of an application period for a mortgage-related program. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and grammatical precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Mortgage Securities Company\" and \"Trial Program.\" The use of \"until\" is slightly less common in such announcements, where \"to\" is more standard. The term \"Trial Program\" is acceptable but \"Pilot Program\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Mortgage Securities Company\" and \"Pilot Program.\" The use of \"its\" is appropriate, and \"to\" is the correct preposition. This translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Omits the article \"the\" before \"Mortgage Securities Company,\" which is grammatically incorrect in English. Otherwise, the translation is accurate and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"mortgage-backed securities company,\" which is a more precise term but may be overly technical for a general announcement. The use of \"Pilot Program\" and \"to\" is correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Fixed Rate Mortgage\" without a hyphen, which is less standard. Also uses \"until\" instead of \"to,\" which is less common in such contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Mortgage Corporation\" instead of \"Mortgage Securities Company,\" which may be inaccurate if the original term is specific. Also uses \"Trial Scheme\" instead of \"Pilot Program,\" which is less standard in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct and most commonly accepted term for the company: \"Mortgage Securities Company.\"\n- Use \"Pilot Program\" as it is the standard term in such contexts.\n- Use the preposition \"to\" when indicating a specific end date.\n- Maintain proper grammar, including the use of the definite article \"the\" before the company name.\n- Avoid overly technical or ambiguous terms unless necessary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Mortgage Securities Company announced that the application period for the \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage Pilot Program\" will be extended by one year to October 30, 2021.\n\n# November 3rd\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 11月3日,\" where the \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or label. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, second, sixth, fourth, and fifth translators all used \"November 3rd,\" which is the correct and most natural way to express the date in English. However, the fourth and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original format. The third translator used \"November 3,\" which is grammatically correct but lacks the ordinal indicator \"rd,\" making it slightly less natural in formal or written English contexts.\nThe best translation should preserve the original format, including the \"#\" symbol, while using the correct and natural English date format. Therefore, the most accurate and appropriate translation would be \"# November 3rd.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introducing a two-year plan to encourage local banks to adopt compliance technology, as outlined in a white paper. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and fluent, using \"compliance technology\" and \"white paper\" appropriately. However, it uses \"formulated,\" which is slightly formal and less commonly used in this context.\nTranslation 2 uses \"RegTech,\" which is a more concise and commonly used term in the financial industry. However, it incorrectly refers to the authority as the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the HKMA.\nTranslation 3 is accurate and uses \"compliance technology\" and \"white paper\" correctly. However, it uses \"included in\" instead of \"outlined in,\" which is slightly less precise.\nTranslation 4 is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"initiative\" instead of \"plan,\" which is a more natural term in this context. It also uses \"HKMA\" in parentheses, which is appropriate for clarity. The use of \"as outlined in\" is also more precise than \"contained in\" or \"included in.\"\nTranslation 5 is very similar to Translation 1, but it uses \"contained in\" instead of \"outlined in,\" which is slightly less precise.\nTranslation 6 is incorrect in referring to the authority as the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" and uses \"RegTech\" instead of \"compliance technology,\" which may be less clear to some readers.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"initiative\" instead of \"plan,\" include the acronym \"HKMA\" in parentheses for clarity, and use \"as outlined in\" to accurately reflect the original text. It would also use \"compliance technology\" instead of \"RegTech\" to ensure clarity for all readers.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a two-year initiative to promote the adoption of compliance technology in the local banking sector, as outlined in a white paper titled \"Leveraging the Power of Compliance Technology: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching an updated cyber defense initiative, emphasizing its alignment with technological trends and global risk management practices to enhance the banking sector's cyber defenses.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, but it uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is not the correct name of the organization. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the entity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Cyber Resilience Assessment 2.0\" instead of \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0.\" However, \"Cyber Resilience Assessment\" may not be the exact name of the program, and \"resilience\" may not fully capture the intent of \"防衛\" (defense).\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct name for the authority. It uses \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" with British spelling, which is acceptable but may not be the official name. The phrasing is natural and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"HKMA\" without the full name, which is acceptable in context. It uses \"enhancing\" instead of \"elevating,\" which is slightly less formal but still correct. The term \"Defense Program\" is used, which is consistent with the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct name for the authority. It uses \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" with British spelling and \"elevating\" to describe the enhancement of capabilities. The use of \"banking industry\" instead of \"banking sector\" is slightly different but still acceptable.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses the correct name for the authority. It uses \"enhancing\" instead of \"elevating,\" which is slightly less formal but still correct. The term \"Defense Plan\" is used, which is consistent with the original.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name of the organization (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"), use the exact name of the program as presented in the original text (\"網絡防衛計劃2.0\" → \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\"), and maintain a balance between formality and clarity. The verb \"elevating\" is more formal and better suited to the context of a regulatory authority. Additionally, \"banking sector\" is more commonly used in such contexts than \"banking industry.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the launch of the \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\" to reflect the latest trends in technological development and incorporate the latest global practices in cyber risk management, thereby elevating the banking sector's cyber defense capabilities to a higher level.\n\n# December 15\n\nWith the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Hong Kong Bankers' Association and the Deposit-taking Companies Association jointly issued the \"Guidelines on Banking Services for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities,\" outlining recommended principles and best practices to provide banking services to clients in need.\n\n# December 18th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor inconsistencies in formatting.\nThe first, second, sixth, and fifth translators have provided \"December 18th\" or \"December 18\" without the \"#\" symbol. While \"December 18th\" is the most grammatically correct and natural way to express the date in English, \"December 18\" is also acceptable, though slightly less formal.\nThe third and fourth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which is appropriate if the date is being used as a heading or section title. However, the fourth translator wrote \"December 18\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less standard in formal English writing.\nThe best translation would retain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading, and use \"December 18th\" for clarity and formality. This format is widely recognized and used in English-speaking contexts for dates.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching a new unit under the Banking Professional Qualifications Framework, specifically focused on \"business operations risk management,\" with the goal of promoting talent development and enhancing professional capabilities in the banking sector.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, but it uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. Also, \"aiming to promote\" is slightly less direct than \"to promote.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is more precise by specifying \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"module\" instead of \"unit,\" which is more commonly used in educational or training contexts. The phrase \"talent development\" is slightly more natural than \"talent training.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes the full name of the authority (HKMA) in parentheses. However, \"Operational Risk Management in Business Operations\" is a bit wordy and may not be the exact title used in the original. The phrase \"industry professionals\" is slightly broader than \"practitioners.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate, using \"module\" and \"professionalism\" instead of \"professional capabilities.\" However, it omits the specific focus on \"business operations,\" which is part of the original title.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the authority as the \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is not the correct name. It also uses \"Business Operation Risk Management\" with a lowercase \"p\" in \"Operation,\" which is inconsistent with the original. The term \"banking employees\" is less formal than \"practitioners.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is awkward in structure, using \"unit on 'business operations risk management'\" instead of a more natural phrasing. It also uses \"employees\" instead of \"practitioners\" and lacks the full name of the authority.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full and correct name of the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Accurately reflect the title of the unit: \"Business Operations Risk Management.\"\n- Use \"module\" instead of \"unit\" for consistency with educational\/training frameworks.\n- Use \"talent development\" or \"talent training\" as appropriate, with \"talent development\" being more natural in this context.\n- Use \"practitioners\" or \"professionals\" to maintain a formal and professional tone.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the launch of the \"Business Operations Risk Management\" module under the Banking Professional Qualifications Framework to promote talent development in the banking sector and enhance the professional capabilities of practitioners.\n\n# December 23\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing guidance to banks on two key areas: offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels and simplifying investment product disclosures for non-retail bank clients who are familiar with investments.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"non-face-to-face channels\" and \"non-retail bank customers who are familiar with investments.\" However, \"HKMA\" is abbreviated without full form, which may be less formal.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"sophisticated investor clients\" instead of \"non-retail bank customers who are familiar with investments.\" While \"sophisticated investors\" is a common term in finance, it may not be as precise as the original, which emphasizes familiarity rather than sophistication.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the first, with the same strengths and weaknesses. It uses \"non-retail banking customers\" which is slightly more verbose than \"non-retail bank customers.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very close to the best of the group. It uses \"non-retail banking clients\" and \"simplifying investment product disclosures,\" which is slightly more natural than \"simplifying the disclosure of investment products.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is concise and accurate. It uses \"non-retail bank customers who are familiar with investments\" and \"simplifying product disclosure,\" which is slightly more concise than the original but still clear.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" This is a critical error, as it misidentifies the regulatory body. It also uses \"non-retail bank clients with investment knowledge,\" which is slightly less precise than \"familiar with investments.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"non-retail bank customers who are familiar with investments\" to accurately reflect the original.\n- Use \"simplifying investment product disclosures\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for regulatory guidance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels and on simplifying investment product disclosures for non-retail bank customers who are familiar with investments.\n\n# December 31st\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) publication of a consultation summary regarding proposed rules to suspend termination rights in financial contracts for authorized institutions, under section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance (Chapter 628), and the subsequent consultation with the industry on the draft rules.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and concise, but it omits the reference to the public consultation and the fact that the consultation summary was published *after* the consultation. It also lacks the specific reference to \"section 92\" in the Ordinance.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is more comprehensive, including the reference to section 92 and the fact that the consultation summary was published *after* the public consultation. However, the sentence structure is somewhat convoluted, and the phrase \"is seeking industry feedback\" is imprecise, as the consultation has already occurred.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes all necessary details, including the reference to section 92 and the consultation process. However, the phrase \"published a consultation summary on the public consultation\" is slightly redundant and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and includes all key elements, such as the reference to section 92, the form of subsidiary legislation, and the fact that the HKMA sought industry feedback. However, the structure is slightly awkward, particularly in the first sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes all necessary details, including the reference to section 92 and the consultation process. However, the phrase \"proposed public consultation regarding the establishment of rules\" is slightly wordy and could be more direct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and includes all key elements, such as the reference to section 92, the form of subsidiary legislation, and the consultation with the industry. However, the phrase \"issued a summary of the public consultation\" is slightly less precise than \"published a consultation summary.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly convey that the HKMA published a consultation summary *after* conducting a public consultation on its proposal to establish rules under section 92 of the Ordinance. It should also specify that the rules are to be established in the form of subsidiary legislation and that the HKMA sought industry feedback on the draft rules. The sentence structure should be clear and concise, avoiding redundancy and ensuring that all key legal references are included.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a consultation summary following a public consultation on its proposal to establish, under section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance (Chapter 628), rules suspending the termination rights of financial contracts applicable to authorized institutions in the form of subsidiary legislation. The HKMA also sought industry feedback on the draft rules.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe original Chinese text is a concise title: \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\". The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are several nuances and stylistic considerations to refine the translation.\nStrengths of the translations include the accurate use of \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center,\" which directly reflects the original meaning. However, there are a few areas for improvement:\n1. **Capitalization**: The use of \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" is inconsistent. In English, titles typically follow title case, where major words are capitalized. However, in this case, since it's a short title, it may be more natural to use sentence case, especially if it's not a formal heading.\n2. **\"Centre\" vs. \"Center\"**: The original Chinese uses \"中心\" (zhōngxīn), which is commonly translated as \"center\" in American English and \"centre\" in British English. Since the context is international and the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is more commonly associated with British English, \"centre\" might be more appropriate. However, \"center\" is also widely understood and used globally.\n3. **Punctuation and Formatting**: The use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or tag, but in the translations, it is either omitted or retained. Since the original includes the \"#\", the most accurate translation would also include it unless instructed otherwise.\n4. **Consistency**: Translators 2, 3, and 6 provided identical translations, which is good for consistency, but they all used \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" and \"Center\" with a \"C,\" which may not be the most natural choice for a title.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be:\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\nThis version includes the \"#\" symbol to match the original, uses \"Centre\" to align with British English conventions (which is more common in Traditional Chinese contexts), and uses \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" to reflect the title case style often used in headings.\n\n# January 22\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese for marking specific dates, often in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are technically correct but differ slightly in style and formatting.\nThe first, fifth, and fourth translations use \"January 22\" without the \"nd\" suffix. This is a common and acceptable format in English, especially in more formal or written contexts. The second, third, and sixth translations use \"January 22nd,\" which is also correct and often preferred in informal or spoken contexts. The fourth translation also includes the \"#\" symbol, which matches the original Chinese format, suggesting it may be used as a heading or title.\nThe key considerations in choosing the best translation are consistency with the original format and appropriateness for the intended use. Since the original includes a \"#\" symbol, it may be appropriate to retain this in the English version if it serves a similar function (e.g., as a heading or section marker). However, in many English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used with dates unless it is part of a specific formatting convention.\nGiven that the original is likely a heading or title, the most appropriate translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use the standard English date format. Therefore, the best translation would be \"# January 22\" or \"# January 22nd,\" depending on the preferred style. Since \"January 22\" is more commonly used in formal writing and headings, it is the more natural choice in this context.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terms of fluency, grammatical consistency, and precision in terminology. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"aimed at exploring\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less idiomatic than \"aimed to explore.\" It also correctly uses \"central bank digital currency (CBDC)\" with the acronym in parentheses, which is good for clarity.\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"aimed to explore\" and avoids the parenthetical explanation of CBDC. It is slightly more concise and natural in flow.\n3. **Translation 3** uses the plural \"central bank digital currencies\" which is not standard in this context. The singular \"central bank digital currency\" is more appropriate. It also uses \"aims to study\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less consistent with the past tense used in the first sentence.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"released\" instead of \"published,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation. It also uses \"aims to explore,\" which is consistent with the first sentence's tense.\n5. **Translation 5** uses the present perfect \"have announced\" which is not appropriate here, as the action is completed and in the past. It also uses the plural \"central bank digital currencies\" again, which is incorrect.\n6. **Translation 6** is concise and uses \"aims to study,\" but it omits the phrase \"on central bank digital currency\" after \"project,\" which slightly reduces clarity.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The verb tense should be consistent. Since the announcement and publication are completed actions, the simple past tense (\"announced,\" \"published\") is appropriate.\n- The term \"central bank digital currency\" should be used in the singular, as it refers to a specific concept, not multiple currencies.\n- The phrase \"aimed to explore\" is more idiomatic and consistent with the past tense.\n- The use of em dashes or parentheses should be consistent and appropriate for the context.\n- The term \"project\" is more natural than \"initiative\" in this context, though both are acceptable.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would maintain the past tense, use the singular form of \"central bank digital currency,\" and ensure clarity and fluency in the sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand announced the results of their joint research project on central bank digital currency — the \"Inthanon-LionRock\" project — and published a research report. The project aimed to explore the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments.\n\n# February\n\nThe original text provides factual information about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) being appointed to a leadership role within the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), along with a brief description of the FATF's role and location. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"Co-Chair\" appropriately. The term \"global organization responsible for setting anti-money laundering standards\" is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"standard-setting body\" is more concise and professional. The only minor issue is the omission of \"Hong Kong\" in the first sentence, which could be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the HKMA.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Policy Development and Compliance Group\" instead of \"Assessment and Compliance Subgroup.\" This is a significant error, as it misrepresents the actual subgroup the HKMA was appointed to. The term \"combating money laundering\" is slightly more active than \"anti-money laundering,\" but it is still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The term \"Evaluation and Compliance Group\" is not accurate. The correct term is \"Assessment and Compliance Subgroup.\" The phrase \"organization that sets global standards to combat money laundering\" is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation omits \"Hong Kong\" in \"Monetary Authority,\" which could be misleading. It also uses \"Assessment and Compliance Group\" instead of \"Subgroup,\" which is less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as it misidentifies the organization. The rest of the translation is accurate and well-written.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use the correct term: \"Assessment and Compliance Subgroup.\"\n- Use precise and professional terminology, such as \"standard-setting body.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n- Avoid misrepresenting the organization or its role.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority was appointed as Co-Chair of the Assessment and Compliance Subgroup under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), with a two-year term from 2020 to 2022. The Financial Action Task Force is the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering, headquartered in Paris, France.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe original Chinese text is a concise title: \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\". The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are several nuances and stylistic considerations to refine the translation.\nStrengths of the translations include the accurate use of \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center,\" which directly reflects the original meaning. However, there are a few areas for improvement:\n1. **Capitalization**: The use of \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" is inconsistent. In English, titles typically follow title case, where major words are capitalized. However, in this case, since it's a short title, it may be more natural to use sentence case, especially if it's not a formal heading.\n2. **\"Centre\" vs. \"Center\"**: The original Chinese uses \"中心\" (zhōngxīn), which is commonly translated as \"center\" in American English and \"centre\" in British English. Since the context is international and the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is more commonly associated with British English, \"centre\" might be more appropriate. However, \"center\" is also widely understood and used globally.\n3. **Punctuation and Formatting**: The use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or tag, but in the translations, it is either omitted or retained. Since the original includes the \"#\", the most accurate translation would also include it unless instructed otherwise.\n4. **Consistency**: Translators 2, 3, and 6 provided identical translations, which is good for consistency, but they all used \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" and \"Center\" with a \"C,\" which may not be the most natural choice for a title.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be:\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\nThis version includes the \"#\" symbol to match the original, uses \"Centre\" to align with British English conventions (which is more common in Traditional Chinese contexts), and uses \"Status\" with a capital \"S\" to reflect the title case style often used in headings.\n\n# May 5th\n# 5月5日\nThe original text is a simple date heading, \"5月5日,\" which translates directly to \"May 5th\" in English. The junior translators have all captured the literal translation correctly, but there are nuances and formatting considerations that could be improved.\nStrengths of the translations:\n- All translations correctly identify the date as \"May 5th.\"\n- The use of the ordinal \"5th\" is appropriate for English date formatting.\nWeaknesses of the translations:\n- The original text includes a hashtag (#) before the date, which is not reflected in all translations. The second and sixth junior translators included the hashtag, which is more consistent with the original format.\n- The use of \"May 5th\" is correct, but in some contexts, \"May 5\" (without the ordinal) may be preferred, especially in more formal or international settings. However, \"May 5th\" is also widely accepted and natural in English.\nCultural and formatting considerations:\n- In English, dates can be written in several formats, such as \"May 5,\" \"5 May,\" or \"May 5th.\" The choice depends on regional preferences and context. In the United States, \"May 5th\" is common, while in the UK, \"5 May\" is often used.\n- The hashtag (#) is commonly used in digital or social media contexts to denote a topic or event. If the original text is intended for such a context, retaining the hashtag is appropriate.\nImproved translation:\nThe best translation would retain the hashtag and use the ordinal form \"May 5th\" to match the original's structure and maintain clarity and consistency with the source.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會共同發起綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately identifies the two organizations and the purpose of the group.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is the correct name. Also, \"cross-sector supervisory group\" is slightly off; \"cross-institutional\" or \"inter-agency\" is more precise in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organizations and uses \"Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance,\" which is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"launched\" instead of \"initiated,\" which is slightly less precise than \"initiated\" in the context of forming a group.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organizations and uses \"Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"initiated\" instead of \"launched,\" which is slightly less common in this context, though still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organizations and uses \"cross-institutional oversight group,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Oversight group\" is slightly less precise than \"steering group\" in this context, which implies a more strategic and advisory role.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"cross-institutional steering group,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Securities and Futures Ordinance Review Committee\" instead of the \"Securities and Futures Commission.\" This is a critical error.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies the organizations and uses \"Cross-agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance,\" which is natural and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"launched\" instead of \"initiated,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct names of the organizations: **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)** and **Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)**.\n- Use the correct term for the group: **Inter-Agency Steering Group** or **Cross-agency Steering Group**.\n- Use the most appropriate verb: **initiated** is more precise than **launched** in the context of forming a new group.\n- Ensure the phrase **\"on Green and Sustainable Finance\"** is correctly placed and capitalized.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission jointly initiated the Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance.\n\n# May 20\n\nThe original text is a concise news headline announcing the publication of the first applied financial research report by a Hong Kong-based institution. The translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and institutional naming.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The title is well translated as \"Adoption and Innovation of Financial Technology in the Hong Kong Banking Sector.\" The use of \"Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" is appropriate.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** The translation is also accurate, with a slight variation in the name of the institution: \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" instead of \"Institute.\" The use of \"Banking Industry\" is acceptable, though \"Banking Sector\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This is nearly identical to the first translation, with the same strengths and no notable weaknesses.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate, with the use of \"FinTech\" instead of \"Financial Technology,\" which is a more modern and commonly used term in the industry. The title is slightly more concise. However, \"applied finance research report\" is slightly less precise than \"applied financial research report.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation has a minor issue with the phrase \"research report applying financial research,\" which is awkward and unclear. It should be \"applied financial research report\" instead. The use of \"Fintech\" is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate, with the use of \"Fintech\" and \"Banking Industry.\" However, the name of the institution is slightly different: \"Centre for Financial and Monetary Research\" instead of \"Institute for Monetary and Financial Research.\" This may be a minor issue depending on the official name of the institution.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the most accurate and commonly accepted name of the institution, as well as modern and precise terminology. \"Fintech\" is more concise and widely used in the industry than \"Financial Technology.\" The phrase \"applied financial research report\" is more precise than \"applied finance research report.\" Additionally, \"Banking Sector\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"Banking Industry.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research has published its first applied financial research report, titled \"Fintech Adoption and Innovation in the Hong Kong Banking Sector.\"\n\n# June 29\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the People's Bank of China and the Monetary Authority of Macao, issued a joint announcement announcing the pilot program for the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\n# August 3\nThe original text is a simple date heading, \"# 8月3日,\" which translates to \"August 3\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, though there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify the month and day.\n- The use of \"August 3rd\" is grammatically correct in British English, though \"August 3\" is more common in American English.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations mirrors the original format, which may be appropriate if the heading is meant to be a title or label.\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of \"August 3rd\" is unnecessarily formal and less commonly used in modern English, especially in headings or titles.\n- The repetition of \"August 3rd\" across multiple translations suggests a lack of critical evaluation of style and context.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations may not be necessary unless it serves a specific formatting purpose.\nImprovements:\n- Use \"August 3\" for simplicity and consistency with modern English conventions.\n- Omit the \"#\" symbol unless it is required for formatting or stylistic reasons.\n- Ensure consistency in date formatting across the text.\nBased on this reasoning, the best translation would be \"August 3.\"\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局與國際結算銀行創新樞紐轄下香港中心推出「創科挑戰賽—貿易融資數碼化」。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"國際結算銀行\" as \"Bank for International Settlements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"創新樞紐轄下香港中心\" as \"Hong Kong Institute for Financial Innovation under the Bank for International Settlements,\" which misrepresents the structure. The \"Innovation Hub\" is a unit under BIS, and the \"Hong Kong Centre\" is a sub-unit under that hub.  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** Generally fluent, but the structure is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies \"BIS\" and uses \"Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"launched\" without a clear subject, which is grammatically incomplete. Also, \"Innovation Hub\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun.  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** The sentence is incomplete and lacks clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the structure: \"Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements\" and uses \"in collaboration with\" to show the partnership.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"InnoChallenge\" instead of the official name, which may not be appropriate. Also, \"Digitisation\" is British English; the original uses \"數碼化,\" which is more neutral.  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** Good, but the name abbreviation may be misleading.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies \"國際結算銀行\" as \"International Settlement Bank,\" though the official name is \"Bank for International Settlements.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Tech Innovation Challenge\" instead of the official \"創科挑戰賽,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Innovation and Technology Challenge\" or \"Innovation Challenge.\"  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** The translation is fluent but uses an incorrect name for BIS.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"BIS Innovation Hub\" and \"Innovation and Technology Challenge.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Innovation and Technology Challenge\" is slightly wordy compared to the original.  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** Good, but the title could be more concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FinTech Challenge\" which is a common term in financial innovation contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"FinTech\" may not fully capture the meaning of \"創科\" (innovation and technology), and \"Digitisation\" is British English.  \n   - **Fluency & Grammar:** The translation is fluent but may not fully align with the original's intent.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the structure: \"金管局\" (HKMA) and \"國際結算銀行創新樞紐轄下香港中心\" (Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements).\n- Use the official name of BIS: \"Bank for International Settlements.\"\n- Use the official event name: \"創科挑戰賽—貿易融資數碼化\" (Innovation and Technology Challenge – Digitalization of Trade Finance).\n- Use American English spelling (e.g., \"digitization\" instead of \"digitisation\").\n- Maintain clarity and fluency.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements have launched the \"Innovation and Technology Challenge – Digitalization of Trade Finance.\"\n\n# August 19\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Governor's participation in the 25th Meeting of the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), with the first session held via video conference and the second session on November 16, also via video conference.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is grammatically correct but overly wordy and repetitive. The phrase \"Executives' Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)\" is awkward and redundant. The term \"Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA)\" is incorrect; the correct body is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This translation is more concise and accurate. It correctly identifies the HKMA Governor and uses \"Senior Officials' Meeting\" for the EMEAP. However, \"Senior Officials' Meeting\" may not be the exact term used in EMEAP's official nomenclature.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but includes a redundant \"Meeting\" in \"Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\" Also, \"hosted\" is less formal than \"chaired\" or \"presided over,\" which are more appropriate for a formal meeting.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The term \"Executive Directors' Meeting\" is not standard for EMEAP. The phrase \"Central Bank Conference\" is also not the correct term. The use of \"video\" instead of \"video conference\" is less formal and less precise.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly identifies the HKMA Governor, uses \"Heads of Central Banks of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EMEAP)\" which is a precise and formal term, and maintains consistency in the use of \"via video conference.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the fifth, but it uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which is incorrect for the HKMA. Also, \"16th\" should be \"16\" without the \"th\" when used in a date in a formal context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the title and role of the HKMA Governor, use the correct and formal name for the EMEAP meeting, and maintain consistency in the use of formal language and terminology. It should also avoid redundancy and ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority chaired the first session of the 25th Meeting of the Heads of Central Banks of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EMEAP) via video conference. The second session of the meeting was held via video conference on November 16.\n\n# August 21st\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in calendars, headings, or titles. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation that could affect the clarity and professionalism of the translation.\nThe first, second, third, and sixth translators used \"August 21st\" with slight variations in the use of the \"#\" symbol. The fourth and fifth translators used \"August 21\" and \"# August 21st,\" respectively. While all translations are technically correct, the use of the \"#\" symbol is not standard in English date formatting unless it is part of a specific heading or title format.\nThe most natural and standard English format for a date in this context would be \"August 21st\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is a standalone date and not part of a list or heading that requires a symbol. The use of \"August 21\" is also acceptable but lacks the ordinal indicator (\"st\"), which is commonly used in English to denote the position in a sequence.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"August 21st,\" as it is the most natural and standard format in English for a standalone date.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement about the release of a research report by a Hong Kong-based institution. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the institution as the \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research\" and uses \"Application of Financial Studies Report,\" which is slightly awkward and not standard terminology. The title is accurate but could be more concise.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research\" and \"Applied Finance Research Report,\" which is more natural. The title \"A Transforming Regulatory and Compliance Landscape\" is well phrased, though \"regulatory and compliance\" is often used in reverse order in English.\n**Translation 3** has a minor error in \"Application Finance Research Report\" (should be \"Applied Finance Research Report\") and uses \"Changing Compliance and Regulatory Environment,\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"Evolving.\"\n**Translation 4** and **5** are very similar, using \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" and \"applied financial research report.\" The title is accurate, but \"Monetary and Financial\" is less common than \"Monetary and Financial Research\" as a proper noun.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Financial and Monetary Research Center\" and \"Applied Financial Research Report,\" which is slightly more natural. The title \"A Transforming Compliance and Regulatory Landscape\" is well phrased, though the order of \"compliance and regulatory\" is reversed from the original.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- The institution's name should be consistent and match the original Chinese, which is likely \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research.\"\n- \"Applied Financial Research Report\" is more standard than \"Application of Financial Studies Report.\"\n- The title should use \"Evolving Compliance and Regulatory Environment\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- The phrase \"published its second\" is more natural than \"has released its second.\"\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research published its second Applied Financial Research Report titled \"Application of Artificial Intelligence in Banking: Evolving Compliance and Regulatory Environment.\"\n\n# August 31\nThe original text is a simple date heading, written in Traditional Chinese as \"# 8月31日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first, fourth, and sixth translators used \"August 31\", while the second, third, fifth, and sixth used \"August 31st\". The second translator also included the \"#\" symbol, mirroring the original format.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in translating the date and the use of the \"#\" symbol by one translator. However, the use of \"August 31st\" is more common in American English, while \"August 31\" is more typical in British English. Since the original text does not specify a regional preference, either form is acceptable. However, the use of \"August 31st\" may be considered more precise in some contexts, as it explicitly denotes the ordinal nature of the date.\nThe inclusion of the \"#\" symbol by the second translator is a direct reflection of the original format, which may be appropriate if the \"#\" is used to denote a heading or section. However, in many English contexts, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used with dates unless it is part of a specific formatting convention.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"August 31\" as it is concise, clear, and widely understood in both British and American English. It also avoids the potential overuse of the \"#\" symbol unless it is specifically required by the context.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward legal statement regarding the implementation of a specific ordinance in Hong Kong. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing, terminology, and grammatical structure that affect the clarity and fluency of the translations.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses of the Translations:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"was implemented\" and \"in the form of a limited liability partnership.\" It is grammatically correct and clear, though \"was implemented\" may sound slightly passive compared to other options.\n  \n- **Translation 2** is nearly identical to Translation 1, except it uses \"Chapter\" instead of \"Cap.\" While both are acceptable, \"Cap.\" is more commonly used in legal contexts in Hong Kong, so it may be more appropriate.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"has been implemented\" and \"limited partnerships\" instead of \"limited liability partnerships.\" The use of \"has been implemented\" is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"came into effect\" or \"was implemented.\" Also, \"limited partnerships\" lacks the nuance of \"limited liability partnerships,\" which is a specific legal term.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"came into effect\" and \"limited partnerships.\" \"Came into effect\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in legal contexts. However, \"limited partnerships\" again omits the \"liability\" component, which is crucial in legal terminology.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"allows\" and \"as limited partnerships.\" The use of \"allows\" is slightly less formal than \"enabling\" or \"was implemented,\" and \"as limited partnerships\" is grammatically correct but less precise than \"in the form of limited liability partnerships.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the original, using \"allows\" and \"in the form of limited liability partnerships.\" However, \"allows\" is less precise than \"was implemented\" or \"came into effect\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use precise legal terminology, maintain a formal tone, and ensure grammatical accuracy. \"Came into effect\" is a more natural and commonly used phrase in legal contexts than \"was implemented\" or \"has been implemented.\" Additionally, \"limited liability partnerships\" is the correct and more precise term in this context, as it reflects the legal structure being described.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Chapter 637) came into effect, enabling investment funds to be established in Hong Kong in the form of limited liability partnerships.\n\n# November 2nd to 6th\nThe original text is a simple date range: # 11月2至6日. The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first, third, and fifth translations use \"November 2nd to 6th,\" which is grammatically correct and natural in English. The second and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original text but may not be necessary in English unless it is part of a specific formatting convention. The fourth and fifth translations use \"November 2 to 6,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less formal than using \"2nd\" and \"6th.\"\nThe most natural and fluent translation would be \"November 2nd to 6th,\" as it clearly indicates the full date range without unnecessary symbols or informal phrasing. This version is both grammatically correct and culturally appropriate for English-speaking audiences.\n\nThe original text discusses a collaborative event between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and an investment promotion body, highlighting its scale, the initiatives announced, and the goal of fostering a fintech ecosystem to support businesses, especially SMEs.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology. However, \"Investment Promotion Agency\" is not the correct name of the organization; it should be \"Investment Promotion Council\" or \"Invest Hong Kong.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Invest Hong Kong,\" which is the correct name of the organization. The term \"Business Data Connect\" is a direct translation of the Chinese term, but \"Commercial Data Link\" might be more natural. The structure is clear and fluent.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The use of \"Hong Kong Trade Development Council\" is incorrect; the correct name is \"Invest Hong Kong.\" The term \"Commercial Data Interchange\" is a bit awkward and less commonly used than \"Business Data Link.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Investment Promotion Council,\" which is not the correct name. \"Business Data Exchange\" is a plausible term but not the most commonly used. The structure is clear, but the organization name is incorrect.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This version correctly identifies the organization as the \"Investment Promotion and Development Bureau,\" which is not the standard name. However, it uses \"Business Data Link\" and \"Trade Link,\" which are more natural. The term \"foster a conducive ecosystem for fintech innovation\" is well phrased.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Investment Promotion Agency,\" which is not the correct name. It also uses \"Commercial Data Link,\" which is acceptable, but the structure is slightly less fluent than some other versions.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name of the organization, which is \"Invest Hong Kong.\" It should also use natural and commonly accepted terms for the initiatives, such as \"Business Data Link\" and \"Trade Link.\" The sentence structure should be clear and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"foster a favorable ecosystem\" or \"develop a conducive environment for fintech innovation.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Invest Hong Kong co-organized the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020,\" attracting over 1.2 million attendees from more than 130 economies. The event announced a series of initiatives, including the \"Business Data Link\" and the integration of \"Trade Link\" with the People's Bank of China's \"Trade Finance Blockchain Platform,\" aiming to foster a favorable ecosystem for fintech innovation to support the growth of various businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n# November 3rd\nThe original text is a simple date written in the format \"# 11月3日,\" where the \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or label. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, second, sixth, fourth, and fifth translators all used \"November 3rd,\" which is the correct and most natural way to express the date in English. However, the fourth and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original format. The third translator used \"November 3,\" which is grammatically correct but lacks the ordinal indicator \"rd,\" making it slightly less natural in formal or written English contexts.\nThe best translation should preserve the original format, including the \"#\" symbol, while using the correct and natural English date format. Therefore, the most accurate and appropriate translation would be \"# November 3rd.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about a jointly organized event between two governmental bodies. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the organizations, the nature of the event, and the format (online). \n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the event as the 4th \"Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue\" and specifies that it was \"jointly held online\" by the two organizations. The use of \"held\" is slightly less common than \"hosted\" in this context, but it is still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"co-hosted\" and \"in an online format,\" which are natural expressions. However, \"State Secretariat\" is not the standard term for the Swiss organization; \"Federal Secretariat\" is more appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"jointly hosted,\" which is a strong and natural verb choice. The structure is clear, and the placement of the modifier \"under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance\" is correct. However, \"Swiss Federal International Financial Secretariat\" is not the official name of the organization.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of content but uses \"organized\" instead of \"hosted,\" which is slightly less precise in this context. The phrase \"Secretariat for International Financial Affairs\" is correct, but the structure is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"co-hosted\" and \"Directorate for International Financial Matters,\" which is a correct term. However, \"Directorate\" may not be the exact equivalent of the original Chinese term, which refers to a \"Secretariat.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"co-hosted\" and correctly identifies the organization as the \"Secretariat for International Financial Affairs under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance.\" However, the use of \"is co-hosted\" implies an ongoing event, which may not be appropriate for a past event.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"co-hosted\" to reflect the joint nature of the event, include the correct name of the Swiss organization (\"Secretariat for International Financial Affairs\"), and clearly indicate that the event was held online. It should also use past tense to reflect that the event has already taken place.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 4th \"Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue\" was co-hosted online by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Secretariat for International Financial Affairs under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance.\n\n# November 9th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, second, fourth, and sixth translations all use \"November 9th,\" which is the standard way to write the date in English, including the ordinal suffix \"-th.\" This is grammatically correct and natural in English.\nThe third translation, \"November 9,\" omits the ordinal suffix, which is less common in formal or written English, though it may be acceptable in informal contexts or when space is limited.\nThe fifth translation, \"# November 9,\" retains the \"#\" symbol but omits the ordinal suffix. This is inconsistent with the original format, which includes the ordinal in the Chinese date format. However, the \"#\" symbol may be a stylistic choice or a formatting marker, so it's worth preserving if it's part of the intended structure.\nThe best translation should maintain the date format as it would appear in standard English while preserving any stylistic elements from the original, such as the \"#\" symbol. Including the ordinal suffix \"-th\" is more natural in English for written dates, and retaining the \"#\" symbol aligns with the original's formatting. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"November 9th\" with the \"#\" symbol if it is intended to be part of the heading or section title.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) signing a new partnership agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to promote the \"Green Banking Alliance\" and encourage Asian commercial banks to develop strategies and goals for a greener future.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the HKMA and IFC, and uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" without quotation marks, which is appropriate. However, it omits the term \"relevant\" before \"strategies and targets,\" which slightly weakens the nuance of the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" with quotation marks, which is slightly different from the original. It also includes \"more sustainable future,\" which is a valid synonym but slightly changes the emphasis from \"greener\" to \"sustainable.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct entity involved in the agreement.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It includes the IFC's acronym (IFC) and uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" without quotation marks. It also correctly uses \"develop strategies and set goals\" as in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original, using \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" with quotation marks and including \"relevant strategies and set targets.\" However, the term \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" may not be the exact name used in the original, which is \"Green Banking Alliance.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent, using \"Green Banking Alliance\" without quotation marks and including \"relevant strategies and goals.\" It is very close to the original in both structure and content.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, including the correct name of the authority (HKMA), the correct name of the alliance (\"Green Banking Alliance\"), and the appropriate use of terms like \"relevant strategies and goals.\" It should also be fluent and natural in English, avoiding unnecessary changes in emphasis or terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has signed a new partnership agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to promote the \"Green Banking Alliance\" and encourage Asian commercial banks to develop relevant strategies and set goals for a greener future.\n\n# November 16\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in headlines or titles. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with slight differences in formatting. The first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"November 16th,\" which is grammatically correct in English but less common in formal or journalistic contexts. The second, third, and sixth translations use \"November 16,\" which is more standard in such contexts.\nThe use of the hashtag (#) in the second translation is unnecessary unless the original text was intended for social media or a specific platform. The original text does not include a hashtag, so it should be omitted in the translation.\nThe most appropriate translation would be \"November 16,\" as it is concise, standard, and aligns with common date formatting in English. It avoids the use of the ordinal suffix \"th\" and the hashtag, both of which are not required in this context.\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行第七批零售通脹掛鈎債券(iBond)。\" is a straightforward statement about the issuance of a specific type of bond under a government program. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first translation, \"The seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) has been issued under the government bond program,\" is grammatically correct and fluent. However, it uses the present perfect tense (\"has been issued\"), which implies a connection to the present, which may not be appropriate if the issuance is a completed event in the past.\nThe second translation, \"The seventh tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) will be issued under the Government Bond Programme,\" uses \"tranche\" instead of \"batch,\" which is a more formal and commonly used term in financial contexts. However, the use of \"will be issued\" suggests a future event, which may not align with the original text's implication of a completed action.\nThe third translation, \"Issue the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the government bond program,\" is a direct translation that uses the imperative form. While grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance of a completed action and reads more like a command than a statement of fact.\nThe fourth translation, \"Issue of the seventh series of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the government bond program,\" uses \"series\" instead of \"batch\" or \"tranche.\" While \"series\" is acceptable, it is less precise in this context. The structure is also slightly awkward, as \"issue of\" is not the most natural phrasing in English.\nThe fifth translation, \"Issue the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBonds) under the government bond program,\" is similar to the third but uses \"iBonds\" with an \"s,\" which may be incorrect if \"iBond\" is a singular, branded term.\nThe sixth translation, \"The seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) is issued under the government bond program,\" uses the present tense (\"is issued\"), which may be misleading if the issuance is a past event. It is also less common to use the passive voice in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use \"tranche\" instead of \"batch\" for accuracy in financial terminology, use the past tense to reflect a completed action, and ensure that the term \"iBond\" is used consistently without unnecessary pluralization.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\n\"The seventh tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) was issued under the government bond program.\"\n\n# November 24\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding the publication of a research report by a Hong Kong-based institution. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. The title is correctly translated, and the structure is natural. However, \"Monetary and Financial Research Center\" may not be the official name of the institution, which could affect accuracy.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"Institute for Monetary and Financial Research,\" which may not match the official name. The use of \"its\" is appropriate, and the title is well translated. However, the name discrepancy could be an issue.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is very similar to the second, with the addition of \"Applied Financial Research Report\" in title case. The use of \"its\" is correct, and the title is well translated. However, the name of the institution may not be accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"Centre for Financial Studies,\" which is likely incorrect. The title is well translated, and the use of \"has released\" is appropriate. However, the name of the institution is questionable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version uses \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" and \"Robust Market Ecosystem.\" The title is well translated, and the structure is natural. However, the name of the institution may not be accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"Centre for Financial and Monetary Research,\" which may not be the official name. The title is well translated, and the structure is natural. However, the name discrepancy could affect accuracy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe key issues across all translations are the accuracy of the institution's name and the consistency of terminology. The term \"Applied Financial Research Report\" should be capitalized consistently if it is a proper noun. Additionally, \"Sound Market Ecosystem\" and \"Robust Market Ecosystem\" are both acceptable, but \"Sound\" may be more commonly used in formal contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre published its third Applied Financial Research Report titled \"The Hong Kong Green Bond Market: Building a Sound Market Ecosystem for Sustainable Growth.\"\n\n# November 27\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese for marking dates, often seen in calendars or headings. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are essentially correct in terms of content. However, there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe first and third translations use \"November 27\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is acceptable in many contexts, especially in formal or written English where the ordinal indicator is often omitted. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"# November 27\" or \"# November 27th,\" which includes a hashtag symbol. This may be appropriate if the date is being used in a social media or digital context, but it is not standard in formal writing. The fifth translation uses \"# November 27th,\" which is the only one to include both the hashtag and the ordinal indicator.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct. However, the use of the hashtag is not standard in formal English writing and may be unnecessary unless the context specifically requires it. The inclusion of \"th\" is also a matter of style—while it is common in spoken English and informal writing, it is often omitted in formal or written contexts.\nThe best possible translation would be a simple, clear, and standard representation of the date without unnecessary symbols or stylistic variations. Therefore, \"November 27\" is the most appropriate and natural translation for the given text.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been appointed as the Chair of the EMEAP Study Group on Resolution Mechanisms. This dedicated group provides support for knowledge sharing and discussion among regional authorities regarding cross-border resolution.\n\n# December 6th\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Chinese to denote a specific day. All junior translators have correctly translated the date as \"December 6th,\" which is accurate in terms of content. However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Formatting:** The original text includes a hashtag (#) before the date. While this is not standard in English date formatting, it may be used for stylistic or contextual reasons (e.g., in social media posts or headings). The sixth junior translator included the hashtag in the translation, which is a more faithful representation of the original format.\n2. **Fluency and Naturalness:** In English, dates are typically written without a hashtag unless it serves a specific purpose. Therefore, while \"December 6th\" is correct, the inclusion of the hashtag may be unnecessary unless the context requires it.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:** In English, the use of a hashtag before a date is not conventional. It may be more appropriate to omit it unless the context (e.g., a social media caption or a heading) explicitly requires it.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be to retain the hashtag if it is stylistically or contextually relevant, but otherwise, it is more natural to present the date without it. Since the original includes the hashtag, it is reasonable to include it in the translation as well, assuming it serves a specific purpose in the context.\n\nThe original text introduces a new feature of the Hong Kong fast payment system \"轉數快\" (FPS), which allows citizens to link their bank accounts using their Hong Kong ID numbers to receive payments from institutions. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"TransferFast\" as the English name for \"轉數快,\" which is not the official or commonly used name. The phrase \"enabling them to receive payments issued by institutions\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The name \"Zhangshu Kuai\" is a direct transliteration and not the official English name. The use of \"organizations\" instead of \"institutions\" is acceptable but less precise in a financial context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version correctly uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" as the official name. However, \"Faster Payment System\" is redundant since FPS is already the acronym. The phrase \"in order to receive funds disbursed by organizations\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most concise and accurate translation. It uses the correct name \"FPS\" and the phrase \"in order to receive payments issued by institutions\" is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version incorrectly uses \"Fast Payment System 'Faster Payment System'\" which is redundant and confusing. The rest of the translation is otherwise accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The name \"Quick Pay System 'Zhuanshuai'\" is not the official name. The use of \"residents\" instead of \"citizens\" is minor but acceptable. The phrase \"to receive payments issued by institutions\" is clear but could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the official English name of the system, which is \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS). It should also use natural, concise phrasing that reflects the intended meaning without redundancy. The phrase \"link their bank accounts to their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers through their banks\" is accurate but could be slightly rephrased for smoother flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe fast payment system \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) has launched a new feature allowing citizens to link their bank accounts to their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers through their banks, in order to receive payments issued by institutions.\n\n# December 14 to 15\nThe original text is a simple date range: \"12月14至15日,\" which translates to \"December 14 to 15.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with minor differences in formatting and the use of ordinal numbers (\"14th\" vs. \"14\").\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"December 14th to 15th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses ordinal numbers consistently.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** In English, it's more common to use \"14 to 15\" without the \"th\" when referring to a range of dates, especially in informal or general contexts. Using \"14th to 15th\" may sound overly formal or pedantic.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# December 14-15\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses a concise hyphen format, which is common in English for date ranges.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary unless it's part of a specific formatting requirement (e.g., a heading or hashtag). It may confuse readers or appear unprofessional in formal contexts.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# December 14 to 15\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the more natural \"to\" format and avoids the unnecessary \"#\" symbol.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"#\" symbol is still present, which is not standard in English date formatting.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"December 14 to 15\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a clear, concise, and natural translation. It uses the standard \"to\" format and avoids unnecessary symbols or ordinal numbers.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong candidate for the best translation.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"December 14 to 15\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the fourth translation, which is a clear and natural choice.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"December 14th to 15th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Consistent use of ordinal numbers.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** As noted earlier, the use of \"14th\" and \"15th\" is less common in English for date ranges and may sound overly formal.\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**  \nThe most natural and widely accepted format in English for a date range like this is \"December 14 to 15.\" It avoids unnecessary symbols like \"#\" and uses the standard \"to\" format, which is both clear and concise. The use of ordinal numbers (\"14th\" and \"15th\") is not required in this context and may be considered overly formal or pedantic. Therefore, the best translation is \"December 14 to 15.\"\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about a collaborative event organized by the Green Finance Center, which is part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The sentence includes specific names and titles that must be accurately translated to maintain clarity and professionalism.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies the Green Finance Center as established by the HKMA's Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office. However, \"co-hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"co-organized\" or \"co-hosted\" may imply a more active role in hosting than \"co-organized\" does.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"co-organized\" is appropriate, and \"Facilitation Office\" is a more precise term than \"Promotion Office.\" However, \"Conference\" may not be the most fitting term for the event described, which is more of a \"seminar\" or \"symposium.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Symposium,\" which is a more suitable term for a formal discussion event. However, \"Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for Infrastructure Financing Promotion\" is unnecessarily wordy and less commonly used than \"Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate. The use of \"IFC\" is acceptable in formal contexts, and \"co-organized\" is appropriate. However, \"Facilitation Office\" is more precise than \"Promotion Office.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation contains a critical error: it incorrectly states that the Green Finance Center was established by the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which is not the correct entity. This is a major inaccuracy that undermines the credibility of the translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. The use of \"Forum\" is appropriate, and the title of the office is correctly translated. However, \"Forum\" may be less specific than \"Seminar\" or \"Symposium\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, concise, and use appropriate terminology. It should correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, use the correct event name, and choose a term that accurately reflects the nature of the event (e.g., \"seminar,\" \"symposium,\" or \"forum\"). The use of \"co-hosted\" or \"co-organized\" is acceptable, but \"co-hosted\" may be more appropriate if the Green Finance Center played a central role in organizing the event.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Green Finance Centre, established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, co-hosted the inaugural \"International Finance Corporation Climate Business Network Seminar\" with the International Finance Corporation.\n\n# December 17\n<\/think>\nDecember 17\n\nThe original Chinese text discusses the release of a strategic plan by a cross-agency group focused on green and sustainable finance, with the goal of strengthening Hong Kong's financial ecosystem from six areas. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nThe first translation is concise and accurate, but uses \"proposing to strengthen\" which is slightly less formal than the original. The second translation uses \"has released\" and \"outlining six areas,\" which is more natural in English and conveys the plan's structure effectively. The third translation uses \"Inter-Agency Oversight Group,\" which may not be the most accurate term for the original Chinese \"跨機構督導小組.\" The fourth translation uses \"Steering Group\" and \"strategy plan,\" which is slightly inconsistent with the original term \"策略計劃.\" The fifth and sixth translations are very similar, using \"Steering Group\" and \"strategic plan,\" which are more consistent with the original Chinese.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to use the most accurate and natural English equivalents for the Chinese terms. \"Cross-Agency Steering Group\" is a more accurate translation of \"跨機構督導小組\" than \"Inter-Agency Oversight Group.\" \"Strategic plan\" is more consistent with \"策略計劃\" than \"strategy plan.\" Additionally, \"outlining six key areas\" is more natural and precise than \"proposing to strengthen... from six aspects.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Cross-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance has released a strategic plan for green and sustainable finance, outlining six key areas to strengthen Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# December 21st\n\nThe original sentence, \"轉數快付款功能擴展至政府繳費櫃枱及自助服務機,\" translates to a statement about the expansion of a fast payment feature to government payment counters and self-service machines. The junior translators have provided several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nThe first translation, \"The Quick Payment function has been extended to government payment counters and self-service kiosks,\" is concise and grammatically correct. However, \"kiosks\" may not be the most accurate term for \"自助服務機\" in this context, which more commonly refers to \"machines\" or \"terminals.\"\nThe second translation, \"The Fast Transfer Payment Function has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines,\" introduces \"Fast Transfer Payment Function,\" which is not a standard term and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the specific service.\nThe third translation, \"The Quick Payment function has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines,\" is very similar to the first but uses \"machines\" instead of \"kiosks,\" which is more appropriate for \"自助服務機.\"\nThe fourth translation, \"The fast payment function with high transaction speed has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines,\" adds unnecessary detail about \"high transaction speed,\" which is not present in the original text and may be redundant.\nThe fifth translation, \"The fast payment feature is now extended to government payment counters and self-service machines,\" is grammatically correct and uses \"feature\" instead of \"function,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less formal.\nThe sixth translation, \"The FPS payment feature has been expanded to government payment counters and self-service machines,\" uses \"FPS\" (which stands for Faster Payment System), a term that may be too specific or obscure for a general audience.\nConsidering these points, the best translation should be concise, accurate, and use standard terminology. It should avoid adding unnecessary details and use terms that are widely understood.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n\"The Quick Payment function has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\"\n\n# December 22nd\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 12月22日,\" where the \"#\" symbol may be used to denote a heading or a section marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English, but there are notable differences in formatting and consistency.\nThe first junior translator wrote \"December 22,\" using the ordinal form without the \"nd\" suffix. This is grammatically acceptable in informal contexts but less precise than using the full ordinal form.\nThe second, fourth, and fifth junior translators used \"December 22nd,\" which is the correct ordinal form in English and is more precise and formal.\nThe third junior translator included the \"#\" symbol in the translation as \"# December 22nd,\" which is consistent with the original format. However, in English, the use of \"#\" as a section marker is less common than in Chinese, where it is often used for headings or to denote specific entries.\nThe sixth junior translator wrote \"# December 22,\" which is similar to the third but omits the \"nd\" suffix, making it less precise.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should maintain the original format as closely as possible while ensuring grammatical correctness and cultural appropriateness in English. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"# December 22nd,\" which preserves the original structure and uses the correct ordinal form.\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行第五批銀色債券,\" translates to an announcement regarding the issuance of a specific batch of bonds under a government program. The junior translators have produced several versions, most of which are quite similar. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **Translation 1**: \"Issue the fifth batch of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Program.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate in meaning, uses \"batch\" which is appropriate for a numbered issuance, and capitalizes \"Silver Bonds\" and \"Government Bond Program\" as proper nouns.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None significant. It is clear and concise.\n2. **Translation 2**: \"Issue the fifth series of silver bonds under the government bond program.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct in meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"series\" instead of \"batch,\" which may be less precise in the context of government bond issuance. Also, lowercase \"government bond program\" may be less formal than needed.\n3. **Translation 3**: \"A fifth batch of silver bonds has been issued under the government bond program.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Grammatically correct and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses passive voice, which may be less direct than the active voice used in the other translations. Also, lowercase \"government bond program\" again.\n4. **Translation 4**: \"Issue the fifth batch of silver bonds under the government bond program.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 1, but with lowercase \"government bond program.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Lowercase may be less appropriate for a formal program name.\n5. **Translation 5**: Same as Translation 4.  \n   - **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Same as above.\n6. **Translation 6**: \"The fifth tranche of Silver Bonds is issued under the government bond program.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"tranche,\" which is a more formal and precise term in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses passive voice and lowercase \"government bond program.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement**:  \nThe most accurate and natural translation should use active voice, appropriate financial terminology, and proper capitalization for program names. \"Batch\" is acceptable, but \"tranche\" is more precise in financial contexts. \"Silver Bonds\" should be capitalized as a proper noun. \"Government Bond Program\" should also be capitalized as a formal program name.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nIssue the fifth tranche of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Program.\n\n# December 17, 21, and 22.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) led a delegation from the banking industry to hold an annual meeting with mainland financial regulators via video conference, discussing recent developments in both regions' financial sectors.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. However, it uses \"banking industry representatives\" instead of \"banking association,\" which is less specific and slightly less precise than the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is accurate and includes the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association,\" which adds clarity. It also uses \"financial sectors of both regions,\" which is natural and precise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the second, but it uses \"led a delegation from the Hong Kong Bankers' Association and held...\" which is slightly awkward in structure. The use of \"and held\" instead of \"in holding\" is less idiomatic.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate but uses \"Banking Association\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous. It also uses \"financial management departments\" instead of \"financial regulators,\" which is slightly less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"leading a delegation from the Banking Association\" and \"financial sectors on both sides,\" which are both idiomatic and precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is concise and accurate. However, \"banking association delegation\" is slightly vague without specifying \"Hong Kong.\" It also uses \"on both sides\" instead of \"in both regions,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be precise, natural, and culturally appropriate. It should include the full name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association for clarity. It should also use \"financial regulators\" rather than \"financial management departments\" to align with standard terminology. The phrase \"financial sectors of both regions\" is more natural than \"on both sides\" or \"in both regions.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) led a delegation from the Hong Kong Bankers' Association in holding an annual meeting with mainland financial regulators via video conference, discussing recent developments in the financial sectors of both regions.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\n# December 18th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have mostly captured the date correctly, but there are minor inconsistencies in formatting.\nThe first, second, sixth, and fifth translators have provided \"December 18th\" or \"December 18\" without the \"#\" symbol. While \"December 18th\" is the most grammatically correct and natural way to express the date in English, \"December 18\" is also acceptable, though slightly less formal.\nThe third and fourth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which is appropriate if the date is being used as a heading or section title. However, the fourth translator wrote \"December 18\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less standard in formal English writing.\nThe best translation would retain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading, and use \"December 18th\" for clarity and formality. This format is widely recognized and used in English-speaking contexts for dates.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局宣布會就作為政府「未來基金」部分的「香港增長組合」進行市場調查。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"market survey\" and correct structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Serves as a component of\" is slightly wordy and less direct than \"is part of.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and clear. Uses \"HKMA\" which is more efficient than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in repeated contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"On\" is slightly less formal than \"regarding,\" but still acceptable.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Good.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the second, with the same strengths and weaknesses.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Good.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"will serve as part of\" which is slightly more dynamic.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Will serve as\" implies a future action, but the original sentence uses \"作為\" (as), which is more about current status.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"market investigation\" instead of \"market survey,\" which is a synonym but slightly more formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Investigation\" may imply a more in-depth or formal inquiry than \"survey.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"market investigation.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"香港增長組合\" as \"Hong Kong Growth Fund\" instead of \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio.\" This is a critical error, as \"組合\" refers to a portfolio, not a fund.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Poor due to the mistranslation of the key term.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" for brevity and consistency.\n- Use \"market survey\" as it is the more commonly used term in this context.\n- Accurately translate \"香港增長組合\" as \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio.\"\n- Use \"is part of\" to reflect the current status, not a future action.\n- Maintain a formal yet clear tone appropriate for official announcements.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced that it will conduct a market survey on the \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio,\" which is part of the government's \"Future Fund.\"\n\n# Organizational Functions\n\n# November 13\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a public education web series called \"STEPS\" on its social media platforms to introduce its various areas of work. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are differences in style, accuracy, and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is clear and grammatically correct, but it omits the acronym \"HKMA,\" which is commonly used in English texts referring to the authority. Translation 2 improves on this by including the acronym in parentheses, which is good practice for clarity. However, \"areas of work\" is slightly less natural than \"aspects of work\" or \"various areas.\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"has launched,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than the original, which uses \"推出\" (launched), suggesting a completed action. It also uses \"work areas of the HKMA,\" which is awkward phrasing. Translation 4 is concise and natural, using \"work across various areas,\" which is a more idiomatic expression. Translation 5 is accurate and includes the acronym, but \"departments\" may not fully capture the breadth of the HKMA's work, which may include functions beyond just departments. Translation 6 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is a different entity, not the HKMA. This is a critical error in translation accuracy.\nBased on this review, the best translation should include the acronym \"HKMA\" in parentheses, use natural phrasing such as \"work across various areas,\" and avoid any misrepresentation of the organization. It should also maintain a clear and concise structure that reflects the original sentence's intent.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a public education web series titled \"STEPS\" on its social media platforms to introduce its work across various areas.\n\n# December 31st\n\nIn 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority made an additional 11 sets of financial data published on its website freely available to the public through open application programming interfaces.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year in 2020, recording its worst-ever decline in history. Consumer and tourism-related industries were particularly hard-hit, with their contraction exceeding that of the overall economy. Meanwhile, the labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. In response to the severe economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced the largest-scale relief measures in history to support the economy. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to restore normal economic activity, with growth anticipated in 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp decline in economic activity was primarily driven by a severe contraction in local demand (Figure 1). The outbreak of the pandemic and the corresponding social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption. Additionally, the deteriorating business environment led to a noticeable reduction in overall investment expenditure. Externally, although the pandemic caused supply chain disruptions and a contraction in global demand, Hong Kong's goods exports only slightly declined for the year, partly benefiting from the rapid recovery of production and economic activity in mainland China. In contrast, Hong Kong's service exports were severely affected as global tourism came to a standstill due to lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions. Weak demand driven by local and re-export activities also led to a deterioration in goods imports and service inputs. As the decline in imports outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to Hong Kong's gross domestic product (Figure 1). By economic sector, consumption and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food services, were hit particularly hard, experiencing contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector recorded moderate growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to the Previous Period)\nThe original Chinese text is a table title that specifies the type of economic growth (real GDP), the classification method (by expenditure item), and the comparison basis (compared to the previous period). The junior translators have produced several variations of this title, with differences in terminology and phrasing.\nThe first junior translator used \"Local GDP\" instead of \"Gross Domestic Product,\" which is less standard in international economic terminology. \"Local GDP\" may be confusing or inaccurate in this context.\nThe second junior translator used \"Year-on-Year,\" which is a common term in financial reporting, but it is not the exact equivalent of \"比對上期\" (compared to the previous period). \"Year-on-Year\" typically implies a comparison with the same period in the previous year, whereas \"compared to the previous period\" could refer to a shorter time frame, such as a quarter or month.\nThe third junior translator used \"Expenditure Category\" instead of \"Expenditure Item,\" which is a more precise and commonly used term in economic contexts. However, the use of \"Year-on-Year\" again introduces a potential misinterpretation of the time frame.\nThe fourth junior translator used \"Expenditure Items\" and \"Compared to Previous Period,\" which is accurate and clear, but \"Local GDP\" is still not the standard term.\nThe fifth junior translator used \"Comparison with Previous Period,\" which is slightly more formal than \"Compared to the Previous Period,\" but both are acceptable.\nThe sixth junior translator used \"Expenditure Category\" and \"Compared to the Previous Period,\" which is accurate and aligns well with standard economic terminology.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use the standard term \"Gross Domestic Product\" instead of \"Local GDP,\" use \"Expenditure Category\" for clarity and precision, and use \"Compared to the Previous Period\" to accurately reflect the comparison basis. The final translation should be concise, clear, and consistent with international economic terminology.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth\nThe original Chinese text, \"圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻,\" is a title that indicates the content of Figure 1, which is about the contribution of various components to the growth of real local GDP.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. The first translation, \"Contribution of Components in Figure 1 to the Growth of Real Local GDP,\" is grammatically correct but lacks the clarity of a title. It reads more like a sentence than a title.\nThe second translation, \"Figure 1 shows the contribution of various components to real local gross domestic product growth,\" is a full sentence and not suitable as a title. It also uses \"gross domestic product\" instead of the more commonly used abbreviation \"GDP.\"\nThe third translation, \"Figure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth,\" is concise and clear, but it omits the term \"local,\" which is present in the original Chinese text.\nThe fourth translation, \"Figure 1: Contribution to Real GDP Growth by Component,\" is also concise but changes the structure of the original phrase, which may affect the clarity of the meaning.\nThe fifth translation, \"Figure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth,\" is similar to the third one and is also missing the term \"local.\"\nThe sixth translation, \"Figure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth,\" is the most accurate in terms of content, as it includes all the key terms from the original text. However, it uses \"local\" which may not be the most appropriate term in this context, as \"real GDP\" typically refers to GDP adjusted for inflation, not necessarily GDP of a specific local area.\nConsidering the above, the best possible translation would be \"Figure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth,\" as it is concise, clear, and uses the standard term \"GDP\" rather than the full form. It also maintains the structure of the original phrase, making it suitable as a title.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the government's response through the 2020-21 Budget, the \"Anti-Epidemic Fund,\" the four rounds of subsidies, the 10,000 HKD cash handout, the \"Job Retention\" or similar programs, and the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in supporting the banking sector.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"relief measures,\" \"one-time cash payment,\" \"wage subsidies,\" and \"three-pronged approach.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical errors:** Several translations incorrectly state the total amount as \"300 billion\" instead of \"3,000 billion\" (HK$3,000 billion). This is a critical error that misrepresents the scale of the financial measures.\n- **Terminology inconsistencies:** Some translations use \"Fighting the Epidemic Fund,\" \"Pandemic Preparedness and Response Fund,\" or \"Anti-Epidemic Fund.\" The original text uses \"防疫抗疫基金,\" which is best translated as \"Pandemic Prevention and Control Fund\" or \"Anti-Epidemic Fund.\" Consistency in terminology is important for clarity.\n- **Fluency and redundancy:** Some translations are slightly redundant or awkward in phrasing, such as \"releasing buffers to enhance banks' lending capacity\" or \"financial liquidity pressures.\"\n- **Cultural and contextual accuracy:** The term \"real economy\" is used, which is appropriate, but the phrase \"sustain the real economy\" or \"underpin the real economy\" is more idiomatic in English.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Correct the numerical error to reflect \"HK$3,000 billion.\"\n- Use a consistent and accurate name for the fund, such as \"Anti-Epidemic Fund.\"\n- Improve fluency by using more natural phrasing, such as \"alleviate financial pressures\" instead of \"alleviate financial liquidity pressures.\"\n- Ensure that the translation reflects the formal tone of the original while maintaining clarity and readability in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo address the pandemic, the government swiftly introduced the largest relief measures in history through the 2020-21 Fiscal Budget, disbursing four rounds of subsidies totaling over HK$3,000 billion from the Anti-Epidemic Fund. These measures included a one-time cash payment of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the \"Job Retention\" program, and one-time grants, rent reductions, and fee waivers for industries severely affected by the pandemic. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopted a three-pronged approach to support the banking sector, thereby underpinning the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with the banking industry to alleviate financial pressures on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks' lending capacity, and ensuring that banks had sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures eased noticeably in 2020. Excluding the effect of the government’s one-off relief measures, the core inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis in 2009. Price pressures on basic food items (particularly fresh pork) diminished significantly; and dining-out prices also fell in the second half of the year, thanks to substantial discounts offered by the catering industry, apart from home cooking. Growth in the rental component of the Consumer Price Index also softened, following the decline in newly signed private residential rents (Figure 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures decreased as nominal wage growth slowed and commercial property rents remained subdued; meanwhile, import price inflation eased amid the weak global economic environment.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality and readability of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key data points, such as the unemployment rate increase, the sectors most affected, the underemployment rate, and the government's response.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"seasonally adjusted unemployment rate,\" \"underemployment rate,\" and \"labor force participation rate\" is accurate and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the translation of the government program. Some use \"Job Protection,\" others use \"Employment Retention Scheme,\" and one uses \"Employment Protection Scheme.\" A consistent and commonly used term would be preferable.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use phrases that are slightly awkward or less idiomatic, such as \"offering the labor market a certain degree of support\" or \"triggering a cyclical response.\" These can be refined for smoother readability.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"SARS outbreak\" is used in all translations, which is appropriate, but \"SARS epidemic\" is also acceptable and may be more commonly used in certain contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3)\" and \"reflecting a further contraction in overall labor demand.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use a consistent and widely recognized term for the government program, such as \"Job Protection Program\" or \"Employment Retention Scheme.\"\n- Ensure smoother sentence structure and more idiomatic expressions, avoiding overly literal translations.\n- Eliminate redundancy and ensure that the flow of information is natural and fluent.\n- Maintain consistency in terminology, particularly for terms like \"SARS outbreak\" or \"SARS epidemic.\"\nBased on this review and reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% within the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3), with unemployment rates in heavily impacted sectors such as retail, accommodation, and food services exceeding 10%. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest level since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to a cyclical response to the rapid deterioration of economic conditions, the labor force participation rate slightly declined. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies sharply declined, reflecting further contraction in overall labor demand. Nominal wage and income growth further slowed. The government introduced the \"Job Protection\" program, providing employers with time-limited financial support to retain employees, offering the labor market a certain degree of support.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all quite similar and mostly accurate in conveying the meaning of the original Chinese text, which is \"圖 3 勞工市場狀況.\" The term \"狀況\" can be translated as \"status,\" \"conditions,\" or \"situation,\" all of which are appropriate in this context.\nThe first junior translator used \"Status,\" which is a direct and acceptable translation. However, \"Conditions\" and \"Situation\" are also commonly used in academic or economic contexts to describe the state of a market. \nThe second, third, fourth, and sixth junior translators used \"Conditions,\" which is a natural and commonly used term in English when referring to the state of a labor market. The third and fourth translators also included a colon after \"Figure 3,\" which is a more standard format in academic or technical writing.\nThe fifth junior translator used \"Situation,\" which is also a valid translation, though slightly less common than \"Conditions\" in this specific context.\nConsidering the above, \"Figure 3: Labor Market Conditions\" is the most natural and standard translation in academic or technical contexts. It is concise, clear, and commonly used in reports or studies discussing labor market data.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nWith the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. Following the introduction of large-scale support measures by central banks and governments worldwide, the stock market showed a slight recovery in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). As breakthroughs were made in the development of coronavirus vaccines, the stock market regained some upward momentum toward the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points by year-end, recording a 3.4% annual decline. Benefiting from the secondary listings of mainland Chinese companies in Hong Kong, the total amount raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong in 2020 reached approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nThe original text is a simple label for a figure, likely from an academic or technical document. The junior translators have mostly produced acceptable translations, though there are minor differences in punctuation and pluralization.\nThe first junior translator used \"Figure 4 Asset Prices\" without a colon, which is less common in formal writing but still understandable. The second, fourth, and sixth junior translators used \"Figure 4: Asset Prices,\" which is the most standard and widely accepted format for labeling figures in English texts. The third junior translator used the singular \"Asset Price,\" which is incorrect in this context, as \"prices\" refers to a general concept, not a single price. The fifth junior translator mirrored the first, using \"Figure 4 Asset Prices\" without a colon.\nThe best translation should follow standard formatting conventions, use the correct plural form, and include a colon after the figure number. Therefore, \"Figure 4: Asset Prices\" is the most appropriate and professional choice.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nSupported in part by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained largely stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared to the previous year. However, due to a decline in household incomes, affordability for home purchases became tighter. On the other hand, the non-residential property market further weakened, with property prices declining to varying degrees and transaction volumes hitting a low. Affected by economic contraction and rising vacancy rates, office and retail property rents fell sharply. Given that the non-residential property market had already experienced significant adjustments since 2019 and was expected to continue facing downward pressure, and considering other factors such as the economic outlook and external environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also revoked the double-rate stamp duty on non-residential property purchases, a demand management measure, in November.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality and naturalness of the English translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main points: the expected economic recovery in Hong Kong due to vaccination, the uncertainties affecting the pace of recovery, the role of mainland China's economy, and the government's GDP growth forecast.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key terms such as \"economic recovery,\" \"vaccine supply,\" \"coverage,\" and \"effectiveness\" are accurately translated.\n- The use of terms like \"real GDP growth rate\" and \"large-scale vaccination programs\" is appropriate and aligns with standard economic terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use repetitive or awkward phrasing, such as \"the local economy will continue to face considerable challenges\" or \"the local economy will still face considerable challenges,\" which can be simplified for better flow.\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"year-on-year\" or \"annual total\" when the original text simply says \"全年合計\" (full year total), which is more naturally expressed as \"for the full year of 2021\" or \"for the entire year of 2021.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"merchandise and service exports\" in one translation is less common than \"goods and services exports,\" which is more standard in economic contexts.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"rollout\" while others use \"vaccination,\" which can be inconsistent. \"Vaccination rollout\" is more precise and commonly used in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use more natural and fluent phrasing, avoiding repetition and overly formal expressions.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, such as using \"vaccination rollout\" or \"vaccine rollout\" consistently.\n- Use standard economic terminology, such as \"goods and services exports\" instead of \"merchandise and service exports.\"\n- Ensure clarity and precision in expressions like \"for the full year of 2021\" rather than \"year-on-year\" or \"annual total.\"\n- Maintain a balanced tone that reflects the original's formal yet informative nature.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to restore normal economic activities, with Hong Kong’s economy projected to return to positive growth for the full year of 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, since widespread vaccination will take time, the local economy will continue to face significant challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, the mainland Chinese economy is expected to strengthen further, providing support for Hong Kong’s goods and services exports. However, the recovery pace of other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts that real GDP growth in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, consistent with the average growth forecast of 4.4% for Hong Kong by international organizations and private sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nGiven the original Chinese text, the six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"transmission effect\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. However, \"newly signed\" may be slightly off in the context of \"private residential rents\" — it should be \"recent decline\" rather than \"newly signed.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"lagged effect\" is slightly more technical than \"transmission effect,\" which may be less common in economic reporting. The phrase \"recently signed\" is again used inappropriately.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is a strong translation with accurate terminology and natural phrasing. The use of \"pass-through effect\" is slightly more precise than \"transmission effect\" in economic contexts. The structure is clear and the language is fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. The use of \"transmission effect\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. However, \"recently signed\" is again used inappropriately, and \"high level of approximately 5.9%\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is a very strong translation with accurate terminology and natural phrasing. The use of \"transmission effects\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. The phrase \"throughout the year\" is slightly more natural than \"for the entire year.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. The use of \"lagged effects\" is slightly more technical, and \"underlying inflation\" is a slightly different term than \"core inflation,\" which may be less common in the context. The phrase \"around 5.9%\" is natural.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"recently signed\" is incorrect in the context of \"private residential rents\" — it should be \"recent decline.\"\n- \"Transmission effect\" is more commonly used in economic contexts than \"lagged effect\" or \"pass-through effect.\"\n- \"Core inflation\" is the standard term used in economic reporting, so \"underlying inflation\" should be replaced.\n- \"Around 5.9%\" is more natural than \"approximately 5.9%\" or \"about 5.9%.\"\n- \"Throughout the year\" is slightly more natural than \"for the entire year.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use accurate terminology, natural phrasing, and maintain the clarity and fluency of the original text.\n**Improved Translation**:\nGiven the continued challenges in global and local economic conditions, inflationary pressures are expected to remain mild in 2021. Furthermore, the transmission effect of the recent decline in private residential rents will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.5% for 2021, while the government expects overall and core inflation rates to be 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the challenging economic outlook in the early part of 2021, coupled with private sector analysts' expectations that the unemployment rate will remain at a relatively high level of around 5.9% throughout the year, the labor market is expected to remain under pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text, which is that the Hong Kong banking system remained stable and financially sound in 2020 despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. However, there are notable differences in terms of fluency, vocabulary choice, and cultural appropriateness.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and fluent, using terms like \"sound financial conditions\" and \"balance sheet\" appropriately. However, it uses \"deposit funds\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"deposits\" alone.\nTranslation 2 is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"good financial health\" which is a natural expression. However, it uses \"positions\" for \"capital and liquidity,\" which is slightly less common than \"conditions\" or \"levels.\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"resilient\" and \"healthy level,\" which are both natural and appropriate. However, \"banking sector\" is slightly broader than \"banking system\" in the original, which may not be a major issue but is worth noting.\nTranslation 4 uses \"robust\" and \"stable level,\" both of which are appropriate. However, \"maintaining sound financial conditions\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nTranslation 5 is very close to the original in meaning and structure. However, it uses \"稳健 level\" which is a direct translation of the Chinese term and not idiomatic in English. This should be replaced with \"sound\" or \"stable\" level.\nTranslation 6 is very fluent and natural, using \"resilient,\" \"novel coronavirus pandemic,\" and \"capital and liquidity positions.\" It is the most idiomatic and culturally appropriate of the translations.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the natural flow and idiomatic expressions from the best translations while ensuring consistency in terminology and clarity in meaning.\nThe improved translation should use \"resilient\" or \"robust\" to describe the banking system, \"sound financial conditions,\" and \"capital and liquidity positions\" to reflect the financial terminology accurately. It should also use \"slightly deteriorated\" for \"輕微轉差\" and \"remained at a stable level\" for \"仍處穩健水平.\"\nThe final translation should be concise, natural, and accurately reflect the original meaning and nuance.\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2020, with banks maintaining sound financial conditions. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, banks continued to expand their balance sheets, with an increase in deposits. The banking system maintained ample capital and liquidity, while asset quality slightly deteriorated but remained at a stable level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the key figures and percentages, and the structure of the original text is preserved.\n- The use of terms like \"balance sheet,\" \"loan growth,\" \"trade financing,\" and \"related loans\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The temporal references (e.g., \"in 2020,\" \"compared to 2019\") are well-handled across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"economic downturn\" while others use \"economic slowdown.\" Both are acceptable, but \"economic slowdown\" may be more neutral and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations use phrases like \"for the year\" or \"during the year\" redundantly, which can be simplified.\n- **Punctuation and flow:** The use of semicolons and commas varies slightly, affecting the readability. For example, \"among which\" or \"of which\" can be more smoothly integrated.\n- **Consistency in phrasing:** Some translations use \"related loans in mainland China\" while others use \"loans related to mainland China.\" The former is more natural and concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"economic slowdown\" for consistency and neutrality.\n- Avoid redundancy by simplifying phrases like \"for the year\" or \"during the year.\"\n- Ensure consistent phrasing, such as \"related loans in mainland China\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use semicolons and commas effectively to maintain a smooth flow and readability.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic slowdown, loan growth slowed to 1.2%, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019; loans used in Hong Kong rose by 2.2%, while loans used outside Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.1%, and trade financing decreased by 6.2%. Related loans in mainland China slightly declined by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% increase in 2019.\n\nOn the liability side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. As the growth in total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\nThe original Chinese text is a simple caption for a figure, likely from a financial or economic report. The junior translators have mostly produced accurate translations, with only minor variations in punctuation and word order.\nThe first junior translator used a colon after \"Figure 5\" and correctly translated the title as \"Loans and Deposits in the Banking System.\" This is a standard and clear format for figure captions.\nThe second and third junior translators also used the colon format and provided the same accurate translation. Their translations are fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate for an English-language financial document.\nThe fourth junior translator used \"Bank System\" instead of \"Banking System.\" While both are understandable, \"Banking System\" is the more standard and commonly used term in financial contexts, referring to the entire network of banks and financial institutions. \"Bank System\" is less common and may be interpreted as referring to a specific bank's internal system rather than the broader financial system.\nThe fifth and sixth junior translators repeated the same accurate translation as the second and third, using the colon format and the correct terminology.\nOverall, the most accurate and standard translation is \"Figure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System.\" This format is widely used in academic and professional writing to label figures, and the terminology is precise and appropriate for the context. The use of a colon after \"Figure 5\" is standard in English for such captions, and the phrase \"Banking System\" is the correct term in this context.\n\n# Capital Adequacy Ratio\n\nThe original text discusses the capital adequacy of the banking system in 2020, emphasizing its stability and resilience. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the main message: the banking system's capital position remained strong in 2020, with stable capital ratios compared to 2019.\n- The use of terms like \"robust,\" \"sound,\" and \"stable\" effectively captures the intended meaning of the original Chinese.\n- The mention of \"Tier 1 capital ratio\" and the reference to \"Figure 6\" are consistently handled across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use \"comprehensive capital ratio\" or \"combined capital adequacy ratio,\" which may not be the most standard or precise terms in financial English. The term \"aggregate capital ratio\" or \"capital adequacy ratio\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **Fluency and Structure:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"remained stable compared to the end of 2019 at 20.7%\" or \"increased slightly to 18.7% from 18.5% during the same period.\" These can be rephrased for smoother readability.\n- **Consistency:** There is inconsistency in the use of \"authorized institutions\" versus \"licensed institutions\" and in the use of \"consolidated\" versus \"aggregate\" or \"comprehensive.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the standard term \"capital adequacy ratio\" for clarity and consistency with financial terminology.\n- Ensure that the structure of the sentences is parallel and flows naturally, avoiding redundancy.\n- Maintain consistency in the use of terms like \"authorized institutions\" and avoid mixing them with \"licensed institutions\" unless the original text does so.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use precise financial terminology, maintain a clear and fluent structure, and ensure consistency in phrasing and terminology.\nThe banking system's capital position remained robust in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. The capital adequacy ratio of locally registered authorized institutions remained stable at 20.7% at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Figure 6).\n\nAt the end of 2020, the leverage ratio under Basel III remained stable compared to the end of 2019, still at 8.2%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6: Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered Recognized Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Accredited Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations effectively convey the core message of the original text, which is that the banking system's liquidity is strong and well above the statutory minimum requirements for both Tier\/Category 1 and Tier\/Category 2 institutions.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of financial terminology such as \"liquidity coverage ratio\" and \"liquidity maintenance ratio.\"\n- Proper use of numerical data and reference to \"Figure 8.\"\n- Consistent use of formal and professional tone appropriate for financial reporting.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Inconsistency in the terminology used to describe the different types of institutions (e.g., \"Tier 1,\" \"Class 1,\" \"Type 1,\" \"Category 1\"). The original text uses \"第1類機構\" and \"第2類機構,\" which are best translated as \"Category 1 institutions\" and \"Category 2 institutions\" to maintain consistency.\n- Some translations use \"robust\" while others use \"stable\" to describe the liquidity position. \"Robust\" is more appropriate in this context, as it conveys strength and resilience.\n- The phrase \"under pressure\" or \"during periods of stress\" is used in different variations. \"Under stress\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- One translation mistakenly repeats \"liquidity coverage ratio\" for both Category 1 and Category 2 institutions, which is an error.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should:\n- Use \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" consistently.\n- Use \"robust\" to describe the liquidity position.\n- Use \"under stress\" to describe the conditions under which the banking system can withstand liquidity shocks.\n- Ensure that the correct ratios are attributed to the correct categories.\nThe improved translation would be:\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust and capable of withstanding liquidity shocks under stress. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 155.1% in the fourth quarter, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 57.9%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\n\nThe original text discusses the stability of the banking system's funding sources and provides specific figures for two categories of institutions. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect clarity and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the key information: the stability of funding sources, the specific percentages, and the comparison to statutory minimums.\n- The use of terms like \"net stable funding ratio\" and \"core capital ratio\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The reference to \"Figure 9\" is correctly included in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"remained stable\" while others use \"remain stable\" or \"have remained stable.\" The choice of tense affects the nuance. \"Remained stable\" implies a completed state, while \"have remained stable\" suggests a continuous state up to the present, which may be more accurate in this context.\n- The third junior translator uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2A\" instead of \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2A.\" This could be misleading, as \"Tier\" is typically used in the context of capital adequacy (e.g., Tier 1 capital), not for categorizing institutions.\n- Some translations use \"core funding ratio\" instead of \"core capital ratio.\" While \"core funding\" might be understood, \"core capital ratio\" is the more precise and standard term in banking terminology.\n- The use of \"far exceeding,\" \"significantly higher than,\" and \"well above\" are all acceptable, but \"significantly above\" is slightly more neutral and commonly used in formal reports.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"have remained stable\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the stability.\n- Use \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2A\" to avoid confusion with \"Tier.\"\n- Use \"core capital ratio\" for consistency with standard financial terminology.\n- Use \"significantly above\" for a balanced and formal tone.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate these considerations for clarity, precision, and consistency with financial terminology.\nThe banking system's funding sources have remained stable. As of the end of 2020, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, significantly above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The core capital ratio for Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, also significantly above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率,\" which translates literally to \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions.\" The task is to produce a natural, accurate, and culturally appropriate English translation.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This translation is accurate and closely follows the original wording. It uses \"Designated Recognized Institutions,\" which is a direct and precise rendering of \"指定認可機構.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"Funding Ratio\" may not be the most standard term in financial contexts. \"Capital Adequacy Ratio\" is more commonly used in banking and regulatory contexts.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:** \"Figure 9 shows the capital adequacy ratio of approved institutions.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"capital adequacy ratio,\" which is a standard term in financial regulation.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"shows the\" is unnecessary in a figure caption and makes it less concise. Also, \"approved institutions\" is less precise than \"designated recognized institutions.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Recognized Authorities\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Authorities\" is a misinterpretation of \"機構\" (institutions), which is more accurately translated as \"institutions.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratios of Designated Accredited Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Funding Ratios\" (plural), which may be appropriate if the figure includes multiple ratios.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Accredited\" is not the best match for \"認可\" in this context. \"Recognized\" is more standard in regulatory contexts.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is identical to the first translation and is accurate and concise.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation—use of \"Funding Ratio\" may not be the most standard term.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 9: Capital Ratio of Designated Recognized Bodies\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Capital Ratio,\" which is closer to standard financial terminology.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Bodies\" is not the best translation of \"機構\" in this context. \"Institutions\" is more appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, fluency, and standard terminology. \"Capital Adequacy Ratio\" is the most standard term in financial regulation, but it may be too specific if the original text is more general. \"Funding Ratio\" is a direct translation but may not be as standard. \"Designated Recognized Institutions\" is the most accurate rendering of \"指定認可機構.\"\nTherefore, the best translation would be:  \n**Figure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions**  \nThis version is accurate, concise, and maintains the original structure while using appropriate terminology.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nUnder the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the asset quality of the banking system slightly declined during the year, but remained good by historical and international standards. The specific classification loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). The specific classification loan ratio for loans related to mainland China increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. The delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low, at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking System\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text, \"圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素.\" All translations correctly identify \"圖 10\" as \"Figure 10\" and \"銀行體系的資產質素\" as \"Asset Quality of the Banking System\" or \"Quality of the Banking System's Assets.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting and phrasing that can be refined for clarity and consistency.\nThe first and second translations use \"Figure 10 Asset Quality of the Banking System,\" which is grammatically correct but lacks a colon or punctuation to separate the figure label from the title, which is less common in formal or academic contexts. The third translation, \"Quality of the Banking System's Assets,\" is slightly more natural in English phrasing but may be less commonly used in financial or regulatory contexts, where \"Asset Quality of the Banking System\" is more standard.\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth translations all use \"Figure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking System,\" which is the most standard and widely accepted format for labeling figures in formal documents. The use of a colon clearly separates the figure number from the title, enhancing readability and professionalism.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would follow the format used by the fourth, fifth, and sixth junior translators, with the addition of a colon to separate the figure number from the title, as this is the most conventional and clear presentation in English technical or academic writing. The phrase \"Asset Quality of the Banking System\" is also the most standard and widely used in financial contexts, making it the most appropriate choice for conveying the intended meaning accurately and professionally.\n\nFigure 11: Delinquency Rates for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\n\n# Profit Trends\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 盈利走勢,\" which translates to \"Profit Trends\" or \"Profit Trend\" depending on the context. The term \"走勢\" can mean \"trend,\" \"movement,\" or \"direction,\" and in financial contexts, it is commonly translated as \"trend.\" The use of the hashtag \"#\" suggests that this is likely a title or heading, possibly for a report, chart, or section in a document.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are some nuances to consider. \"Profit Trends\" (used by the first, fifth, and sixth translators) implies a broader, ongoing pattern or series of trends, which may be appropriate if the context involves multiple trends or a general overview. On the other hand, \"Profit Trend\" (used by the second, third, and fourth translators) is more singular and may be better suited for a specific trend or a single chart or section.\nGiven that the original text includes a hashtag, it is likely intended as a heading or title. In such cases, it is common to use a singular noun unless the context clearly indicates multiple trends. However, in financial or business contexts, \"Profit Trends\" is often used to refer to the general direction of profitability over time, which may be more appropriate for a broader context.\nTherefore, \"Profit Trends\" is the most natural and commonly used translation for this phrase in English, especially when used as a heading or title. It conveys the intended meaning clearly and is in line with standard financial terminology.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing, terminology, and fluency that can be refined for greater precision and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main points: the low-interest rate environment, the slight decline in asset quality, the pressure on profitability, the 29.4% drop in pre-tax operating profit, the reasons for the decline (net interest income and loan impairment provisions), and the narrowing of the net interest margin.\n- The use of terms like \"net interest income,\" \"loan impairment provisions,\" and \"net interest margin\" is consistent and appropriate in a financial context.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Banking system\" vs. \"banking sector\":** The original Chinese uses \"銀行體系\" (banking system), which is more specific and refers to the entire banking infrastructure. However, in financial English, \"banking sector\" is more commonly used to refer to the industry as a whole. This is a minor point but worth noting for consistency.\n- **\"Profitability\" vs. \"profits\":** While both are correct, \"profitability\" is more abstract and refers to the ability to generate profit, whereas \"profits\" is more concrete. The original text uses \"盈利受壓\" (profitability is under pressure), so \"profitability\" is more accurate.\n- **\"Loan loss provisions\" vs. \"loan impairment provisions\":** Both are acceptable, but \"loan impairment provisions\" is more standard in financial reporting and aligns with international accounting standards.\n- **\"Coupled with\" vs. \"combined with\":** \"Coupled with\" is slightly more formal and precise, but \"combined with\" is also correct and commonly used.\n- **\"Narrowed from... to...\" vs. \"narrowed from... to...\":** All translations use this structure correctly, but the verb \"narrowed\" is appropriate and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"banking sector\" consistently for \"銀行體系\" to align with common financial terminology.\n- Use \"profitability\" instead of \"profits\" to match the nuance of the original.\n- Use \"loan impairment provisions\" for consistency with financial reporting standards.\n- Use \"coupled with\" for a slightly more formal tone.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and flows naturally in English.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe low-interest environment, coupled with a slight decline in asset quality, has put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector. The overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks decreased by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), primarily due to a decrease in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment provisions (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nDue to income decline, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banking increased from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12: Performance of Retail Banking\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖 12 零售銀行的表現,\" which translates to \"Figure 12: Performance of Retail Banking.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of this translation, with minor differences in punctuation and phrasing.\nThe first junior translator used \"Performance of Retail Banks,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"Retail Banking,\" as the latter refers to the industry or sector, while \"Retail Banks\" refers to individual institutions.\nThe second junior translator used \"The Performance of Retail Banking,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary, as the article \"The\" is not typically used in figure captions unless it is part of a proper noun or title.\nThe third junior translator used the same translation as the first, which is correct but slightly less precise than \"Retail Banking.\"\nThe fourth junior translator omitted the colon after \"Figure 12,\" which is not standard in figure captions and can lead to confusion.\nThe fifth and sixth junior translators used \"Performance of Retail Banking,\" which is the most accurate and concise translation of the original Chinese text.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be \"Figure 12: Performance of Retail Banking,\" as it accurately reflects the original Chinese text, uses standard punctuation, and is concise and clear.\n\nFigure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖 13 零售銀行淨息差,\" which translates to \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with slight differences in terminology and phrasing.\nTranslation 1: \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Bank\" uses \"Retail Bank\" as a singular noun, which may be less appropriate in this context, as the term \"retail banking\" is more commonly used to refer to the sector as a whole.\nTranslation 2: \"Figure 13 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\" omits the colon after \"Figure 13,\" which is a minor but noticeable deviation from standard formatting in academic or financial contexts.\nTranslation 3: \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\" uses the plural \"Banks,\" which may imply multiple banks rather than the sector as a whole, which could be misleading.\nTranslation 4: \"Figure 13: Retail Banking Net Interest Spread\" uses \"Net Interest Spread\" instead of \"Net Interest Margin,\" which is a different financial term. \"Net Interest Margin\" is the more commonly used term in banking contexts.\nTranslation 5: \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\" is accurate and uses the correct terminology, with proper formatting.\nTranslation 6: \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\" is similar to Translation 3, using the plural \"Banks\" which may not be the best choice in this context.\nBased on this review, the best translation would be \"Figure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking,\" as it accurately reflects the original Chinese text, uses the correct financial terminology, and follows standard formatting conventions.\n\nFigure 14: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\nAll six translations are very similar and only differ in minor stylistic choices, such as the use of a colon or a space after \"Figure 14\" and the word order in \"Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\" versus \"Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banking.\" \nThe most common and standard format in English is \"Figure 14: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio,\" which is used in five of the six translations. This format is clear, concise, and follows standard English conventions for labeling figures. The sixth translation, \"Figure 14: Cost-to-Income Ratio of Retail Banking,\" is also grammatically correct but slightly less direct and more wordy than the others.\nThe best translation would follow the most common and standard format, which is \"Figure 14: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio.\" This version is concise, clear, and aligns with standard English usage in academic and professional contexts.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","en":"# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the uncertainties introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets have operated smoothly and orderly. Supported by substantial inflows of capital related to equities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained relatively strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee being triggered multiple times. The linked exchange rate system serves as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, fully demonstrating its strong resilience against shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe original text outlines Hong Kong's monetary policy objective and the mechanism behind its currency stability—specifically, the currency board system and the 100% reserve requirement. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Translation 1** uses \"currency issuance regime\" and \"money supply,\" which are not the most precise terms. \"Money supply\" is broader than \"monetary base,\" and \"currency issuance regime\" is not the standard term used in economic literature.\n**Translation 2** is the most accurate in terms of terminology, using \"currency board system\" and \"monetary base,\" which are standard in economic contexts. It also uses \"100 percent backing\" and \"aligning with the percentage change,\" which are precise and natural.\n**Translation 3** uses \"currency issuance bureau mechanism,\" which is not a standard term. It also repeats \"monetary base\" and \"100% alignment,\" which is slightly redundant.\n**Translation 4** is very close to Translation 2, using \"currency board system\" and \"monetary base.\" It also uses \"fully matching the changes in the monetary base,\" which is natural and precise.\n**Translation 5** uses \"currency board arrangement,\" which is acceptable, and \"matching the change in the monetary base by 100%,\" which is slightly awkward but still understandable.\n**Translation 6** uses \"Exchange Fund system,\" which is incorrect. The correct term is \"currency board system.\" It also uses \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100%,\" which is similar to Translation 5.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the standard term \"currency board system,\" refer to the \"monetary base\" rather than \"money supply,\" and use precise phrasing such as \"100% backing\" and \"fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\" It should also avoid redundancy and ensure fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must correspondingly increase or decrease, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe original text outlines the components of the \"monetary base\" as defined in Table 1. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. The term \"Certificates of indebtedness\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. However, \"total balances\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified to \"total balance.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"Promissory Notes\" instead of \"Certificates of indebtedness,\" which may be a misinterpretation of the original term. \"Total Reserves\" is a more precise term than \"total balance\" for the settlement accounts, but it may not be the exact term used in the original context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Incorrectly translates \"Certificates of indebtedness\" as \"Certificates of Deposit,\" which is a significant error. Also, references the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is inaccurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in terms of terminology and structure. It uses \"Certificates of indebtedness\" correctly and \"total reserve\" as a more precise term for the settlement accounts. However, \"the total reserve\" could be better phrased as \"the total reserve balance\" for clarity.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"comprises\" instead of \"includes,\" which is a more formal and precise term. The term \"currency in circulation\" is slightly more natural than \"circulating paper currency and coins.\" The use of \"aggregate balances of clearing accounts\" is accurate, though \"clearing accounts\" may be more commonly referred to as \"settlement accounts\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent, but \"Liability certificates\" is a less common term than \"Certificates of indebtedness.\" Also, \"total balance\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"Certificates of indebtedness\" is the most accurate translation of \"負債證明書.\"\n- \"HKMA\" is the correct and commonly used abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- \"Total reserve balance\" is a more precise and natural term than \"total balance\" or \"total reserves.\"\n- \"Circulating banknotes and coins\" is a standard and clear phrasing.\n- \"Settlement accounts\" is the correct term for \"結算戶口.\"\n- \"Comprises\" is a more formal and precise term than \"includes\" in this context.\n- \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" is the correct term for \"外匯基金票據及債券.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- The total reserve balance in settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\nThe provided translations are all very similar and reflect a standard way of labeling a table in English. The primary difference lies in the use of a colon (\":\") after \"Table 1\" in some translations and its absence in others. In formal or academic writing, it is common to use a colon to introduce the title of the table, as in \"Table 1: Monetary Base.\" This format is widely accepted and enhances readability by clearly separating the table number from its title.\nHowever, the use of a colon is not strictly mandatory, and both \"Table 1 Monetary Base\" and \"Table 1: Monetary Base\" are grammatically correct and commonly used. The choice between them often depends on stylistic preferences or the specific formatting guidelines of the publication or institution.\nIn terms of fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness, all translations are accurate and appropriate. The term \"Monetary Base\" is the correct and standard translation of \"貨幣基礎\" in the context of economics or finance. It is a technical term that is well understood in English-speaking academic and professional circles.\nConsidering these factors, the most universally acceptable and stylistically appropriate format would be \"Table 1: Monetary Base,\" as it clearly separates the table number from its title and is consistent with standard formatting conventions in English academic and professional writing.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, which outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. However, they vary in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to financial terminology and conventions.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA's role and the mechanisms involved (automatic interest rate adjustment and exchange rate guarantees).\n- They all accurately describe the process of buying\/selling HKD and USD at the specified rates (7.75 and 7.85) when the exchange guarantees are triggered.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use inconsistent or less precise terms, such as \"exchange guarantee\" versus \"convertibility undertaking\" or \"exchange rate guarantee.\" The term \"convertibility undertaking\" is more precise in the context of the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward or repetitive, such as using \"thereby increasing (or decreasing)\" or \"causing the interest rate to fall (or rise)\" which can be streamlined.\n- **Cultural and Financial Appropriateness:** The term \"total surplus\" or \"total reserves\" is used in some translations, but \"aggregate balance\" or \"total reserves\" may be more appropriate in the context of central banking.\n- **Clarity of the Exchange Rate Band:** Some translations use \"exchange rate range\" or \"exchange band,\" which are acceptable, but \"exchange rate band\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use of precise financial terminology such as \"convertibility undertaking\" and \"exchange rate band.\"\n- Streamline sentence structure to enhance fluency and readability.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and avoid redundancy.\n- Use of \"total reserves\" or \"aggregate balance\" depending on the intended nuance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the convertibility undertaking. When the strong (or weak) side of the convertibility undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the total reserves, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the 7.75 to 7.85 exchange rate band.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\nThe original Chinese text is a short heading or title: \"# 匯率穩定\". The translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar, with only minor differences in capitalization and punctuation.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate lexical choice (\"exchange rate stability\" is the correct translation of \"匯率穩定\"). However, the translations lack nuance and context. The original text includes a hashtag (#), which is commonly used in digital or social media contexts to denote a topic or theme. None of the translations preserve this element, which may be important depending on the intended use of the text.\nAdditionally, the original text is a heading, and in English, headings are typically capitalized and may be italicized or bolded depending on formatting. The translations provided are all in title case, which is appropriate for headings, but they do not include the hashtag, which may be significant in certain contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be to preserve the hashtag and format the heading appropriately. Therefore, the improved translation would be:\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nWith the outbreak of the novel coronavirus globally in March, risk-averse sentiment led global investors to increase their holdings of U.S. dollars, significantly tightening U.S. dollar liquidity. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by corresponding U.S. dollar rates, so the tightness of U.S. dollar liquidity caused Hong Kong's monetary conditions to tighten. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve later implemented liquidity measures, easing dollar funding pressures, Hong Kong's monetary conditions remained relatively tight due to stock-related demand and end-of-quarter effects. The strong demand for Hong Kong dollars, combined with the positive interest rate differential between Hong Kong dollars and U.S. dollars, stimulated carry trade activities, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate toward the strong-side exchange rate guarantee (Figure 1). The strong-side exchange rate guarantee was ultimately triggered in April. Subsequently, robust initial public offering (IPO) fundraising activities, along with southbound capital inflows under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, drove sustained inflows of stock-related capital, keeping the Hong Kong dollar near the 7.75 level and causing the strong-side exchange rate guarantee to be triggered multiple times throughout 2020. The strong-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, resulting in an accumulated inflow of HK$383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rates\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖 1 2020年市場匯率,\" which translates to \"Figure 1 2020 Market Exchange Rate.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, with the main differences being the use of singular or plural forms of \"exchange rate\" and the placement of the year.\nThe first junior translator used \"Market Exchange Rate\" in the singular, which is grammatically correct but may not be the most natural choice in this context, as \"exchange rates\" is more commonly used when referring to a range of rates or a general concept.\nThe second junior translator used \"Market Exchange Rates in 2020,\" which is grammatically correct and natural, but the preposition \"in\" is not typically used in figure captions in this context. It is more common to see the year placed directly after the figure label without a preposition.\nThe third and fourth junior translators used \"2020 Market Exchange Rates,\" which is the most natural and commonly used format for figure captions. It is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns with standard conventions in academic and professional writing.\nThe fifth junior translator used \"Figure 1 2020 Market Exchange Rate,\" which is missing a colon after \"Figure 1,\" making it less formal and less standard for figure captions.\nThe sixth junior translator used \"Figure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rate,\" which is grammatically correct but uses the singular form of \"exchange rate,\" which may not be the most appropriate choice in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"Figure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rates,\" as it uses the plural form, which is more natural in this context, and follows standard conventions for figure captions.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the original meaning. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"total reserves\" and \"aggregate amount\" consistently, and includes \"Figure 2\" correctly.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Contains several numerical errors (e.g., 3,835 billion instead of 383.5 billion, 200 billion instead of 20 billion). Also, the phrase \"bills issued by the Exchange Fund\" is not standard terminology.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"aggregate reserves\" and \"total outstanding amount\" and includes \"Figure 2.\"\n   - **Weaknesses**: Contains numerical errors (e.g., 457.5 billion instead of 4,575 billion). Also, the phrase \"interest absorption\" is awkwardly phrased.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"aggregate balance\" and \"foreign exchange fund notes and bonds\" consistently. Correctly references \"linked exchange rate assurance scheme.\"\n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly states that the HKMA \"gradually issued\" instead of \"reduced the issuance\" of bills. Also, the phrase \"which offset the practice of using newly issued...\" is awkward.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"aggregate balance\" and \"Exchange Fund bills\" consistently. Correctly references \"strong-side conversion undertaking.\"\n   - **Weaknesses**: Contains numerical errors (e.g., 1,133 billion instead of 11,330 billion). Also, the phrase \"interest paid on outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds by consistently absorbing them\" is awkward.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"total reserves\" and \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" consistently.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Contains numerical errors (e.g., 113.3 billion instead of 11,330 billion). Also, the phrase \"which offset the usual practice of issuing new...\" is awkward.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"total stock of Hong Kong dollar liquidity\" and \"Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\" consistently. Correctly references \"strong-side exchange rate guarantee.\"\n   - **Weaknesses**: Contains numerical errors (e.g., 1,133 billion instead of 11,330 billion). Also, the phrase \"absorbing interest payments on outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds through new issuances\" is awkward.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Correct all numerical values to match the original text.\n- Use standard terminology such as \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" and \"strong-side exchange rate guarantee.\"\n- Ensure consistent use of terms like \"aggregate balance\" or \"total reserves.\"\n- Improve sentence structure for clarity and fluency, avoiding awkward phrasing such as \"interest absorption\" or \"interest paid on outstanding.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe aggregate balance (before discount window operations) and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased from HKD 11,330 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 15,266 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). Following the triggering of the strong-side exchange rate guarantee, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sold a total of HKD 3,835 billion in response to banks' requests. The global macroeconomic volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic prompted the HKMA to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity by gradually reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund bills by a total of HKD 200 billion in late April and early May. As a result of the triggering of the strong-side exchange rate guarantee and the reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund bills, the aggregate balance (before discount window operations) increased from HKD 543 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 4,575 billion at the end of 2020. The total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds slightly decreased from HKD 10,787 billion to HKD 10,692 billion during the year, reflecting the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund bills, which offset the usual practice of using newly issued Exchange Fund bills and bonds to absorb interest payments on outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds. The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2020 Cumulative Surplus (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the Lunar New Year holiday, liquidity demand in Hong Kong declined, leading to a general decrease in Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) in February (Figure 3). In March, HIBOR temporarily rose due to U.S. dollar funding pressures, along with local factors such as liquidity demands from new share offerings and end-of-quarter fund requirements. Subsequently, the triggering of the strong-side convertibility guarantee and a reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund bills led to an increase in aggregate balance, gradually easing the liquidity situation for the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several commonalities and differences emerge. All translations accurately capture the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the impact of U.S. Federal Funds Rate cuts on Hong Kong's basic interest rate, the stability of prime lending rates, the normal functioning of the money market, and the decline in discount window borrowing.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate rendering of key financial terms such as \"Federal Funds Rate,\" \"HIBOR,\" \"basic interest rate,\" \"prime lending rates,\" and \"discount window lending.\" The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall tone is formal and appropriate for a financial context.\nHowever, there are areas for improvement. First, the phrase \"In response to the two rate cuts in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range in March\" is repeated across several translations. While accurate, it lacks variation and could be phrased more precisely. For example, specifying that the rate cuts were \"by the U.S. Federal Reserve\" adds clarity and authority.\nSecond, the use of \"reflecting changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) during the year\" is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing such as \"reflecting year-on-year changes in overnight and one-month HIBOR\" would enhance fluency.\nThird, the term \"discount window borrowing\" is used in some translations, while others use \"discount window lending.\" Both are acceptable, but \"lending\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and may be preferable for consistency.\nFourth, the phrase \"continued to operate normally\" is used in several translations. While correct, \"continued to function normally\" is slightly more idiomatic in formal writing.\nFinally, the numerical values are consistently translated as \"HKD 38.3 billion\" and \"HKD 9.1 billion,\" which is accurate and clear.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the goal is to maintain accuracy while enhancing fluency and variety in expression. The translation should reflect the precise actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, use consistent and idiomatic financial terminology, and ensure smooth, professional prose.\nHere is the improved translation:\nIn response to the two consecutive rate cuts in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range by the Federal Reserve in March, and reflecting year-on-year changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR), the basic interest rate fell from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% by year-end. At the retail level, despite the reduction in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range, banks maintained their prime lending rates unchanged. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending decreased from HKD 38.3 billion in 2019 to HKD 9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2020\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor over three decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating robust resilience in the face of various challenges. Despite the difficulties encountered in 2020, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the system’s stability and effectiveness. Throughout the year, in response to unfounded rumors questioning the Linked Exchange Rate System and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly reaffirmed to the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the Linked Exchange Rate System, emphasizing that the free flow of capital and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The Authority also published several articles clarifying the fact that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to demonstrate strong resilience against shocks even in adverse conditions. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets and the continued normal use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value reflect the effectiveness of these measures in maintaining public confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed in its \"2020 External Sector Report\" that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, all of which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA robust banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's banking system has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and has maintained regulatory oversight of bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA has provided additional liquidity to the banking system to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA has established a series of liquidity arrangements for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA maintains communication with banks to ensure that they utilize these liquidity arrangements during periods of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in global financial markets, the HKMA introduced a temporary U.S. dollar liquidity arrangement to provide U.S. dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate liquidity strains in the global U.S. dollar interbank market.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 109.9% as of December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide strong backing for the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio in 2020\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio in 2020\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nThe term \"support ratio\" is consistently used, which is appropriate. However, \"support rate\" in the third translation is less precise, as \"ratio\" is more commonly used in statistical or analytical contexts. \"Variation,\" \"changes,\" and \"fluctuations\" are all acceptable synonyms for \"變動,\" but \"fluctuations\" is the most natural and commonly used term in English for describing daily changes in a ratio or rate.\nThe use of \"the\" before \"support ratio\" in translations 2, 5, and 6 adds a level of specificity that is appropriate in this context. The placement of \"in 2020\" at the end of the phrase is also more natural in English than placing it at the beginning.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"fluctuations\" for \"變動,\" include \"the\" before \"support ratio\" for grammatical correctness, and place \"in 2020\" at the end for natural flow. Therefore, the improved translation is:\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio in 2020\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio in 2020\n\n# Other Matters\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 其他事務\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation, all of which are essentially correct in terms of meaning. However, there are subtle differences in formatting and punctuation that can affect the perceived professionalism and consistency of the translation.\nThe first, second, fifth, and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original formatting. This is appropriate if the heading is intended to be part of a list or section heading in a document. The third and fourth translations omit the \"#\" symbol, which may be acceptable if the formatting is not crucial, but it could lead to inconsistency with other headings in the document.\nIn terms of capitalization, \"Other Matters\" is more formal and appropriate for a heading, while \"other matters\" is more casual and might be better suited for a body of text rather than a section title. The use of a period at the end of the heading (\"Other matters.\") is also somewhat unconventional in English, as headings typically do not end with a period unless they are complete sentences.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would retain the \"#\" symbol for consistency with the original formatting, use title case (\"Other Matters\") for a more formal and professional appearance, and avoid the period at the end of the heading. This approach ensures that the translation is both accurate and stylistically appropriate for the context in which it will be used.\n\nThe original text discusses the responsibilities of the Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the topics it examined in 2020, and the availability of its records and reports on the HKMA website. The junior translators have produced translations with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the \"Currency Issuance Committee\" as \"Monetary Policy Committee,\" which is a misnomer. It also uses \"Monetary Authority's system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Department,\" which is inaccurate. The translation is otherwise fluent and grammatically sound.\n**Translation 2** refers to the \"Currency Board\" instead of the \"Currency Issuance Committee,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"Currency Board system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Department,\" which is not accurate. However, the structure and fluency are good.\n**Translation 3** also incorrectly refers to the \"Currency Board\" and uses \"Currency Board system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Department.\" It is otherwise fluent and grammatically correct.\n**Translation 4** correctly identifies the \"Monetary Policy Committee\" but incorrectly refers to the \"Currency Issuance Department\" instead of the \"Currency Issuance Committee.\" It also uses \"monetary authority system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Department.\" The translation is fluent and grammatically sound.\n**Translation 5** correctly identifies the \"Currency Issuance Committee\" and uses the correct terminology. It is fluent, grammatically sound, and accurately reflects the original text. It is the most accurate translation so far.\n**Translation 6** incorrectly refers to the \"Currency Board Sub-committee\" instead of the \"Currency Issuance Committee.\" It also uses \"Currency Board System of Operation Report\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Department.\" The translation is otherwise fluent and grammatically sound.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name \"Currency Issuance Committee\" and refer to the \"Currency Issuance Department\" when appropriate. It should also ensure that the structure is clear and that the terminology is consistent with official HKMA usage. The translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and accurately reflect the original text.\nThe fifth junior translator's translation is the closest to being accurate, but it can be improved by using the correct terminology and ensuring clarity in the description of the reports and their availability.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nThe Currency Issuance Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2020, the issues examined by the Currency Issuance Committee included a scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, an assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border capital flows, and understanding the Hong Kong interbank market. The minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance Department submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Institute) maintained a certain level of research output in 2020. In 2020, the Institute published a total of 20 research papers, covering a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructure, and the development of financial technology. Some of these papers have already been accepted or are currently under review for publication in professional journals. Due to the implementation of social distancing measures and travel restrictions during the pandemic, the Institute had to postpone its main activities such as seminars, lectures, and visiting research programs. Once public health and travel conditions return to normal, the Institute will resume these activities.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\nThe original text is a simple heading, likely used in a document or section title related to currency. The junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in terminology and formatting that can be considered for improvement.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations use \"Paper Money and Coins,\" which is a standard and widely understood term in English. The second translation omits the hashtag, which may be appropriate depending on the context, but if the original includes it, it should be retained. The fifth translation uses \"Banknotes and Coins,\" which is also correct but slightly more formal and often used in official or financial contexts. The sixth translation uses \"Paper Currency and Coins,\" which is accurate but slightly more verbose than necessary for a heading.\nConsidering the context of a heading, \"Paper Money and Coins\" is concise, clear, and appropriate. It is widely recognized and avoids unnecessary formality. Therefore, it is the most suitable translation for this context.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of circulating banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 559.5 billion, representing an 8.3% increase compared to the previous year (Figures 5, 6, and 7). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government was HKD 12.7 billion, a 0.6% decrease compared to the previous year (Figures 8 and 9). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 circulating banknotes was HKD 4.6 billion, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 79%.\n\nFigure 5: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation by Issuing Bank as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Paper Money and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2020.\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Paper Money and Coins as of the End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong currency\nThe original text, \"# 香港鈔票,\" translates to \"Hong Kong currency\" in English. The junior translators have attempted to translate \"鈔票\" as \"bills,\" \"banknotes,\" or \"Notes,\" which are all related terms but not entirely accurate in this context. \"Bills\" and \"banknotes\" typically refer to paper money, while \"Notes\" is a more informal or abbreviated term. However, \"currency\" is the most comprehensive and accurate term, as it encompasses both banknotes and coins, and is the standard term used in financial and economic contexts.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in the original text suggests that this might be a title or heading, possibly for a social media post or a section heading. In such cases, it is common to retain the hashtag in the translation. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"Hong Kong currency\" with the hashtag retained, as it maintains the original structure and intent.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, \"Hong Kong currency\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in English. It is also culturally appropriate, as it is the standard term used in financial and economic discussions. The other translations, while not incorrect, are less precise and do not fully capture the meaning of the original text.\nConsidering all these factors, \"Hong Kong currency\" is the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text. It is accurate, fluent, and culturally appropriate, and it maintains the original structure and intent of the text.\n\nFollowing the introduction of new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series banknotes are now in circulation. This series features enhanced and more user-friendly anti-counterfeiting measures, and has been widely welcomed by the public, gradually replacing the older series.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical consistency, and precision of vocabulary.\nFirstly, the use of \"lectures\" versus \"seminars\" is somewhat inconsistent. While both terms are acceptable, \"seminars\" is more commonly used in the context of educational sessions, especially when they are informative and interactive. \"Lectures\" may imply a more formal, one-way delivery, which may not fully capture the intent of the event.\nSecondly, the tense usage is inconsistent. Some translations use \"continued to hold\" while others use \"will continue to hold.\" The original text uses \"年內金管局繼續舉辦講座,\" which is in the past tense, indicating that the events have already occurred. Therefore, the translation should reflect completed actions using the past tense.\nThirdly, the phrase \"enhancing the public's understanding\" is grammatically correct but could be more natural in English. A smoother alternative might be \"to enhance the public's understanding\" or \"which enhanced the public's understanding.\"\nFourthly, the term \"security features\" in the sixth translation is slightly less precise than \"anti-counterfeiting features,\" which is the exact term used in the original text. Maintaining the precise terminology is important for clarity and professionalism.\nLastly, the phrase \"within the year\" in the third translation is somewhat awkward. \"Throughout the year\" is more natural and commonly used in such contexts.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"seminars\" consistently, maintain past tense for completed actions, use precise terminology, and ensure grammatical fluency and natural phrasing.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to host seminars throughout the year to introduce the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA held eight seminars (including online sessions), enhancing the public's understanding of Hong Kong banknotes and attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank tellers, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators capture the general meaning of the original text but vary in accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate terminology. However, \"non-governmental organization flag days\" is slightly awkward and could be more clearly phrased as \"NGO flag days\" or \"charity flag days.\" Also, \"the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups\" is not the correct organization; the correct partner is the Hong Kong Social Service League or Hong Kong Council of Social Service.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. However, \"Hong Kong Social Service Workers' Association\" is not the correct name of the organization. The correct name is the Hong Kong Social Service League or Hong Kong Council of Social Service. Also, \"Red Cross donation box\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Community Chest donation box.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. However, \"Hong Kong Society for Community Services\" is not the correct name of the organization. The correct name is the Hong Kong Council of Social Service or Hong Kong Social Service League. Also, \"non-governmental organization's charity flag sale day\" is awkwardly phrased.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-written. It uses \"Community Chest\" correctly and refers to \"NGO flag days,\" which is appropriate. However, \"loose change collection scheme\" is not the exact term used in the original, which is \"硬幣收集計劃\" (coin collection scheme). Also, \"cash collection vehicles\" is slightly off from the original's \"收銀車\" (coin collection vehicles).\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly uses \"Community Chest\" and \"NGO flag days.\" However, \"Hard Currency Collection Scheme\" is a mistranslation of \"硬幣收集計劃\" (coin collection scheme). \"Hard currency\" refers to foreign currency, not coins.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Community Chest\" and \"Hong Kong Federation of Societies\" is not the correct name of the organization. The correct name is the Hong Kong Council of Social Service or Hong Kong Social Service League.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, use appropriate terminology, and maintain fluency and cultural appropriateness. It should correctly identify the organizations involved, use the correct terms for the coin collection vehicles and donation boxes, and avoid awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the best translation would incorporate the strengths of the fourth and sixth translations while correcting the organizational names and terminology.\n---\nThe Coin Collection Scheme was launched in October 2014 and remained popular with the public throughout the year. It is the world’s first systematic mobile coin collection initiative, featuring two mobile coin collection vehicles that rotate through all 18 districts across Hong Kong. Each vehicle is equipped with two high-speed coin counters, allowing citizens to choose between exchanging coins for cash, adding value to Octopus cards or electronic wallet payment tools, or donating the money to the Hong Kong Community Chest donation box inside the vehicle. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) partnered with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the coin collection vehicles during NGOs’ flag days.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking System Stability\" in English. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in form and completeness. The first, third, and fifth translations use \"Banking system stable,\" which is grammatically incorrect as \"stable\" is an adjective and cannot stand alone as a noun phrase in this context. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Banking System Stability,\" which is the correct noun phrase and matches the original Chinese in both meaning and structure. However, the fourth translation includes a hashtag, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context in which the translation is being used. The other translations omit the hashtag, which may be more suitable for formal or general use.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Banking System Stability,\" as it accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text and is grammatically correct in English. It is also the most commonly used translation among the junior translators, indicating that it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nDespite the significant challenges posed by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic to the economy, the banking system in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2020. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding flexibly while continuing to prioritize the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In light of the persistent rise in cyber threats and the increasing adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA enhanced its regulatory oversight of the technology risk management and operational resilience of authorized institutions. The HKMA also collaborated closely with banks and international organizations to facilitate the industry's transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) approach to regulatory oversight, including flexibility for institutions, guidance for banks during the pandemic, the development of the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect pilot, collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission, and efforts to protect digital financial service consumers.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey its role in prudential or conduct supervision.\n- The key initiatives—Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect, guidance for family offices and high-net-worth investors, and consumer protection in digital finance—are all present in each version.\n- The structure of the original text is largely preserved, with logical flow between the different regulatory measures.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** Some translations use inconsistent or inaccurate terms. For example, “integrity regulation” (translation 5) and “ethical supervision” (translation 6) are not standard terms used in regulatory contexts. The correct term is “conduct supervision” or “prudential supervision,” as seen in translations 1, 2, and 4.\n- **\"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" vs. \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Link\":** Translation 5 uses “Link,” which is incorrect. The official term is “Wealth Management Connect.”\n- **\"Securities and Futures Ordinance\" vs. \"Securities and Futures Commission\":** Translation 3 incorrectly refers to the “Securities and Futures Ordinance,” which is a legal document, not the regulatory body. The correct term is the “Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).”\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward or repetitive. For example, translation 1 uses “on the one hand... on the other hand,” which is grammatically correct but less natural than “while also” or “at the same time.” Translation 3 repeats “the Hong Kong Monetary Authority” unnecessarily.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard regulatory terminology and maintain the formal tone expected in official communications.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct and consistent terminology: “conduct supervision” or “prudential supervision,” “Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,” and “Securities and Futures Commission.”\n- Avoid repetition of “the Hong Kong Monetary Authority” by using “the HKMA” after the first mention.\n- Use more natural phrasing, such as “while also ensuring” instead of “on the one hand... on the other hand.”\n- Ensure that all regulatory bodies and programs are referred to by their official names.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent versions, ensuring consistency in terminology, clarity, and natural English expression.\n---\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) provides recognized institutions with flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements and offers guidance to assist banks in maintaining business operations and continuing to serve customers during the pandemic, while also ensuring the protection of investors and consumers. The HKMA, together with relevant authorities, has developed proposed implementation details for the pilot program of the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect and has consulted with the industry. In collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the HKMA has provided guidance on streamlining the sales procedures for family offices and high-net-worth investors with expertise in financial matters. Furthermore, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection in digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations accurately capture the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) proactive measures in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including adapting to the challenges of the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, as well as embracing technology and international trends.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey its actions and objectives.\n- The key terms such as \"risk-based approach,\" \"compliance technology (RegTech),\" and \"public-private information sharing\" are consistently translated, reflecting the technical and regulatory context.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow, maintaining the original's emphasis on both pandemic-related and geopolitical challenges.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, which is correct, but the phrase \"prudently managing the impact\" is slightly less precise than \"prudently addressing the impact.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"novel coronavirus pandemic,\" which is more specific than necessary and slightly verbose.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the Authority\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in the second paragraph, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the abbreviation.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"the financing of terrorism\" instead of \"terrorist financing,\" which is less standard in financial regulatory contexts.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"the growing geopolitical tensions' impact\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward compared to \"the impact of growing geopolitical tensions.\"\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error in identifying the correct institution.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in the first mention, followed by \"the HKMA\" in subsequent references.\n- Use standard terminology such as \"terrorist financing\" rather than \"the financing of terrorism.\"\n- Maintain clarity and fluency by avoiding overly specific or verbose phrasing, such as \"novel coronavirus pandemic.\"\n- Ensure grammatical precision and natural phrasing, such as \"prudently addressing the impact\" rather than \"prudently managing the impact.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity, accuracy, and fluency of the original message while adhering to standard financial regulatory terminology and ensuring consistency in institutional references.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has swiftly taken action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help authorized institutions more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, including increasing the number of authorized institutions participating in public-private information-sharing initiatives and supporting the banking sector's adoption of compliance technology. In line with international trends in technology and data utilization, the HKMA has also launched further plans to strengthen its supervisory capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working closely with the banking sector to optimize regulatory policies and procedures, as well as implement measures to enhance the professional capabilities of personnel. Hong Kong has made commendable progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing relevant regulatory guidelines. The HKMA continues to strive to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism for authorized institutions, including the formulation of new resolution standards and the implementation of rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements, to enhance the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal crucially depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The HKMA is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Financial Secretary strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its insolvency can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the Financial Secretary serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution framework, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the Financial Secretary’s operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the Financial Secretary adopts approaches that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Oversight\n\nIn 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 186 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 30 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the board, and conducted 30 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also conducts regular on-site inspections, complemented by thematic assessments, to examine areas deemed to be of higher risk. Throughout the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 610 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus on credit risk management as one of the key areas of review and assessment. Another key focus was operational and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the frequency of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, specialized review teams conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has maintained its regulatory rigor and implemented flexible arrangements to effectively and flexibly fulfill its regulatory responsibilities, including providing flexibility in the submission of reports and conducting on-site inspections, enhancing data collection to supplement on-site reviews, and utilizing online meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\nThe original sentence is straightforward and concise, stating that Table 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory work in 2020. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\nTranslation 1 uses \"contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2020.\" This is accurate and natural, though \"contains\" is slightly more passive than \"presents\" or \"summarizes.\"\nTranslation 2 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct regulatory body in Hong Kong, and using the wrong name could lead to confusion or misinformation.\nTranslation 3 uses \"presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2020.\" This is very similar to Translation 1, but \"presents\" is a slightly more active and formal verb, which may be more appropriate in an official or academic context.\nTranslation 4 uses \"summarizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2020.\" This is concise and direct, though it may be slightly less formal than \"contains a summary\" or \"presents a summary.\"\nTranslation 5 uses \"contains an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory activities in 2020.\" This is accurate, but \"overview\" and \"summary\" are not interchangeable in all contexts. \"Overview\" may imply a broader or more general description, while \"summary\" is more focused on condensing information.\nTranslation 6 uses \"contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory activities in 2020.\" This is accurate and includes the acronym, which may be helpful for clarity in some contexts.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would use \"presents\" for its active tone and clarity, and \"summary\" for its precise meaning. Including the acronym (HKMA) may also be useful for clarity, especially in formal or technical documents.\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\nThe original Chinese text is \"表 1 監管工作概要,\" which translates to \"Table 1: Overview of Regulatory Work.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this translation, with slight differences in word choice and punctuation.\nThe first junior translator used \"Summary of Regulatory Work,\" which is a valid translation but slightly less common than \"Overview.\" The second and third translators used \"Overview of Regulatory Work,\" which is more natural and commonly used in formal contexts. The fourth junior translator used \"Supervisory Work\" instead of \"Regulatory Work,\" which is a less accurate translation of \"監管工作\" (supervisory work can be a subset of regulatory work, but \"regulatory work\" is more precise in this context). The fifth junior translator omitted the colon, which is less standard in formal titles. The sixth junior translator used \"Summary of Regulatory Work,\" which, as noted earlier, is less common than \"Overview.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be \"Table 1: Overview of Regulatory Work,\" as it is both accurate and natural in formal English usage.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe original text is a heading, likely from a financial or economic report. The translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar, with minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. \nThe first translation, \"Credit growth and asset quality,\" is lowercase and lacks the hashtag, which may be important if the heading is part of a digital or social media context. The second, third, and fourth translations all include the hashtag and proper capitalization, which is appropriate for a heading. The fifth translation mirrors the first, using lowercase without the hashtag. The sixth translation is similar to the second, third, and fourth but omits the hashtag.\nThe most appropriate translation would be one that maintains the structure and formatting of the original, which includes the hashtag and proper capitalization. Therefore, the best translation is \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality\" with the hashtag.\n\nThe original text provides a concise comparison of loan growth rates between 2020 and 2019, and references Table 2 for further details. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and precision that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly convey the percentage increases and the reference to Table 2.\n- The use of \"loans and advances\" is appropriate and consistent with financial terminology.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"total loan amount,\" which is slightly less precise than \"total loan volume\" in financial contexts.\n- The second and third translators use \"loan volume,\" which is more standard in financial reporting.\n- The fourth junior translator uses \"growth rates\" in the second sentence, which is slightly more precise than \"growth\" alone.\n- The fifth and sixth translators use \"lists\" and \"shows\" respectively, both of which are acceptable, but \"details\" (used by the second and third translators) may be more precise in the context of a table that provides specific data.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should aim for clarity, precision, and natural fluency. \"Loan volume\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"loan amount.\" The phrase \"compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019\" is more concise and natural than \"compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2019.\" Additionally, \"details the growth\" is more precise than \"shows the growth\" when referring to a table that provides specific data.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTotal loan volume increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2: Growth in Loans and Advances\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent in meaning, but there are subtle differences in style and punctuation that affect fluency and formality. \nThe primary difference lies in the use of a colon (\":\") after \"Table 2\" and the preposition used with \"Growth.\" The first, second, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Growth of Loans and Advances,\" while the fifth uses \"Growth in Loans and Advances.\" Both prepositions are grammatically correct, but \"Growth in\" is slightly more natural in formal English when referring to the subject matter of a table or report. It implies that the table is about the growth of these financial instruments, rather than being a direct title of the growth itself.\nAdditionally, the use of a colon (\":\") after \"Table 2\" is more common in formal or academic writing, as it introduces the title of the table. The third and sixth translations omit the colon, which is acceptable in some contexts but less formal.\nConsidering these nuances, the best translation would be \"Table 2: Growth in Loans and Advances,\" as it combines the formal structure with a natural preposition and punctuation.\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of related loans in mainland China slightly decreased by 0.2% to HKD 455.3 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 內地相關貸款增長\nReview of the translations:\nThe original phrase \"表 3 內地相關貸款增長\" translates to \"Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"Table 3: Mainland China Related Loan Growth\" is concise but places \"Mainland China\" after \"Related Loan Growth,\" which may be slightly awkward in English phrasing.\nTranslation 2: \"Table 3 Growth of Related Loans Domestically\" uses \"Domestically\" instead of \"in Mainland China,\" which is less precise and may be confusing, as \"domestically\" can refer to within a country in general, not specifically Mainland China.\nTranslation 3: \"Mainland China's related loan growth (as shown in Table 3)\" reorders the phrase and adds a parenthetical note, which is unnecessary and changes the original structure.\nTranslation 4: \"Table 3 Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\" is accurate and natural, though it omits the colon after \"Table 3,\" which is standard in English for such headings.\nTranslation 5: \"Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\" is the most accurate and natural translation, correctly using the colon and placing the location at the end, which is standard in English for table titles.\nTranslation 6: \"Table 3: Domestic-Related Loan Growth\" uses \"Domestic-Related,\" which is not a standard term and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the phrasing.\nReasoning for improvement:\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard English phrasing for table titles. It should clearly indicate that the table is about the growth of related loans in Mainland China. The most appropriate structure is \"Table 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China,\" as it follows standard English conventions and accurately reflects the original Chinese.\nImproved Translation:\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main idea: the slight deterioration in asset quality of institutions due to the pandemic, the increase in specific classified loan ratios in the banking sector, and the comparison to historical averages.\n- The numerical data is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the translation of \"認可機構\" (accredited institutions, recognized institutions, regulated institutions, authorized institutions). While all are acceptable, \"accredited institutions\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Fluency and Precision:** Some translations use \"specific classified loan ratio\" or \"specific mention loans,\" which are not standard financial terms in English. The correct term is \"specific classification loan ratio\" or \"special mention loan ratio.\"\n- **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness:** The term \"sound level\" or \"prudent level\" is acceptable, but \"stable level\" is more commonly used in financial reporting.\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"during the year\" or \"for the year,\" which are both acceptable, but \"during the year\" is more natural in this context.\n- **Clarity in Time Reference:** The phrase \"a year ago\" is slightly less precise than \"compared to the previous year\" or \"from the previous year.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"accredited institutions\" for \"認可機構\" to maintain consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"special mention loan ratio\" for \"特定分類貸款比率\" to align with standard financial English.\n- Use \"stable level\" or \"healthy level\" for \"穩健水平\" to reflect the intended nuance.\n- Use \"compared to the previous year\" or \"from the previous year\" for clarity and precision in time reference.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and natural, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions has slightly deteriorated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The special mention loan ratio in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90% during the year, remaining at a stable level and far below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding loans related to mainland China, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% compared to the previous year to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic posing significant challenges to the economy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has thoroughly reviewed the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess trends of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has enhanced its monitoring of large borrowers and sectors more vulnerable to the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposures at both the industry and borrower levels. The special stress testing analysis conducted by the HKMA indicates that banks have the capacity to withstand the economic pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic assessment to review the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions across various areas, including loans related to mainland China, interbank loans, and secured loans to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressure\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the Banking Sector in October 2019. This mechanism introduced multiple rounds of relief measures to assist both corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers' financing needs in line with prudent risk management principles. The most significant initiative was the \"Pre-approved Interest-Only Repayment\" plan launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May, which allowed all eligible corporate customers to defer principal repayments for six months. The plan was extended by six months in November and further extended by six months in March 2021, ending on October 31. Approximately 100 banks participated in the plan, covering around 120,000 eligible corporate customers. By the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures for corporate customers, involving a total amount exceeding HK$740 billion.\nFor individual customers, banks also introduced a residential mortgage \"interest-only repayment\" plan, which included mortgages for properties under the Home Ownership Scheme. In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in industries severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan terms, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. By the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage \"interest-only repayment\" and other personal emergency loans, involving a total amount exceeding HK$44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\nThe original text is a simple heading: # 物業按揭貸款. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially the same: \"Property Mortgage Loan.\" The first and third through fifth translators used this exact phrase, while the second used \"Mortgage Loan for Property,\" which is slightly less common but still understandable. The sixth translator included the hashtag, mirroring the original format.\nStrengths of the translations include accuracy in conveying the core meaning—this is a loan related to property mortgages. The term \"Property Mortgage Loan\" is standard in financial contexts and is widely understood in English-speaking countries.\nHowever, the translations lack nuance and could be more natural in tone. \"Mortgage Loan for Property\" is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"Property Mortgage Loan.\" Additionally, none of the translations consider the possibility that \"物業\" might be better translated as \"real estate\" in certain contexts, though \"property\" is acceptable and commonly used in financial terminology.\nThe use of the hashtag (#) in the sixth translation is a direct mirror of the original, which may be appropriate if the context requires it, such as in social media or online listings. However, in formal or professional documents, the hashtag is typically omitted unless specifically needed.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"Property Mortgage Loan,\" as it is concise, accurate, and idiomatic. If the hashtag is necessary for formatting or context, it can be retained as \"#Property Mortgage Loan.\" Otherwise, the hashtag can be omitted for a cleaner, more professional appearance.\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened banks' risk management and enhanced the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system to a sudden reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% in September 2009 before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced. The average LTV ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, primarily due to a higher proportion of loans involving mortgage insurance, which typically carry higher LTV ratios. The average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio for newly approved mortgages also remained at a low level, standing at 37% in December, compared to 41% when the DTI ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the six translations provided, each captures the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to formal English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the relaxation of countercyclical macroprudential measures, the 10 percentage point increase in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap, and the specific adjustment from 40% to 50% for general cases.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"loan-to-value ratio,\" \"macroprudential measures,\" and \"countercyclical.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for such loans by 10 percentage points\" followed by \"raising the cap for general cases from 40% to 50%.\" This can be streamlined.\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some use \"relaxed\" while others use \"eased\" or \"loosened.\" While all are acceptable, \"relaxed\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **Clarity of \"economic fundamentals\" vs. \"economic conditions\":** The original uses \"經濟基調,\" which is more accurately translated as \"economic fundamentals\" or \"economic outlook\" rather than \"economic conditions.\"\n- **Use of \"external environment\" vs. \"external factors\":** \"External environment\" is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Punctuation and flow:** Some translations use commas in a way that disrupts the flow, such as \"raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for such loans by 10 percentage points, increasing the cap for general cases from 40% to 50%.\" This can be combined more smoothly.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent and precise terminology.\n- Streamline sentence structure to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure clarity in translating financial and regulatory terms.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for regulatory announcements.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nTaking into account the price trends and transaction volumes of non-residential properties, as well as economic fundamentals and external environments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority relaxed its countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans in August, increasing the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap by 10 percentage points. The general case ceiling was raised from 40% to 50%.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nIn response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to safeguard the health of employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. Additionally, the HKMA reminded authorized institutions to enhance communication with employees and customers, prepare for potential confirmed cases at their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more severe but potentially occurring risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and required authorized institutions to remain vigilant, regularly reviewing their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments in the pandemic and government social distancing measures.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, structure, and fluency that affect the overall quality and consistency of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the timeline and key components of the \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0.\"\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms such as \"comprehensive review,\" \"extensive industry consultation,\" and \"user-friendly.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the translation of the program's name. Some use \"Cyber Defence Plan,\" others use \"Cyber Defense Program,\" \"Cybersecurity Protection Plan,\" \"Cybersecurity Preparedness Programme,\" or \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\" The original text uses \"網絡防衛計劃,\" which should be consistently translated as \"Cyber Defence Plan\" to maintain clarity and professionalism.\n- **Structure and Flow:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the scope of the qualification certification list was expanded\" or \"the scope of the recognised qualifications has been expanded.\" A more natural phrasing would be \"the scope of the qualification certification list was expanded to include.\"\n- **Cultural and Institutional Accuracy:** The term \"香港銀行公會\" is translated as \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" in some translations and \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" in others. The correct and commonly used term is \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association).\"\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the programme in line with the latest international practices in overseas cyber risk management\" or \"the framework in line with the latest international practices in overseas cyber risk management.\" This can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Use \"Cyber Defence Plan\" consistently throughout the translation.\n- **Natural Flow and Grammar:** Use more natural phrasing, such as \"the scope of the qualification certification list was expanded to include\" instead of \"the scope of the qualification certification list was expanded.\"\n- **Cultural and Institutional Accuracy:** Use \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association)\" as the standard term.\n- **Conciseness and Clarity:** Avoid redundancy and ensure that the translation is concise and clear.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFollowing a comprehensive review of the \"Cyber Defence Plan\" and extensive industry consultations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" in November, further enhancing the original plan in line with the latest international practices in overseas cyber risk management. The \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" within the plan incorporates the latest internationally recognized robust practices regarding cyber incident response and recovery. Under the \"Cyber Defence Plan,\" the \"Professional Training Programme\" has expanded its qualification accreditation list to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas jurisdictions. The HKMA also proposed several recommendations to the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association) to make the \"Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform\" more user-friendly. The \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nAfter reviewing the six translations, it is evident that all of them capture the core meaning of the original text with a high degree of accuracy. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and the use of idiomatic expressions that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nThe first translation is clear and grammatically sound, but it uses \"have already commenced operations this year,\" which is slightly redundant. The second translation improves on this by using \"launched operations this year,\" which is more concise and natural. It also uses \"gamification elements,\" a more precise term than \"game elements\" or \"gaming elements.\"\nThe third translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"within the year\" instead of \"this year,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The fourth translation is the most polished, using \"enhanced customer experiences\" and \"thereby accelerating the loan approval process,\" which adds a more fluid and natural flow to the sentence. It also uses \"gamification elements,\" which is the most accurate term in this context.\nThe fifth translation uses \"savings accounts\" instead of \"fixed deposits,\" which is a slight misinterpretation of the original term. The sixth translation is very close to the fourth but uses \"approval process\" without the \"loan\" qualifier, which could be slightly ambiguous.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural phrasing, precise terminology, and fluent structure. It should use \"gamification elements\" for accuracy, avoid redundancy, and ensure that the sentence flow is smooth and natural in English.\nFinal Translation:\nAfter undergoing rigorous testing and trials within the \"FinTech Regulatory Sandbox,\" all eight virtual banks that received banking licenses in 2019 have launched operations this year. These virtual banks leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced customer experiences, such as utilizing big data analytics for credit evaluation of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loans, thereby accelerating the loan approval process. To enhance customer engagement and foster brand loyalty, some virtual banks have incorporated gamification elements into their services, including fixed deposits and reward programs.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a series of measures to ensure the continued smooth functioning of the interbank market and the banking system during the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the \"HKMA Liquidity Arrangement,\" introducing a temporary USD liquidity arrangement, and reaffirming the flexibility for recognized institutions to utilize liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted drills with recognized institutions to ensure they are prepared to implement these measures when necessary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent, but there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization that can be refined for optimal clarity and professionalism. The use of \"Centre\" versus \"Center\" is a matter of British versus American English spelling, but since the original text is in Traditional Chinese, which is more commonly associated with British English conventions, \"Centre\" may be more appropriate. However, \"Center\" is also widely understood and used globally, so either is acceptable depending on the target audience.\nAdditionally, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in the sixth translation is unnecessary unless it is intended for use in a specific format such as a heading in a markdown document. Since the original text does not include this symbol, it should be omitted in the final translation.\nThe capitalization of \"Status\" is consistent across all translations, which is appropriate for a title. However, in some contexts, \"status\" might be lowercase if it is not the first word in a title or heading. In this case, since it is the main title, capitalization is correct.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning accurately. The word \"status\" is appropriately used to denote the position or standing of Hong Kong as an international financial center.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be to use \"Centre\" to align with British English conventions, omit the \"#\" symbol, and ensure that the title is presented in a clean and professional format. Therefore, the improved translation would be:\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial center. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (TransferFast) surged sharply during the year.\n\nHong Kong, strategically positioned at the forefront of China's financial market opening-up, is well-placed to fully capitalize on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class market infrastructure and mechanisms such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and Bond Connect, Hong Kong serves not only as a highly favored fundraising platform for mainland enterprises but also as a gateway for international investors to access mainland China's rapidly growing market. This year has seen significant progress in promoting financial cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents' access to financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong's financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and sustainable finance. The HKMA is also intensifying its market promotion efforts to promote Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On a global scale, the HKMA plays a leading role in multiple regional and international committees, fully highlighting Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in relevant international initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as an Asian fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment sectors. Key developments this year include:\n- Promoting wider adoption of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (TransferFast);\n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement open application programming interfaces (open APIs);\n- Connecting the trade finance platform \"TradeLink\" with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to promote the digitization of trade finance;\n- Researching the application of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in cross-border payments;\n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Commercial Data Exchange\" and researching new types of credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access financing;\n- Announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a more scalable and diverse compliance technology (RegTech) ecosystem, further promoting the application of RegTech;\n- Strengthening talent development; and\n- Advancing cross-border fintech cooperation.\n\nThe original sentence is about the role of the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in promoting certain measures, in collaboration with the HKMA's banking departments. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Translation 1** correctly identifies the FFO as part of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, but this is inaccurate. The FFO is actually part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), not the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau.\n**Translation 2** correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA and uses \"playing a key role\" in the present tense, which is appropriate. However, it uses \"Office for Promoting Financial Technology\" instead of the more commonly used \"Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO),\" which may be less familiar to English readers.\n**Translation 3** incorrectly refers to the FFO as part of the \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is not the correct entity in this context. This is a significant error in institutional identification.\n**Translation 4** correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA and uses \"played a key role\" in the past tense. However, the original sentence does not specify a time frame, so the use of past tense may be unnecessary unless the context implies a completed action.\n**Translation 5** correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA and uses \"plays a key role\" in the present tense, which is appropriate. It also uses the correct name \"Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO),\" which is more precise than \"Office for Promoting Financial Technology.\"\n**Translation 6** is similar to Translation 5 but uses the past tense \"worked in collaboration\" and \"played a key role,\" which may not align with the original sentence's neutral time frame.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should accurately identify the FFO as part of the HKMA, use the correct name \"Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO),\" and maintain a neutral tense unless the context implies a specific time frame. The use of \"plays a key role\" in the present tense is appropriate for a general statement about the FFO's ongoing role.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), in collaboration with its various banking departments, plays a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include mainland onshore securities or increase their weightings, the inflow of funds into RMB-denominated assets continues to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in facilitating increased allocation to RMB assets by international investors, thanks to its connectivity with mainland capital markets through the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect.\" In 2020, the average daily trading volume of \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching approximately RMB 19.3 billion. To enhance the operation of \"Bond Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced new measures, including the establishment of a new special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours, and new arrangements offering investors greater flexibility in choosing banks for currency exchange and foreign exchange hedging. Following the successful implementation of the northbound component of \"Bond Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has formed a working group with the People's Bank of China to study the framework for the southbound component.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to strengthen financial cooperation with mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), including the implementation of the \"Wealth Management Connect\" initiative and the continued prominence of Hong Kong as a global offshore RMB hub. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and terminology usage.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (e.g., HKMA, People's Bank of China, Macao Monetary Authority) and the main initiatives (e.g., \"Wealth Management Connect\").\n- Most translations accurately reflect the financial terms, such as \"Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)\" and \"offshore RMB business hub.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"financial support measures\" instead of \"financial arrangements\" or \"financial connectivity,\" which may not fully capture the nuance of the original Chinese term.\n- **Translation 2** is very close to the original in terms of structure and terminology, but uses \"initiative\" for \"Wealth Management Connect,\" which is slightly less precise than \"scheme\" or \"program.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"financial connectivity\" and \"scheme\" for \"Wealth Management Connect,\" which are more precise. However, it uses \"Macao SAR\" instead of \"Macao Monetary Authority,\" which is less consistent with the original text.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"AMCM\" for \"Monetary Authority of Macau,\" which is not a standard abbreviation and may confuse readers.\n- **Translation 5** contains a critical error by translating \"Wealth Management Connect\" as \"Lifestyle program,\" which is completely inaccurate and misleading.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"financial facilitation measures\" and \"Cross-Boundary Wealth Management Connect,\" which aligns well with the original text. It also uses \"RMB 1.2 trillion\" correctly, which is more precise than \"120 billion yuan.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"financial connectivity\" or \"financial arrangements\" to capture the nuance of the original Chinese term.\n- Ensure consistency in the naming of institutions, such as \"Macao Monetary Authority\" rather than \"Macao SAR\" or \"AMCM.\"\n- Use \"Wealth Management Connect\" without adding unnecessary terms like \"initiative\" or \"scheme.\"\n- Ensure numerical accuracy, using \"RMB 1.2 trillion\" instead of \"120 billion yuan\" to avoid confusion.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, as is appropriate for a financial authority like the HKMA.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while correcting the minor inconsistencies and errors.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to enhance financial arrangements between Hong Kong and mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have announced a series of policy measures to support financial development in the region. In June, the People's Bank of China, the HKMA, and the Macao Monetary Authority jointly announced the implementation of the cross-border \"Wealth Management Connect\" program. The HKMA has been working closely with mainland and local authorities, as well as industry participants, to formulate the detailed implementation rules. The HKMA is also maintaining communication with mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand the policy space for Hong Kong banks to broaden the scope of their cross-border business. Throughout the year, Hong Kong has continued to maintain its position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The average daily transaction volume of Hong Kong’s RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of RMB 1.2 trillion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional tone.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately reflect its initiatives.\n- The key points—exploring new opportunities, enhancing competitiveness, creating a favorable environment for funds, promoting green finance, and market promotion—are consistently captured.\n- The use of terms like \"green and sustainable finance\" and \"financial platform\" is appropriate and aligns with the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Consistency:** Some translations use present continuous (\"is working,\" \"is intensifying\") while others use simple present (\"collaborates,\" \"strengthens\"), which can affect the tone and flow. A consistent tense (e.g., present continuous) would enhance readability.\n- **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"to promote the development of the fund industry in Hong Kong\" are repeated in multiple translations, which can be streamlined for conciseness.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Establishing operations locally\" and \"establishing a presence locally\" are both acceptable, but \"establishing a presence\" is more idiomatic in this context.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"stakeholders\" is used consistently, which is appropriate in a formal business context. However, \"overseas and mainland stakeholders\" is slightly awkward; \"overseas and mainland China stakeholders\" or \"overseas and Mainland Chinese stakeholders\" might be more natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent verb tenses (e.g., present continuous) for a more dynamic and professional tone.\n- Replace repetitive phrases with more concise alternatives.\n- Opt for more idiomatic expressions such as \"establishing a presence\" and \"showcasing financial services.\"\n- Ensure clarity and natural phrasing in references to stakeholders and geographical regions.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund industry in Hong Kong, the HKMA is working closely with the government and industry stakeholders to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish a presence locally. The HKMA is also dedicating significant effort to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a leading regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA is intensifying its market promotion efforts to showcase Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China.\n\nIn the field of central banking, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA serves as the Chair of the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and as the Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Meeting (EMEAP). The HKMA also acts as Co-Chair of the Non-Bank Monitoring Expert Group under the Financial Stability Board and of the Financial Innovation Network, and leads a working group examining regulatory issues related to the transition of benchmarks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is about the reliability and performance of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure, particularly in 2020. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and accuracy that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key components of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure, including the RTGS systems, CMU system, and Hong Kong Repository.\n- The translations generally maintain the structure and intent of the original text, emphasizing the 100% system availability in 2020 and the role of the CMU system in facilitating \"Bond Connect\" transactions.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"system availability rate\" and \"central securities depositories.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** There is inconsistency in the translation of \"CMU system.\" Some translations use \"Central Maturity Unit,\" others use \"Central Money Market Unit,\" and one even uses \"Central Movable Property System,\" which is incorrect. The correct term is \"Central Maturity Unit (CMU)\" or \"Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU system).\"\n- **Inaccurate Institutional Names:** The third and fourth translations incorrectly refer to the Hong Kong Repository as the \"Hong Kong Securities and Clearing Company\" or \"Hong Kong Securities Clearing and Settlement System,\" which are not accurate names for the institution described in the original text.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more fluent and natural than others. For example, the first and third translations use more natural phrasing, such as \"forms a solid foundation\" and \"lays a solid foundation,\" which are more idiomatic in English.\n- **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness:** The term \"Bond Connect\" is correctly translated in most cases, but the use of quotation marks and the placement of the term (e.g., \"northbound 'Bond Connect' transactions\") vary slightly, with some translations being more consistent with standard financial terminology.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the correct and consistent terminology for the CMU system, ensuring it is referred to as the \"Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU system)\" or \"Central Maturity Unit (CMU system).\"\n- Accurately translate the name of the Hong Kong Repository, using \"Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository)\" as in the original.\n- Ensure that the term \"Bond Connect\" is used consistently and appropriately, with quotation marks and placement that align with standard financial reporting.\n- Improve fluency by using natural English phrasing, such as \"forms a solid foundation\" or \"provides a solid foundation,\" and avoid overly literal translations that may sound awkward in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure forms a solid foundation for its status as an international financial center. In 2020, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository) achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU system continued to facilitate the settlement of northbound \"Bond Connect\" transactions and held mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU system members.\n\nThe original text discusses the continued growth of a payment system (likely \"轉數快,\" or Faster Payment System) in 2020, highlighting the increase in registrations, transaction volume, and the factors contributing to its growth. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses of the Translations:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"Faster Payments\" consistently. However, it uses \"doubled\" instead of \"increased two times,\" which is slightly less precise in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 2** introduces \"Faster Payments System (FPS)\" with the acronym, which is appropriate. It uses \"more than doubling\" instead of \"doubled,\" which is more precise. However, it lacks the term \"transaction value\" in the first sentence, which is important for clarity.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"increasing threefold,\" which is incorrect since the original text says \"上升兩倍\" (increased two times, i.e., doubled). This is a critical error.\n- **Translation 4** is accurate and fluent, using \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"increasing threefold\" is corrected to \"increasing threefold\" but the original says \"上升兩倍\" (doubled), so this is also incorrect. It uses \"beyond the steady growth\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"PayMe\" instead of \"Faster Payment System,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"increasing by two times,\" which is not standard in English financial contexts.\n- **Translation 6** uses the literal Chinese name \"Zhuanshu Kuai\" instead of the correct English term \"Faster Payment System (FPS),\" which is unprofessional and confusing.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct English name for the system: \"Faster Payment System (FPS).\"\n- Accurately reflect the increase in transaction volume as \"doubled\" or \"increased two times.\"\n- Use precise financial terminology such as \"transaction value\" or \"transaction volume.\"\n- Maintain fluency and natural English structure.\n- Avoid literal translations of Chinese terms that are not recognized in English financial contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe use of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. By the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded, with the annual transaction volume doubling compared to 2019. The government's acceptance of FPS for payments and the increasing adoption by more merchants were the main reasons for the significant growth in transaction value, in addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designates and supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 licensed stored value facility operators.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as Asia's Fintech Hub\nThe original Chinese title, \"# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位,\" translates to a heading that emphasizes Hong Kong's role as a central or pivotal point in Asia's fintech landscape. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first translation, \"Hong Kong's Position as an Asian Financial Technology Hub,\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, \"Financial Technology\" is a more formal and less commonly used term compared to \"Fintech,\" which is widely recognized in the industry.\nThe second translation, \"Hong Kong's Position as an Asian Fintech Hub,\" improves upon the first by using the more concise and industry-standard term \"Fintech.\" However, \"Position\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"地位\" (status or standing), which implies a more established or respected role.\nThe third translation, \"# Hong Kong's Status as Asia's Fintech Hub,\" is concise and uses \"Status,\" which better reflects \"地位.\" The use of \"Asia's\" instead of \"Asian\" is more natural in this context, as it emphasizes Hong Kong's role within Asia rather than its geographical relation to Asia. However, the inclusion of the hashtag \"#\" may be unnecessary unless the title is intended for social media or a specific platform.\nThe fourth translation, \"Hong Kong's Status as an Asian Financial Technology Hub,\" combines the strengths of the first and third translations by using \"Status\" and \"Financial Technology.\" However, it still uses the less common term \"Financial Technology\" instead of \"Fintech.\"\nThe fifth translation, \"# Hong Kong's Position as Asia's FinTech Hub,\" is similar to the third but uses \"Position\" instead of \"Status,\" which is less precise in capturing the meaning of \"地位.\"\nThe sixth translation, \"Hong Kong's position as an Asian FinTech hub,\" is grammatically correct and uses the more modern term \"FinTech.\" However, it lacks the capitalization and punctuation that might be expected in a formal title.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation should use \"Status\" to reflect \"地位,\" \"Fintech\" for conciseness and industry relevance, and \"Asia's\" to emphasize Hong Kong's role within Asia. The hashtag \"#\" can be omitted unless it is specifically required for formatting purposes.\nTherefore, the improved translation would be: \"Hong Kong's Status as Asia's Fintech Hub.\" This version is concise, uses industry-standard terminology, and accurately reflects the original Chinese title's meaning and nuance.\n\n# Fast-paced\n\nSince its launch in September 2018, the Faster Payment System (FPS) has attracted the participation of 35 banks and 12 e-money operators, with five additional banks and one more e-money operator joining in 2020. FPS usage has also steadily increased. As of December 31, FPS had recorded a total of 6.9 million registrations (Figure 1). To facilitate the public in receiving payments from institutions, FPS introduced the option to use Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers starting December 6. Within less than a month after this feature was introduced, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new feature is not intended for person-to-person transfers, but rather for institutions to make payments to individuals whose ID numbers are already on file (e.g., salary disbursements). Since each citizen's Identity Card number is unique, using it as an account identifier ensures accurate receipt of payments even without providing a bank account number.\n\nFigure 1: Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Accounts\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase \"轉數快帳戶登記數目\" translates to \"Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Accounts.\" The term \"轉數快\" is a colloquial or brand-specific term in Hong Kong, referring to a fast payment system. It is best translated as \"Quick Transfer\" to preserve the intended meaning and cultural context.\n- **Translation 1:** \"Number of Registrations for Quick Account Service\" is somewhat vague. \"Quick Account Service\" lacks specificity and does not clearly convey the \"transfer\" aspect of the service.\n- **Translation 2:** \"Number of Fast Account Registrations\" is concise but omits the \"transfer\" component, which is crucial to the meaning of \"轉數快.\"\n- **Translation 3:** \"Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Account\" is accurate but slightly awkward due to the singular \"Account\" when the context likely refers to multiple accounts.\n- **Translation 4:** \"Number of Fast Transfer Account Registrations\" is grammatically correct but uses \"Fast Transfer\" instead of \"Quick Transfer,\" which may not align with the intended branding.\n- **Translation 5:** \"Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Accounts\" is the most accurate and natural, using the plural \"Accounts\" and preserving the term \"Quick Transfer.\"\n- **Translation 6:** \"Number of account registrations with rapid transaction volume\" is overly wordy and misrepresents the original phrase, which refers to the number of registrations, not transaction volume.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 1: Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Accounts\nThis translation is concise, accurate, and maintains the intended meaning and cultural context of the original phrase.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, which discusses the surge in electronic payment usage, particularly the \"轉數快\" (FPS) system, driven by the pandemic and social distancing measures. However, there are notable differences in terminology, numerical accuracy, and fluency that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key factors driving the increase in electronic payments: the pandemic and social distancing.\n- They all mention the significant growth in FPS transaction volumes, with specific figures for December 2020, December 2019, and October 2018.\n- The evolution of FPS from person-to-person payments to broader applications is consistently conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** There is inconsistency in the name of the system. Some use \"Quick Pay,\" others use \"FPS\" (Faster Payment System), and one even uses \"Fast Payment System.\" The correct and most commonly used term in official contexts is \"FPS\" or \"Faster Payment System.\"\n- **Numerical accuracy:** The fourth translation incorrectly states that the first month of FPS had 50,000 transactions, whereas the original text clearly states it was 10 times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, implying the first month had 16,800 transactions.\n- **Fluency and style:** Some translations are more fluent and natural than others. For example, the first and fifth translations use more natural phrasing, while the fourth translation is slightly awkward in its structure.\n- **Cultural and contextual appropriateness:** The term \"real-time transactions\" is more precise than \"instant transactions,\" and \"HKD\" is preferred over \"HK$\" in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use the official name \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" consistently.\n- Ensure numerical accuracy, particularly regarding the first month of FPS.\n- Use \"real-time transactions\" instead of \"instant transactions\" for precision.\n- Maintain a natural, fluent tone with appropriate use of prepositions and phrasing.\n- Ensure clarity in comparisons (e.g., \"three times that of\" vs. \"three times the\").\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures have provided new momentum for the use of electronic payment services. The volume of Faster Payment System (FPS) transactions grew particularly rapidly this year (Figure 2), reaching an average of 505,000 real-time transactions per day in December 2020 (involving HKD 5.2 billion and RMB 95 million), which is three times the 168,000 transactions recorded in December 2019, and ten times the volume in October 2018, the first month of FPS launch. The increased usage of FPS has also benefited from the gradual expansion of its application scope, which evolved from initially being primarily used for person-to-person payments to gradually covering bill payments (including government bills), retail, and business transactions.\n\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\nThe original Chinese text is concise and technical: \"圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\". The key elements are \"圖 2\" (Figure 2), \"港元\" (Hong Kong Dollar), \"即時支付\" (instant payments), \"平均每日交易數字\" (average daily transaction figures\/numbers\/volume).\n**Review of the translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Figures for Real-Time Hong Kong Dollar Payments\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"Real-Time\" as a synonym for \"即時\" and \"Figures\" as a synonym for \"數字\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Real-Time\" is slightly more technical than \"instant,\" which may not be the most natural term in this context. Also, \"Figures\" is less commonly used in financial contexts than \"Volume\" or \"Numbers.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payment System\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Volume,\" which is a standard term in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Adds \"System\" which is not present in the original text and may be unnecessary.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Numbers for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Numbers\" as a direct translation of \"數字,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Numbers\" is less precise than \"Volume\" in financial terminology.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Real-Time Payments\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Volume\" and \"Real-Time\" as accurate terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Real-Time\" is more technical than \"instant,\" which may not align with the intended tone.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume of Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Volume\" and \"Instant Payments,\" which are both accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The preposition \"of\" is slightly less common than \"for\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 2: Average Daily Transaction Numbers for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Matches the third translation, using \"Numbers\" and \"Instant Payments.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the third translation, \"Numbers\" is less precise than \"Volume.\"\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use standard financial terminology. \"Volume\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"Numbers\" or \"Figures\" when referring to transaction data. \"Instant Payments\" is a more natural and widely used term than \"Real-Time Payments\" in this context. The phrase \"Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\" is concise, accurate, and aligns with standard financial terminology.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: The term \"轉數快\" is translated inconsistently across the translations. Some use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" with the acronym, while others use \"Quick Pay\" or \"Fast Payment System (FPS).\" The official term in Hong Kong is \"Faster Payment System (FPS),\" and it is best to use this consistently to avoid confusion and ensure alignment with official sources.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: While all translations are grammatically sound, some are more fluent than others. For example, the first and fourth translations use more natural phrasing, such as \"provide convenience to the public\" and \"starting from December 21, 2020.\" Others use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"facilitate citizens' transactions\" or \"the arrangement of using FPS for online payments.\"\n3. **Vocabulary and Precision**: Some translations use more precise vocabulary. For instance, \"general government demand notes\" in the first translation is less precise than \"general government bills\" or \"general government fee notices\" used in others. The term \"general government bills\" is more commonly used and better understood in this context.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they accurately reflect the context of Hong Kong's financial services and government operations. However, the use of \"HK$2.2 billion\" is more standard than \"HKD 2.2 billion\" in formal writing.\n5. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some translations are more concise and direct. For example, the fourth translation uses \"starting from December 21, 2020\" instead of \"from December 21, 2020,\" which is slightly more natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been collaborating with multiple government departments and the banking sector to expand the application of the Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant transactions. Since November 2019, the government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote its use and provide convenience to the public. Citizens can easily pay taxes, rates, land rent, water bills, and general government bills by scanning the QR codes printed on the bills using mobile banking apps or e-wallets that support FPS. As of December 2020, there were 1.8 million FPS transactions for government bill payments, totaling HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four more government departments began accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service machines starting from December 21, 2020. The government is also currently exploring arrangements for using FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is the increasing adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS) by businesses of all sizes to enhance their operational efficiency. The number of transactions processed by payment merchants surged sharply in December 2020, averaging 100,000 per day, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is commonly used for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and other online shopping activities. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also significantly boosted the volume of transactions involving FPS for account top-ups. In December 2020, the average daily volume of top-up transactions was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public awareness of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced a variety of educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of smart usage tips on social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a WhatsApp Sticker design competition for secondary school students to increase their understanding of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA has promoted the use of FPS for payments among various charitable organizations and market operators. Many banks and stored value payment tool operators participating in FPS have also launched promotional campaigns, including offering incentives to encourage customers to register and use FPS for transfers and bill payments. Building on the achievements of 2020, the HKMA collaborated with banks and stored value payment tool operators at the beginning of 2021 to promote the electronic distribution of red envelopes via FPS. On one hand, the HKMA launched promotional campaigns, while banks and stored value payment tool operators provided incentives to encourage customers to distribute red envelopes electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helpful in combating the pandemic.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and lexical precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the concept of open APIs and their phased implementation.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"open APIs,\" \"third-party service providers,\" and \"innovative services.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"application programming interfaces (APIs)\" in full on first mention, which is good, but the phrase \"the banking sector’s development and provision\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"the banking sector in developing and providing\" which is grammatically incorrect; \"in\" should be \"to\" or \"for.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the banking industry\" instead of \"banking sector,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this context. Also, \"conducting research and investigation\" is redundant.\n- **Translation 4** has a similar issue with \"the banking industry in developing and providing\" and uses \"developed various innovative services\" which is slightly passive.\n- **Translation 5** is the most fluent and accurate, using \"the banking sector\" consistently and \"enhance customer experiences\" (plural) which is more natural than \"customer experience\" (singular).\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" inconsistently. It also uses \"research and surveys\" which is redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the correct full name of the authority on first mention and maintain consistency.\n- The phrase \"developing and providing open APIs\" should be used with the correct preposition (\"to\" or \"for\").\n- \"Customer experience\" should be plural (\"customer experiences\") to match the plural \"services.\"\n- \"Conducting research and investigation\" should be simplified to \"conducting research\" to avoid redundancy.\n- \"Published a booklet\" is more natural than \"published a brochure\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"in accordance with the open API framework\" is more natural than \"according to the open API framework.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while correcting the grammatical and lexical issues identified.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to promote the development and provision of open APIs by the banking sector in accordance with the open API framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, with banks having already launched the first and second phases of open APIs. These open APIs are being used to collaborate with third-party service providers to develop a range of innovative services and enhance customer experiences. On the other hand, the HKMA is conducting research on the implementation of the third and fourth phases of open APIs and published a booklet in November detailing the survey results.\n\n# Trade Linkage\n\nTo provide importers and exporters with more convenient trade financing services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a proof-of-concept study this year to explore connecting \"TradeLink\" with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, followed by the commencement of trials. Hong Kong and mainland banks have since successfully completed multiple cross-border trade financing transactions using this connection.\n\n# Cross-border payment(s) is a term that can be translated in multiple ways depending on context. The junior translators have provided several variations, including singular and plural forms, with and without the hashtag symbol. \nThe first translation, \"Cross-border payment,\" uses the singular form, which may be appropriate in contexts referring to a single transaction. However, in broader discussions about financial systems or services, the plural form \"cross-border payments\" is more commonly used and better reflects the general concept.\nThe second translation, \"# Cross-border Payments,\" includes a hashtag, which may be suitable for social media or online content but is unnecessary in formal or technical contexts. The third and sixth translations use the plural form without a hashtag, which is more neutral and appropriate for general use.\nThe fourth and fifth translations use the singular form without a hashtag, which may be less suitable for general discussions about the topic. The choice between singular and plural depends on the intended scope of the term—whether it refers to a single transaction or the broader system of international financial transfers.\nConsidering these observations, the most appropriate translation would be \"Cross-border payments,\" using the plural form without a hashtag, as it is the most neutral and widely accepted form in both formal and informal contexts. This translation accurately reflects the general concept of international financial transactions and is grammatically correct and culturally appropriate.\n\nRegarding central bank digital currencies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand continue to conduct joint research to explore the application of central bank digital currencies in cross-border payments, thereby facilitating the simultaneous settlement of Hong Kong dollar and Thai baht foreign exchange transactions between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. The two parties have completed the first phase of research and published a joint report in January outlining the key findings; they have also developed a prototype cross-border corridor network based on blockchain technology, aiming to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of cross-border payments. The second phase of the project has commenced, focusing on exploring commercial application cases for cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks have also expressed considerable interest in the project. The Bank for International Settlements, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China announced their participation in the project in early 2021.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2020 was a year of dramatic twists and turns, as the novel coronavirus pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After experiencing significant adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, asset markets rebounded rapidly, driven by ultra-loose monetary policies introduced by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments around the world. With major central banks significantly lowering benchmark interest rates and restarting quantitative easing, government bond yields fell sharply while bond prices rose. In this investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 235.8 billion in 2020, with a return rate of 5.3%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the delegated powers and the terms of such delegation granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and stylistic appropriateness. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically sound. However, \"Protecting capital\" is less formal than \"Preserving capital\" or \"Safeguarding capital,\" which are more commonly used in financial contexts. The phrase \"at all times\" is repeated unnecessarily in (b), which slightly affects fluency.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is well-structured and uses \"Preserving capital,\" which is appropriate. However, \"to the fullest extent possible\" is slightly wordy and less idiomatic than \"as far as possible\" or \"as much as possible.\" Also, \"the Fund\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The use of \"to preserve capital\" is grammatically correct but less formal than \"Preserving capital\" in this context. The phrase \"to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained\" is awkward and could be improved to \"to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained\" or \"to ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"Preservation of capital,\" which is appropriate. The structure is consistent, and the use of \"as far as possible\" is idiomatic. However, \"U.S. dollar assets\" is slightly more formal than \"US dollar assets,\" which is acceptable but not essential.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is grammatically correct and uses \"To safeguard capital,\" which is appropriate. However, \"To ensure that liquidity is sufficient\" is slightly awkward and could be improved to \"to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available\" or \"to ensure sufficient liquidity.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. However, it unnecessarily adds \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's\" to the beginning, which may not be required unless the context specifically demands it. Also, \"dollar assets\" is less precise than \"U.S. dollar assets.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and use appropriate financial terminology. It should avoid redundancy, maintain consistency in capitalization, and use idiomatic expressions. Based on the above review, the fourth and sixth translations are the strongest, but the fourth is more concise and avoids unnecessary elaboration. The phrase \"Preservation of capital\" is more formal and appropriate in this context. The use of \"as far as possible\" is idiomatic and natural. The structure is consistent, and the translation accurately reflects the original meaning.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) Preservation of capital;\n(b) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) Ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Seeking investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe original sentence is formal and technical, discussing the alignment of objectives with the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and their reflection in portfolio structure and asset allocation. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, conciseness, and precision.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but uses \"the aforementioned objectives\" which is slightly formal and less common in modern English. It also repeats \"the foreign exchange fund\" unnecessarily.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently and correctly, but \"composition structure\" is awkward phrasing; \"portfolio structure\" is more standard. It also repeats \"Exchange Fund\" twice, which is redundant.\n**Translation 3** is concise and natural, using \"fully consider\" and \"its\" to avoid repetition. It is fluent and accurate, though \"fully\" may be slightly less precise than \"comprehensively\" in a formal context.\n**Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 3, but uses \"These objectives\" instead of \"The aforementioned objectives,\" which is more natural in English. It also uses \"are reflected\" instead of \"have been reflected,\" which is slightly less precise in terms of tense and passive voice.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and clear, but again repeats \"the Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily. It uses \"fully take into account,\" which is slightly more verbose than \"fully consider.\"\n**Translation 6** is the most concise and natural, using \"comprehensively address\" which is a strong and appropriate verb in this context. It avoids repetition by using \"the Fund’s\" and \"its,\" and the sentence flows well.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"comprehensively address\" or \"fully consider\" as the most appropriate verb.\n- Avoid repetition of \"the Exchange Fund\" by using \"its\" or \"the Fund’s.\"\n- Use \"portfolio structure\" rather than \"composition structure.\"\n- Ensure the passive voice is used appropriately to reflect the formal tone of the original.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe original text describes the structure and function of the Exchange Fund, emphasizing its division into two portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. Each translation captures the basic structure and meaning, but there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and accuracy.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"monetary base\" and \"currency issuance regime\" appropriately. However, it uses \"monetary base\" consistently, which is correct, but could be more precise in some contexts.\n**Translation 2** uses \"currency authority system\" instead of \"currency issuance regime,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power,\" which is slightly wordy.\n**Translation 3** is concise and accurate, using \"USD\" and \"OECD\" appropriately. However, it uses \"debt and equity markets\" instead of \"bond and stock markets,\" which is acceptable but less specific.\n**Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"reserve portfolio\" instead of \"support portfolio,\" which is a significant error. It also uses \"monetary authority system\" and \"member countries of the OECD,\" which are acceptable but not as precise as \"currency board system\" or \"member economies of the OECD.\"\n**Translation 5** uses \"money supply\" instead of \"monetary base,\" which is a subtle but important difference. It also uses \"currency board system,\" which is more precise than \"currency issuance regime\" or \"currency authority system.\"\n**Translation 6** is the most precise, using \"currency board system\" and \"member economies of the OECD.\" It also uses \"preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets,\" which is more natural and concise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use precise terminology, maintain fluency, and accurately reflect the original meaning. \"Currency board system\" is more precise than \"currency issuance regime\" or \"currency authority system.\" \"Monetary base\" is more accurate than \"money supply.\" \"Bond and stock markets\" is more specific than \"debt and equity markets.\" \"Member economies of the OECD\" is more natural than \"member countries of the OECD.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the provisions of the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is capped at one-third of the Exchange Fund's accumulated surplus, plus the portion of future fund deposits and deposits of the Exchange Fund's subsidiaries that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe original text discusses the establishment and purpose of the Strategic Asset Portfolio, emphasizing its unique nature and its exclusion from the investment performance evaluation of the Exchange Fund. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is clear and concise, with correct grammar and appropriate terminology. However, it uses \"has consistently held\" which, while correct, is slightly less natural than \"has continuously held\" or \"has been holding.\"\n**Translation 2** has a minor grammatical issue: \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes by the government\" is awkward and redundant. The phrase \"by the government\" is unnecessary since the government is already implied as the owner of the Exchange Fund.\n**Translation 3** is accurate and fluent, with a natural flow. It correctly uses \"under the Exchange Fund account\" and \"investment performance assessment.\" However, \"has been holding\" is slightly less formal than \"has continuously held.\"\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"consistently held\" and \"assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance,\" which are both natural and precise. However, it repeats \"performance\" twice, which is slightly redundant.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and fluent, with a natural flow. It correctly uses \"under the Exchange Fund's account\" and \"investment performance evaluation.\" However, \"continuously held\" is slightly less common than \"consistently held\" in formal writing.\n**Translation 6** is very accurate and fluent, with appropriate terminology. It correctly uses \"The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" and \"under the Exchange Fund account.\" However, it repeats \"investment performance\" twice, which is slightly redundant.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"consistently held\" or \"has continuously held\" for a more natural flow.\n- Avoid redundancy by not repeating \"performance\" unnecessarily.\n- Ensure clarity in the ownership structure, specifying that the government purchases shares under the Exchange Fund account.\n- Use \"The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" for full formality and accuracy.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be a version that is fluent, grammatically correct, and avoids redundancy while accurately reflecting the original meaning and structure.\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe original text discusses the Foreign Exchange Fund's acceptance of deposits and the interest rate structure for the Future Fund, which is a specific example of such deposits. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and accurate, but the phrase \"future fund is a primary example\" is slightly awkward. \"Primary example\" may not be the best choice here, as it implies the Future Fund is the main or only example, which may not be the intended nuance.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version uses \"major exception,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original text. The Future Fund is not an exception but rather a specific example of the rule. This is a significant error in meaning.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. The use of \"notable exception\" is more appropriate than \"major exception,\" though the original text does not explicitly state that the Future Fund is an exception. It is more of a specific case.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is concise and accurate. The use of \"prime example\" is appropriate, and the phrasing \"portfolio weighting\" is more natural than \"proportion of the portfolios.\" The final sentence is also well-structured.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate but uses \"major individual example,\" which is redundant and awkward. \"Individual example\" is unnecessary and does not add clarity.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. The use of \"from time to time\" is more natural than \"occasionally.\" The phrase \"weighting between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio\" is clear and precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and natural in English. It should avoid awkward phrasing and ensure that the meaning of the original text is preserved. The Future Fund is not an exception but a specific example of the rule, so terms like \"exception\" should be avoided. The phrase \"linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio\" is clear and accurate. The final sentence should clearly state the allocation ratio without unnecessary words.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. The Future Fund is a prime example of such deposits, with its interest rate linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio. The actual interest rate depends on the weighting of these portfolios, with the Future Fund allocated approximately 40% to the investment portfolio and 60% to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and terminology consistency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with a clear structure. It correctly uses \"tactical deviation\" and \"tracking error limits.\" However, it refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" as the one who sets the benchmark, which is slightly inaccurate—this role is typically held by the Chief Secretary for Finance in Hong Kong.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It correctly identifies the \"Chief Secretary for Finance\" as the person who sets the investment benchmark. However, it incorrectly refers to the \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation\" in the definition, which is a critical error in terminology.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"tactical deviation\" correctly and refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" as the person who sets the benchmark. However, it uses \"expressed in terms of\" instead of \"reflected as,\" which is slightly less idiomatic.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"tactical deviation\" and refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" as the person who sets the benchmark. However, it incorrectly states that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the \"strategic asset allocation,\" which is not accurate—this is typically the role of the Financial Secretary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"strategic deviation\" in the definition, which is a critical error in the second translation. However, it incorrectly refers to the \"Exchange Fund Consultation Committee\" instead of the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is a minor but important terminology issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"tactical deviation\" and refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" as the person who sets the benchmark. It also correctly identifies the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in determining \"tactical asset allocation\" and defining the permissible range for \"tactical deviation.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct terminology: \"tactical deviation\" and \"strategic allocation.\"\n- Accurately identify the \"Chief Secretary for Finance\" as the person who sets the investment benchmark.\n- Correctly identify the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" as the body consulted.\n- Accurately describe the roles of the Financial Secretary and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- Use natural, fluent English that reflects the formal tone of the original text.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations, ensuring correct terminology, accurate roles, and natural fluency.\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected as an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. Using strategic allocation as a guide, the Exchange Fund employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Chief Secretary for Finance, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to proper terminology and structure. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: \n   - The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth translations correctly identify the \"Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is the official name. However, the sixth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is not the correct authority in this context.\n   - The term \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is used in the fifth and sixth translations, but the official term is \"Exchange Fund.\" The use of \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is redundant and less precise.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - All translations are grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. For example, the third and fourth translations use smoother phrasing, such as \"through the use of derivatives\" and \"executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies.\"\n   - The first and second translations use \"implements\" and \"implements the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy,\" which is slightly less precise than \"executes\" or \"carries out\" in the context of risk management strategies.\n3. **Vocabulary and Nuance**:\n   - The term \"supporting portfolio\" is used in some translations, but \"supporting portfolio\" may not be the most accurate term. The original Chinese likely refers to a \"support portfolio\" or \"supporting component\" of the investment portfolio.\n   - The phrase \"the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio\" is slightly ambiguous. A clearer phrasing would be \"the entire support portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio.\"\n   - The use of \"derivative instruments\" is correct, but \"derivatives\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n4. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**:\n   - The correct institutional name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and the correct fund name is \"Exchange Fund.\" The fifth and sixth translations use \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is not the official term and may confuse readers.\n   - The term \"macro risk management strategy\" is appropriate, but \"macro risk management strategies\" (plural) is more consistent with the plural \"strategies\" used in the original.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office’s staff directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire support portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the portfolio includes various global fixed-income market investments and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the Exchange Fund, achieve sustainable returns, and enable the Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gain insights and specialized investment knowledge from the market.\n\nThe original Chinese text discusses the expenses associated with hiring external investment managers, listing specific costs and noting that these expenses fluctuate annually due to market factors. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, word choice, and structure that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the expenses: fund management and custody fees, transaction costs\/fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes.\n- The idea that these expenses vary annually due to market factors is consistently conveyed.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Transaction costs\" vs. \"transaction fees\":** While both are acceptable, \"transaction fees\" is more commonly used in financial contexts, making it more natural in this context.\n- **\"Vary from year to year\" vs. \"vary annually\":** Both are correct, but \"vary annually\" is more concise and commonly used in formal writing.\n- **\"Primarily influenced by market factors\" vs. \"primarily subject to market factors\":** \"Influenced by\" is more direct and natural than \"subject to\" in this context.\n- **Word order in the second sentence:** Some translations place \"primarily\" at the beginning of the second clause, which can slightly disrupt the flow. Placing it closer to the verb improves readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"transaction fees\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"vary annually\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"influenced by\" to maintain clarity and natural flow.\n- Ensure that the placement of adverbs like \"primarily\" enhances readability rather than disrupts it.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\n**Translation:**\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and structure. However, a critical evaluation reveals several areas for improvement:\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" while others use \"HKMA\" or \"Financial Supervisory Commission.\" The original text refers to \"金管局,\" which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), so consistency in using \"HKMA\" is essential for clarity and professionalism.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some phrases could be more natural in English. For example, \"has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers\" is accurate but slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing would enhance readability.\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**: One translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"HKMA.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct institution referenced in the original text.\n4. **Nuance and Precision**: The phrase \"has strengthened risk management procedures to align with the diversified investments of the Exchange Fund\" is slightly less precise than \"has enhanced risk management procedures to accommodate the diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments,\" which better reflects the original intent.\n5. **Clarity and Flow**: Some translations use \"three-line defense system\" while others use \"three-line-of-defense model.\" The latter is more commonly used in risk management literature and is more precise.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain consistency in terminology, use precise and commonly accepted terms in risk management, and ensure clarity and fluency in English.\nThe following is the improved translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English:\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA employs a three-line-of-defense model for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and oversight. It also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk—including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk—and has enhanced risk management procedures to accommodate the diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) support for responsible investment and its integration of ESG factors into the investment management of the Exchange Fund across both public and private markets. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, clarity, and grammatical precision.\n**Translation 1** is clear and grammatically correct, but the phrase \"public and private markets for the Exchange Fund\" could be misinterpreted as the markets belonging to the Exchange Fund, rather than the types of investments the Fund makes.\n**Translation 2** uses \"incorporates\" instead of \"integrates\" and places \"in both public and private market operations\" at the end, which slightly disrupts the flow. It is still understandable, but the structure is less direct.\n**Translation 3** uses \"integrates\" and \"for the Exchange Fund’s public and private market investments,\" which is more precise than \"for the Exchange Fund.\" However, the phrase \"investment management processes for\" is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"incorporating\" and places \"public and private markets\" correctly as the types of investments. It is fluent and accurate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"responsible investing\" instead of \"responsible investment,\" which is a minor stylistic choice. It also uses \"will incorporate,\" which implies a future action, whereas the original does not specify a timeline. This could be a slight misinterpretation.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 2 and is grammatically sound, but the placement of \"in both public and private markets\" at the end is slightly less direct than in Translation 4.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"integrates\" instead of \"incorporates\" for a more formal tone.\n- Clarify that the ESG factors are integrated into the investment management of the Exchange Fund, not the markets themselves.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"public and private markets\" refers to the types of investments, not the markets as entities.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment by integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management processes of the Exchange Fund’s public and private market investments.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, they vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Accuracy**: Most translations correctly use terms like \"ESG,\" \"responsible investment,\" and \"proxy voting.\" However, some translations use \"post-employment monitoring program\" (Translation 1) or \"post-appointment monitoring program\" (Translation 2, 4, 5, 6), which is more accurate. \"Post-appointment\" is the standard term in regulatory contexts.\n2. **Fluency and Readability**: Translation 4 and 5 are the most fluent, with natural sentence structures and appropriate use of prepositions and conjunctions. Translation 1 is slightly awkward in places, such as \"the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) Oversight Committee,\" which is incorrect; the correct body is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n3. **Cultural and Regulatory Appropriateness**: The term \"Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO)\" is a legal term in Hong Kong, but the correct body is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), not the SFO Oversight Committee. Translation 1 incorrectly refers to the SFO Oversight Committee, while Translation 6 correctly identifies the SFC.\n4. **Consistency**: Translation 6 uses \"investee companies\" instead of \"portfolio companies,\" which is a more precise term in investment management. It also correctly refers to \"China A-share portfolio\" rather than \"mainland China equity portfolio,\" which is more specific and accurate.\n5. **Nuance and Precision**: Translation 6 uses \"emerging market equity portfolios\" instead of \"developed market equity portfolios,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original text. The original refers to \"developed market equity portfolios,\" so this is a critical error.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should:\n- Use \"post-appointment monitoring program\" as the standard term.\n- Correctly identify the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) as the regulatory body.\n- Use precise terminology such as \"investee companies\" and \"portfolio companies.\"\n- Ensure consistency in referring to \"developed market equity portfolios.\"\n- Maintain a natural, fluent tone with appropriate sentence structure.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities associated with the Exchange Fund's investment projects. Regarding the portfolios managed by external investment managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through the appointed investment managers. Throughout the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external investment managers, the HKMA evaluates their implementation of various ESG aspects, including the organizational structure for ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and stewardship activities such as proxy voting and engagement with investee companies (for example, discussing ESG matters with the management of investee companies). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes more comprehensive ESG practices through the stewardship role played by external investment managers. External investment managers responsible for managing the HKMA’s Hong Kong equity portfolio and the actively managed China A-share portfolio are required to commit to adhering to the Securities and Futures Commission’s \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" and to provide explanations for any non-compliance. External investment managers responsible for managing developed market equity portfolios are required to adhere to internationally recognized ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA conducts post-appointment monitoring to review the implementation of proxy voting and engagement with investee companies by external investment managers.\n\nThe original text discusses how fixed-income investment portfolios managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) integrate ESG factors into credit risk analysis for bond investments, and how this integration is enhanced by expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" correctly and maintains the original structure. However, \"the relevant analysis is strengthened\" is slightly awkward and could be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. This is a critical error. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is also incorrect. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"HKMA\" is appropriately abbreviated. The translation is fluent and natural, with \"further strengthened\" being a slight improvement over \"strengthened.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Similar to the fourth, with \"HKMA\" correctly used. The use of \"integrate\" instead of \"incorporate\" is a minor stylistic choice but acceptable. \"Further strengthened\" is a good choice.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"internal staff.\" The phrase \"This is achieved by...\" is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The use of \"thereby strengthening the related analysis\" is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the HKMA.\n- Use natural and fluent English.\n- Maintain the original meaning and nuance.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\nThe fourth and fifth translations are the closest to ideal, with the fifth using \"integrate\" and \"further strengthened\" which are slightly more natural. However, the fourth translation is more concise and avoids the slight redundancy in \"the analysis is further strengthened.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nFixed-income portfolios managed by internal personnel of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also incorporate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the analysis is further strengthened.\n\nRegarding ESG investments in the public market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been investing in green, social responsibility, and sustainable bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. In addition, the HKMA participates in the International Finance Corporation's \"Joint Loan Portfolio Management Program,\" with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, coinciding with an increase in market supply, the HKMA increased its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to expand its ESG bond portfolio through direct investments or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will encourage external investment managers to develop ESG-themed equity investment strategies by adopting ESG stock indices as benchmarks for passive investment portfolios. In the coming years, the HKMA will continue to monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as actively managed ESG portfolios and investment tools focused on low-carbon initiatives.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six junior translations are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and cultural appropriateness that affect the overall quality.\nThe first translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous in a global context. It also uses \"designated partners,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"general partners\" or \"fund managers\" in the context of private equity.\nThe second translation uses \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct name of the institution in Hong Kong. It also uses \"general partners,\" which is more accurate in private equity contexts than \"designated partners.\"\nThe third translation correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and uses \"designated partners,\" which is consistent with the original text. It is fluent and accurate, though \"dedicated partners\" in the fourth translation is slightly more natural in English.\nThe fourth translation uses \"dedicated partners,\" which is a slight variation but still acceptable. It also uses \"sound ESG practices,\" which is a minor variation but still accurate.\nThe fifth translation uses \"private equity investments\" instead of \"private market investments,\" which is a more specific term but may not fully capture the broader scope of the original text. It also uses \"ESG operational practices,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nThe sixth translation uses \"fund managers\" instead of \"designated partners,\" which is a more precise term in the context of private equity. It is also fluent and accurate.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use the correct name of the institution (HKMA), use \"fund managers\" or \"general partners\" as appropriate, and maintain a balance between accuracy and fluency. It should also use consistent terminology and ensure that the translation reads naturally in English.\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nIn the area of private market investments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of fund managers during the due diligence process. The HKMA's long-term growth portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and has also incorporated warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features into its real estate investment portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to seek out projects with sustainable characteristics and will consider green certification as an important factor in real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG workshops with fund managers to exchange views and experiences on good ESG practices. At the ESG workshop held in November, the fund managers discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investments. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has requested fund managers to provide ESG-related information on their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately translate key terms such as ESG standards, Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), FCLTGlobal, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main ideas are clearly conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate formal language suitable for an official statement or report.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology and Acronyms:** Some translations use inconsistent or incomplete acronyms (e.g., \"NGFS\" vs. \"Network for Greening the Financial System\"). The full names should be used on first mention, followed by the acronym in parentheses.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"interactive cooperation\" or \"through interactive cooperation,\" which is less natural than \"collaborating with\" or \"engaging with.\"\n- **Grammar and Syntax:** Minor grammatical issues appear in some translations, such as \"the Agency\" instead of \"the HKMA\" or \"the Financial Supervisory Agency\" (which is not the correct name of the organization).\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The use of \"the Financial Supervisory Agency\" is incorrect; the correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and the use of acronyms.\n- Use natural and idiomatic English expressions to enhance fluency.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for an official statement.\n- Correct any grammatical or syntactical errors.\n- Ensure that the name of the organization is consistently translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further integrate these standards into its investment processes, including engaging with like-minded investors and international organizations. As one of the signatories of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the HKMA shoulders the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in developing ESG best practices, promoting other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage long-term-oriented business and investment decisions through workshops and research. The HKMA has also participated in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is a member of the Central Bank and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). In addition, the HKMA organizes seminars and actively participates in events hosted by the investment industry to share and promote the concept of ESG investing.\n\nFor details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's responsible investment policy framework, please refer to the \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" chapter.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2020\n\nSupported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, global financial markets reached record highs by year-end. After experiencing substantial corrections and volatility in the first quarter, global stock markets quickly rebounded, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The S&P 500 in the United States rose by 16%, making it the best-performing of the seven major industrial countries' stock indices in 2020.\n\nIn the bond market, yields on government bonds in major developed countries continued to face downward pressure following a significant decline in the first quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell by approximately 100 basis points, from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% by year-end. Due to a sharp rise in major government bond prices, 2020 saw substantial valuation gains from the bond market.\n\nIn the currency market, declining U.S. interest rates narrowed interest rate differentials, prompting the U.S. dollar to weaken against major currencies. This trend became more pronounced in the second half of 2020, during which the euro and the Chinese yuan appreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2020.\n\nTable 1 2020 Market Returns\nTable 1: 2020 Market Returns\nTable 1: 2020 Market Return\nTable 1 2020 Market Returns\nTable 1 Market Returns in 2020\nTable 1: 2020 Market Returns\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate but vary slightly in punctuation and phrasing. The most common translation is \"Table 1: 2020 Market Returns,\" which appears in translations 1, 2, 6, and is the most standard and widely accepted format for labeling tables in English. However, there are a few notable differences:\n- Translation 3 uses \"Return\" instead of \"Returns,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context, as \"Market Returns\" refers to the plural concept of returns across a market.\n- Translation 4 omits the colon after \"Table 1,\" which is less standard in formal writing, though still understandable.\n- Translation 5 uses \"Market Returns in 2020,\" which is grammatically correct but less concise than the standard format.\nThe best translation should follow the standard format used in formal English documents: \"Table 1: 2020 Market Returns.\" This format is clear, concise, and grammatically correct, making it the most appropriate choice for labeling a table in a professional or academic context.\nTable 1: 2020 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Exchange Fund and its investment income components, including bond investments, stock investments, and valuation adjustments.\n- The use of \"investment income,\" \"investment returns,\" and \"valuation gains\" is consistent with financial terminology.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow, separating the main components of the fund's income and the strategic asset portfolio.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"investment returns\" while others use \"investment income\" or \"investment gains.\" While these terms are related, \"investment income\" is more precise in a financial context.\n- **Clarity of Subsidiary Reference:** The phrase \"investment holding subsidiaries\" or \"investment holdings subsidiaries\" is somewhat ambiguous. A clearer phrasing such as \"subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund’s investment holdings\" would improve clarity.\n- **Use of \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" vs. \"Exchange Fund\":** The original text uses \"外匯基金,\" which is commonly translated as \"Exchange Fund\" in official contexts. Using \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" may be redundant or less standard.\n- **\"Equity\" vs. \"Stock\":** Some translations use \"equity investment,\" which may not be the best term for \"股票投資\" (stock investment). \"Stock investment\" is more direct and commonly used in financial reporting.\n- **Numerical Formatting:** Some translations use \"HKD\" while others use \"HK$\" — both are acceptable, but \"HK$\" is more common in financial contexts in Hong Kong.\n- **\"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" vs. \"Strategic Portfolio\":** The full term \"strategic asset portfolio\" is more precise and consistent with the original text.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently, as it is the standard term.\n- Use \"investment income\" as the primary term for \"投資收入.\"\n- Clarify the relationship between the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries with precise phrasing.\n- Use \"stock investment\" rather than \"equity investment\" for \"股票投資.\"\n- Use \"HK$\" for currency notation.\n- Maintain the full term \"strategic asset portfolio\" for consistency and clarity.\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, which included HK$92.7 billion from bond investments, HK$4 billion from Hong Kong stock investments, HK$69.9 billion from other stock investments, HK$9.6 billion from valuation gains on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HK$59.6 billion from investment income held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund’s investment holdings. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation gains of HK$14 billion.\n"}

The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology, phrasing, and style that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey its external communication strategies and internal governance initiatives.\n- The use of terms like \"institutional governance,\" \"professional capabilities,\" \"information technology security,\" and \"innovative culture\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is clear and follows a logical flow, making the content easy to understand.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect and should be corrected.\n- The phrase \"enhancing public understanding\" is used in all translations, but \"enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations\" is slightly more natural than \"enhancing public understanding of the Commission’s policies and operations.\"\n- The use of \"corporate governance\" in one translation is less precise than \"institutional governance\" in the others, which is more commonly used in regulatory and financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"increasing workloads\" while others use \"increasingly demanding workloads\" or \"increasingly heavy workload.\" The latter is more precise and natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"exercising strict financial control\" is slightly more formal than \"strictly controlling finances,\" which is more commonly used in such contexts.\n- The use of \"thereby enhancing\" in one translation is slightly more formal than necessary and can be simplified to \"enhancing\" for a more direct tone.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct name of the institution is used consistently: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use \"institutional governance\" consistently, as it is the more standard term in this context.\n- Use \"increasingly demanding workloads\" for a more natural and precise expression.\n- Use \"strictly controlling finances\" for a more direct and commonly used phrasing.\n- Simplify the sentence structure where possible to enhance fluency and readability.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains effective communication with the public and the market through traditional and social media, its website, information centers, and other channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, strengthening information technology security, and fostering an innovative culture to address the challenges posed by the implementation of new projects and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n# Stay Connected with the Public\nStay connected with the public.\nStay in touch with the public\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n# Maintain Contact with the Public\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all quite close in meaning, but they vary in terms of fluency, formality, and punctuation. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations use the exact phrase \"Stay Connected with the Public,\" which is a direct and natural translation of the original Chinese. However, the second and fifth versions include the hashtag \"#\", which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context. If this is a title for a section or a heading in a document, the hashtag may be unnecessary unless it's intended for social media or digital content.\nThe third translation, \"Stay connected with the public,\" is grammatically correct but uses lowercase, which may be less formal or appropriate for a heading. The fourth translation, \"Stay in touch with the public,\" is also a valid alternative, though it carries a slightly more casual tone compared to \"Stay Connected with the Public.\"\nThe sixth translation, \"Maintain Contact with the Public,\" is more formal and slightly more bureaucratic in tone, which may be appropriate in certain professional or governmental contexts but may not be as commonly used in general communication.\nConsidering these observations, the most balanced and natural translation would be \"Stay Connected with the Public,\" as it is both accurate and commonly used in English for similar contexts. It maintains the formality of the original Chinese while being natural and fluent in English.\nStay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and grammatical structure that affect the overall quality and readability of each version.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its efforts to maintain transparency and public understanding.\n- The numerical data (93 events, 8 press conferences, etc.) are consistently and accurately translated across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"bilingual press releases\" and \"media inquiries\" is appropriate and consistent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The term \"即場訪問\" is translated inconsistently as \"site visits\" (Translation 1), \"impromptu interviews\" (Translation 2), \"on-site interviews\" (Translations 3, 4, 6), and \"on-site visits\" (Translation 5). \"即場訪問\" more accurately refers to \"on-site interviews\" or \"in-person interviews\" rather than \"site visits,\" which implies a different context.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Translation 5 has a grammatically awkward structure: \"while also daily handling a large number of media inquiries\" disrupts the flow and readability.\n- **Redundancy and Style:** Some translations use redundant phrasing, such as \"in addition to handling\" (Translation 2) or \"on a daily basis\" (Translation 3), which can be simplified for better fluency.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The use of \"physical\" (Translation 1 and 4) versus \"in-person\" (Translations 2, 3, 5) and \"on-site\" (Translations 3, 4, 6) introduces inconsistency. \"In-person\" is more natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"in-person\" consistently for \"實體\" to align with modern English usage.\n- Use \"on-site interviews\" for \"即場訪問\" to reflect the intended meaning.\n- Simplify phrasing for better flow, such as replacing \"on a daily basis\" with \"daily.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and avoid awkward phrasing.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, consistency, and natural English flow while accurately reflecting the original meaning.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, the HKMA organized a total of 93 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 5 on-site interviews, and 80 other public events. It also arranged 14 media interviews, issued 552 bilingual press releases, and handled a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) key functions, the HKMA organizes press briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, as well as influential opinion-makers, covering topics such as the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, green finance, and macroprudential regulatory measures.\n\nMr. Stephen Yü, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".  \nThis translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate title and event name capitalization. However, \"Stephen Yü\" may not be the official English name of the individual, and \"FinTech\" is commonly written as one word in English.\nMr. Stephen Lewis, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020.\"  \nThis translation incorrectly identifies the individual as \"Stephen Lewis\" and uses \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which is the correct title for the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. \"Fintech\" is correctly written as one word.\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue Wai-man presided over an online thematic discussion at Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020.  \nThis translation uses the correct title and name, but \"presided over\" is less common than \"hosted\" or \"chaired\" in this context. \"Thematic discussion\" is slightly awkward compared to \"panel discussion.\"\nMr. Eddie Yue, CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired a special discussion at \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020.\"  \nThis translation uses the correct name and title, but \"CEO\" is not the official title for the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. \"Special discussion\" is vague and less precise than \"panel discussion.\"\nMr. Yoo Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong Financial Technology Week 2020.\"  \nThis translation incorrectly uses \"Yoo\" instead of \"Yü\" and writes \"Financial Technology Week\" as two words, which is less common than the single-word \"FinTech.\"\nMr. Yoo Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the Hong Kong Financial Technology Week 2020.  \nThis translation has the same issues as the previous one, with the incorrect surname and the use of \"Financial Technology Week\" instead of \"FinTech Week.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should use the correct title (\"Governor\"), the correct name (\"Stephen Yü\" or \"Eddie Yue Wai-man\"), and the correct event name (\"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\"). It should also use a natural verb such as \"hosted\" or \"chaired\" to convey the action of leading the discussion.\nMr. Stephen Yü, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".  \nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".  \nMr. Stephen Yü, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".  \nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".  \nAll of these translations are accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in name and verb choice. The most natural and professional translation would be:\nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".\nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020\".\n\nMr. Man Kwok Hang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (center), chaired a media briefing to introduce the HKMA’s two-year plan to promote the application of compliance technology.\n\nMr. Zhou Wenzheng, Director of Fintech at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) use of social media to enhance public understanding and communication, as well as its efforts to combat misinformation during the pandemic. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in terminology, tone, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the key points: the use of social media, the number of platforms, the user count, and the response to the pandemic.\n- The use of terms like \"dispel misinformation\" or \"false rumors\" is appropriate and consistent with the original intent.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology:** The first junior translator refers to the organization as \"The Monetary Authority,\" which is vague and not specific to Hong Kong. The second, fourth, fifth, and sixth translators correctly use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is more precise.\n- **Tense and Verb Choice:** The first and third translators use \"has been using\" and \"has effectively leveraged,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the present tense used in the fourth and sixth translations.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"false rumors\" is used in several translations, which is acceptable, but \"misinformation\" is more commonly used in formal contexts and may be more appropriate.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The fifth translation includes \"enhance understanding of its work across different sectors,\" which is not present in the original and adds unnecessary detail. The sixth translation uses \"December 31, 2020,\" which is more precise than \"the end of December 2020\" used in others.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full and correct name of the organization: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use the present tense for ongoing actions, such as \"uses social media\" and \"operates.\"\n- Use \"misinformation\" instead of \"false rumors\" for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure consistency in date formatting and avoid adding unnecessary details not present in the original.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, ensuring clarity, precision, and cultural appropriateness.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) uses social media to enhance public understanding of its work and strengthen communication with the public. It currently operates five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. As of December 31, 2020, over 66,500 users followed the HKMA’s social media pages. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA effectively used social media to maintain public engagement and dispel misinformation related to the stability of the financial and banking system.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe original text discusses the Public Enquiry Service of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), emphasizing its role in educating the public about the HKMA's functions and the nature of the inquiries it handles in 2020. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in style, terminology, and structure that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message and data from the original text.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent across most translations, with only one using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original's logical flow.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate vocabulary for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"enquiries\" while others use \"inquiries,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"enquiries\" is more commonly used in British English, which may be more appropriate given the context of the HKMA.\n- The term \"coin collection program\" is used in some translations, while others use \"coin collection scheme.\" \"Scheme\" may be more appropriate in the context of government or institutional programs.\n- The phrase \"banking consumer matters\" is used in some translations, while others use \"consumer affairs concerning banks.\" The former is more concise and direct.\n- The use of \"guidelines and notices\" versus \"guidelines and announcements\" is a minor variation, but \"notices\" may be more precise in the context of official communications.\n- Some translations use \"retail bond issuance program\" while others use \"retail bond issuance scheme.\" Again, \"scheme\" may be more appropriate for institutional programs.\n- The phrase \"monetary and economic data\" is used in some translations, while others use \"currency and economic data.\" \"Monetary\" is more precise in the context of financial data.\n**Improvements:**\n- Consistency in terminology, particularly in the use of \"enquiries\" and \"scheme\" where appropriate.\n- Ensuring that the phrasing is concise and aligns with the formal tone of the original text.\n- Maintaining clarity and precision in the description of the types of inquiries handled.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone of the original, use consistent terminology, and ensure clarity and precision in the description of the inquiries handled.\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA's key functions and operations. In 2020, the service handled a total of 9,514 enquiries, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. These included topics such as the coin collection scheme, banking products and services, guidelines and notices related to the banking sector, the retail bond issuance scheme, as well as monetary and economic data.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2017, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of inquiries by category in 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to one another and are largely accurate. However, there are subtle differences in wording that can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation.\n\"Queries\" and \"Inquiries\" are both acceptable translations of \"查詢\" in this context, though \"Inquiries\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official or statistical contexts, which seems appropriate for a figure in a report or document. \"Queries\" is more commonly used in technical or digital contexts, such as \"search queries\" or \"database queries.\"\nThe phrase \"Total Number of Public Inquiries\" is more natural and commonly used in formal English than \"Total Number of Public Queries,\" especially in the context of a figure caption. The use of \"Number of\" is slightly redundant when paired with \"Total,\" but it is not incorrect. However, \"Total Public Inquiries\" is more concise and still clear, though it may be slightly less formal.\nAmong the translations, the most natural and appropriate would be \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" or \"Figure 1: Total Public Inquiries.\" The former is more formal and precise, while the latter is more concise. Given the context of a figure caption, the more concise version is preferable, as captions should be brief and to the point.\nTherefore, the best translation would be: \"Figure 1: Total Public Inquiries.\"\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2020, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report during the year. It also regularly updated the Monthly Financial Data Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. Furthermore, the HKMA published 18 articles in the \"Insight\" series, introducing the HKMA's key measures and policies and discussing issues of public concern.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward news statement about an award received by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2019 Annual Report. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, terminology, and grammatical structure that affect fluency and accuracy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the award recipient (the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2019 Annual Report), the award (Silver Award), the category (\"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\"), and the event (Best Annual Report Awards).\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology, such as \"Silver Award\" and \"Annual Report.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Management\" but the original Chinese refers to \"香港管理專業協會,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Hong Kong Institute of Management Professionals\" or \"Hong Kong Management Association.\" The term \"Institute of Management\" may be misleading.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Hong Kong Management Association,\" which is closer to the original, but the phrase \"Best Annual Report Awards\" is slightly redundant, as \"Best Annual Report Awards\" is already implied in the context.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"Annual Best Annual Report Selection,\" which is awkward and redundant. \"Selection\" is not the standard term used for such awards.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Organisations\" with an's' instead of 'izations,' which is a minor but noticeable spelling error.\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the original, but it uses \"Institute of Management\" again, which may not be the most accurate term for the organization.\n- **Translation 6** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"Selection\" instead of \"Awards,\" which is less standard for this type of event.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the correct name for the organization: \"Hong Kong Institute of Management Professionals\" or \"Hong Kong Management Association.\"\n- Use \"Awards\" rather than \"Selection\" to align with standard terminology for such events.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" with the correct spelling of \"Organizations.\"\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"Annual Best Annual Report Awards.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2019 Annual Report won a Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2020 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision that affect the quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its official website.\n- They all mention the availability of over 40,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n- Most translations accurately reference the legal provisions (Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance and the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance) under which the registers are maintained.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the translation of terms such as “認可機構” (Recognized Institutions), which is translated as “Recognized Institutions,” “Authorized Institutions,” or “Authorized Institutions.” The term “Recognized Institutions” is more commonly used in official HKMA documents and legal texts, so it should be standardized.\n- **Register Titles:** The titles of the registers differ slightly across translations. For example, “認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊” is translated as “Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representatives,” “Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representatives’ Offices,” or “Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices.” The most accurate and consistent translation would be “Register of Recognized Institutions and Their Local Representative Offices.”\n- **“儲值支付工具” vs. “儲值設施”:** Some translations use “Stored Value Payment Instruments,” while others use “Stored Value Facilities.” The correct term in legal and regulatory contexts is “Stored Value Payment Instruments.”\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use phrases like “making it convenient for the public” or “facilitating public access,” which are acceptable but could be more concise and natural. For example, “enabling the public to access” is more direct and commonly used in official contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Standardize the use of “Recognized Institutions” for consistency with official terminology.\n- Ensure the titles of the registers are consistent and accurately reflect the original Chinese.\n- Use precise and commonly accepted legal terminology, such as “Stored Value Payment Instruments” instead of “Stored Value Facilities.”\n- Improve fluency by using more concise and natural phrasing, such as “enabling the public to access” instead of “making it convenient for the public to access.”\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that is precise, consistent with official terminology, and fluent in natural English.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 40,000 pages of information in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese, enabling the public to access the latest information from the HKMA. The website also contains the “Register of Recognized Institutions and Their Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Recognized Institutions’ Securities Business Staff,” maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Instruments,” maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments Ordinance.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative to release financial data and important information through open APIs since 2018, with a total of 144 APIs launched by the end of 2020. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas for improvement in terms of fluency, precision, and consistency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the timeline (since 2018) and the number of APIs (144).\n- The use of \"open application programming interfaces (open APIs)\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate for clarity.\n- The phrase \"as scheduled\" is used effectively to indicate that the launch of APIs was completed on time.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n- **Inconsistent Terminology:** The sixth translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error.\n- **Word Choice:** The use of \"progressively\" or \"gradually\" is acceptable, but \"in phases\" may be more precise in reflecting the original Chinese term \"分階段發放.\"\n- **Verb Tense and Clarity:** The phrase \"had launched a total of 144 open APIs on its website as scheduled\" is grammatically correct but could be more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently after the first mention to avoid repetition.\n- Replace \"progressively\" or \"gradually\" with \"in phases\" to better align with the original Chinese term.\n- Ensure the correct name of the organization is used throughout the translation.\n- Simplify the sentence structure to enhance fluency and readability.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be concise, accurate, and fluent, using appropriate terminology and maintaining the original meaning and nuance.\n\nThe original sentence, \"金管局積極支持開放API的發展及應用,\" refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its active support for the development and application of open APIs. The junior translators have provided several versions of this sentence, with varying levels of accuracy and fluency.\nThe first junior translator uses \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the organization in question. This is a clear error in terminology and could mislead readers.\nThe second and third translators use \"HKMA\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" respectively. Both are accurate, but \"HKMA\" is an abbreviation that may not be familiar to all readers, while the full name is more precise and professional in formal contexts.\nThe fourth translation is identical to the third, so it presents the same strengths and weaknesses.\nThe fifth junior translator uses \"Financial Authority,\" which is also incorrect and lacks specificity. This is another example of a terminology error.\nThe sixth junior translator uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and changes \"application\" to \"adoption,\" which is a slight but meaningful shift in meaning. \"Adoption\" implies a more deliberate and formal process of taking up something new, which may be more appropriate in this context than \"application,\" which can be more general or technical.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and professionalism, and use \"adoption\" instead of \"application\" to better reflect the intentional and strategic nature of supporting open APIs.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation of the original sentence is:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively supports the development and adoption of open APIs.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core information of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre as being on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2.\n- They all accurately describe the two main sections of the Centre: the exhibition hall and the library.\n- The translations correctly mention the number of books and publications in the library (over 26,000) and the legal requirement under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology such as \"interactive displays,\" \"reference materials,\" and \"maintains the register.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the use of terms such as \"HKMA,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Authority,\" and \"Monetary Authority Information Centre.\" Some translations use \"HKMA\" consistently, while others use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Authority\" without clarification.\n- **Building Name:** The building is referred to as \"International Finance Centre Phase 2\" in most translations, but one translation uses \"Two International Finance Centre\" and another uses \"International Finance Centre Tower 2.\" The correct and most commonly used term is \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\n- **Register Titles:** There is variation in the titles of the registers, such as \"Register of Licensed Institutions and Local Representatives,\" \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representatives,\" and \"Register of Approved Institutions and Local Representatives’ Offices.\" The correct title is \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" as per the Banking Ordinance.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use more formal and precise language, while others are slightly more colloquial. For example, \"introduces the public to the work of the HKMA\" is more natural than \"introducing the public to the work of the Authority.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently and clarify it as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n- Use the correct and standard name for the building: \"International Finance Centre Phase 2.\"\n- Ensure the titles of the registers are accurate and consistent with the Banking Ordinance.\n- Use precise and formal language to maintain the professional tone of the original text.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, ensuring consistency in terminology, correct building name, and accurate register titles.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It introduces the public to the work of the HKMA and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sectors through interactive displays, and also provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is the library, which houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics related to Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Recognized Institutions,\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe original text mentions the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre (金管局資訊中心) winning a Platinum Award in the Interior Design category of the 2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS. It emphasizes the centre's \"精心設計及獨樹一格的氛圍\" (meticulously designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere) as the reason for its success among over a thousand participants.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Technology Research Institute\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre.\" The term \"meticulously designed space\" is slightly vague compared to the original's \"精心設計及獨樹一格的氛圍.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre. The phrase \"carefully crafted design and unique atmosphere\" is accurate, though \"distinguished from over a thousand entrants\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Incorrectly names the entity as \"Goldman Sachs Information Center,\" which is a major error. The rest of the translation is fluent, but the misidentification undermines the accuracy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the entity and uses \"thoughtfully designed and distinctive atmosphere,\" which is a natural and accurate rendering. The structure is clear and fluent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the entity and uses \"meticulously designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere,\" which is a strong and accurate translation. However, \"uniquely distinctive\" is slightly redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the entity and uses \"meticulously designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere.\" The phrase \"becoming one of the winners of the Platinum Award\" is slightly wordy compared to \"winning one of the Platinum Awards.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre.\n- Use natural, fluent English.\n- Avoid redundancy (e.g., \"uniquely distinctive\").\n- Correctly reflect the award category and the reason for the win.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre stood out among over a thousand participants from around the world, winning one of the Platinum Awards in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS\" for its meticulously designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness that can be refined for a more polished and professional translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Information Centre\" and the year \"2020\" as the context for the temporary closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n- The phrase \"in response to visitor feedback\" is consistently used, which accurately reflects the original intent.\n- The term \"interactive facilities\" is well translated and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the name of the organization. Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau.\" The original text refers to \"金管局,\" which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), so using \"HKMA\" with the full name in parentheses is more precise.\n- **Use of \"Optimize\" vs. \"Upgrade\/Enhance\":** While \"optimize\" is a valid term, \"upgrade\" or \"enhance\" may be more natural in this context, as it refers to improving facilities rather than optimizing a system.\n- **\"Policies\" vs. \"Policy\":** The original text uses \"政策\" (policy), which is singular. Some translations use \"Policies\" (plural), which may be a minor but unnecessary deviation.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"capitalized on the opportunity\" or \"made good use of the opportunity,\" which are slightly more formal and may be less natural than \"took advantage of the opportunity.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations include \"thereby enhancing the overall visitor experience\" which is slightly redundant, as the previous clause already implies the result.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n- Use \"enhance\" or \"upgrade\" instead of \"optimize\" for a more natural tone.\n- Maintain the singular \"Policy\" as in the original.\n- Use \"took advantage of the opportunity\" for a more natural and concise expression.\n- Avoid redundancy by ensuring that the result of the improvements is clearly implied without repetition.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Information Centre took advantage of the opportunity presented by the temporary closure in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance the facilities in the \"Policy\" exhibition area. This area explains the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and introduces related financial concepts. The improvements were made in response to visitor feedback, making the interactive facilities more user-friendly, engaging, and durable, and enhancing the overall visitor experience.\n\nThe original sentence, \"資訊中心「政策」展區的互動設施完成優化工程。\" translates to something like \"The interactive facilities in the 'Policy' exhibition area of the Information Center have completed the optimization project.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of this sentence, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning, but the phrase \"have completed the optimization project\" is slightly awkward in English, as it implies the facilities themselves completed the project, which is not the intended meaning.\nTranslation 2 is concise and natural, using \"upgraded\" instead of \"completed the optimization project.\" This is a more idiomatic expression in English and better reflects the intended meaning that the facilities have been improved or enhanced.\nTranslation 3 is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"their\" before \"optimization project.\" This adds a slight nuance but is still not the most natural phrasing in English.\nTranslation 4 and 5 both use the phrase \"have been completed with optimization,\" which is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear. It suggests that the facilities were completed using optimization, which is not the intended meaning.\nTranslation 6 is similar to Translation 1 and 3, with the same issue of implying that the facilities themselves completed the project.\nConsidering these observations, the best approach would be to use a more natural and idiomatic expression in English. Instead of saying the facilities \"have completed the optimization project,\" it would be more accurate to say that the facilities \"have been optimized\" or \"have undergone optimization.\" This better reflects the passive nature of the action, where the facilities are the recipients of the optimization, not the ones performing it.\nAdditionally, the term \"interactive facilities\" is slightly more technical than \"interactive exhibits,\" which may be more appropriate in the context of an exhibition area. However, both are acceptable depending on the specific context.\nTaking all of these considerations into account, the best possible translation would be:\n\"The interactive exhibits in the 'Policy' exhibition area of the Information Center have been optimized.\"\nThis translation is concise, natural, and accurately conveys the intended meaning that the interactive exhibits have undergone an optimization process.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the exhibition area within the Information Centre provides an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) functions and the evolution of Hong Kong's currency and banking industry.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"banking and financial industry\" instead of \"currency and banking industry.\" While not incorrect, it slightly diverges from the original, which specifically mentions \"currency\" and \"banking.\" The term \"financial industry\" is broader and less precise in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"currency and banking industry,\" aligning with the original. However, \"exhibition section\" is slightly less common than \"exhibition hall\" in describing such spaces, though still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"exhibition hall section,\" which is redundant and awkward. \"Exhibition hall\" alone is sufficient, and adding \"section\" is unnecessary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Identical to the third, with the same redundancy issue.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"currency and banking sector\" instead of \"industry.\" While \"sector\" is acceptable, \"industry\" is more commonly used in this context when referring to the broader economic field.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"currency and banking industry\" and \"exhibition section,\" which is acceptable though slightly less common than \"exhibition hall.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be both accurate and natural in English. \"Exhibition hall\" is more commonly used than \"exhibition section\" when referring to a physical space within a building. \"Currency and banking industry\" is more precise than \"financial industry\" or \"sector\" in this context. The term \"Information Centre\" should be kept as is, as it is a proper noun referring to a specific location.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe exhibition hall of the Information Centre introduces the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking industry.\n\nTo ensure that all members of the public, regardless of ethnicity, can equally access the facilities of the information center, the center has established procedures to provide interpretation services for visitors who need them and for individuals who call the center's hotline for inquiries.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and stylistic consistency that can be refined for a more polished and professional result.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly capture the main points: the impact of the pandemic on the Information Center's operations, the implementation of special arrangements and preventive measures, and the use of long-lasting disinfectant coatings.\n- The use of terms like \"preventive measures,\" \"enhanced cleaning and disinfection,\" and \"long-lasting antibacterial coatings\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- Most translations use \"Information Center\" with proper capitalization, which is suitable for formal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Syntax:** The fourth translation uses \"enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and regularly disinfected facilities...\" which is grammatically awkward due to the missing subject and verb in the second part. The second and fifth translations use \"has implemented... enhanced cleaning and disinfection,\" which is also grammatically incorrect as \"enhanced cleaning and disinfection\" is not a verb phrase.\n- **Tense and Time Reference:** The first and fifth translations use \"will implement\" and \"throughout the year,\" which may be inconsistent with the original text's reference to \"year內\" (this year). The third and sixth translations use \"this year,\" which is more precise.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"antimicrobial,\" others \"antibacterial,\" and one uses \"bactericidal.\" While these terms are related, \"antimicrobial\" is more inclusive and commonly used in public health contexts.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The sixth translation is the most fluent, with a natural flow and clear structure. It also uses \"the Centre\" for brevity, which is acceptable in formal writing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"antimicrobial\" instead of \"antibacterial\" or \"bactericidal.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness by using appropriate verb forms and subject-verb agreement.\n- Clarify the time reference to \"this year\" for accuracy.\n- Maintain a formal yet fluent tone suitable for official announcements or public notices.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe opening hours and services of the Information Centre have been affected due to the ongoing pandemic. To ensure public safety and maintain a high standard of hygiene, the Centre has implemented special opening arrangements and preventative measures this year, including enhanced cleaning and disinfection. Facilities and exhibits are also regularly disinfected using long-lasting antimicrobial coatings.\n\n# Public and Consumer Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA held an online public education seminar in 2020, attracting over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's operations, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, safeguarding personal digital keys, and the deposit protection scheme. This was the first time the education seminar, which was launched in 1998, was held online, and to date, more than 61,000 students and teachers have participated.\n\nMore than 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's online public education seminar.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to educate the public on being responsible financial consumers, with a focus on protecting personal digital keys and being cautious of online scams during the pandemic. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and grammatical precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the main message.\n- The term \"Protecting Personal Digital Keys\" is consistently translated, though some variations in capitalization exist.\n- The mention of the increase in online scams during the pandemic is well captured in all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"remain vigilant,\" \"be cautious of scams,\" and \"guard against fraudulent schemes\" is appropriate and consistent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"at all times and places\" (e.g., Translation 1), which is redundant and unnatural in English. A more natural expression would be \"at all times and in all situations\" or simply \"at all times.\"\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** The term \"digital keys\" is used in all translations, but \"digital keys\" is not a standard term in English for this context. A more natural and commonly used term would be \"digital credentials\" or \"online account access.\"\n- **Tense and Voice:** Some translations use the present continuous tense (\"is educating,\" \"is committed to\") which may not be the most natural choice for a general statement about ongoing efforts. The simple present tense is often more appropriate for such contexts.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"personal authentication information\" is technically correct but somewhat formal and less commonly used in public-facing communications. \"Personal identification information\" or \"personal verification details\" may be more natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural and commonly used terms such as \"digital credentials\" or \"online account access\" instead of \"digital keys.\"\n- Replace \"at all times and places\" with \"at all times\" or \"at all times and in all situations.\"\n- Use the simple present tense for general statements about ongoing efforts.\n- Replace \"personal authentication information\" with \"personal identification information\" or \"personal verification details\" for better fluency and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers and maintains ongoing communication with the public on this matter. A key focus of this educational work continues to be \"Safeguarding Your Digital Credentials.\" This year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos urging citizens to properly protect their financial accounts and personal information at all times. Given the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA reminds the public to remain vigilant when shopping online or using personal identification information and to guard against fraudulent schemes.\n\nTo increase young people's interest in joining the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the HKMA launched a public education web series titled \"STEPS\" in 2020 and posted a series of related posts on social media, introducing the HKMA's work in areas such as currency, the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, financial inclusion, banking supervision, and international cooperation.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, highlighting the purpose of the web series \"STEPS\" as a public education tool that uses a light-hearted narrative to explain the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) functions through the story of a young person's professional development.\n**Review of the translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and clear, but \"light-hearted approach\" is slightly less vivid than \"lighthearted\" or \"relaxed and engaging.\" The structure is slightly awkward: \"through the story of a young person's growth in their new job.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is fluent and natural, with \"relaxed and engaging approach\" adding a nice touch of tone. However, \"newly hired young person\" is slightly wordy compared to \"young newcomer\" or \"new employee.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"web drama\" is slightly off, as \"web series\" is more commonly used for episodic content. \"Lighthearted\" is a good choice, and \"young, newly employed individual\" is clear but slightly formal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version, with \"lighthearted approach\" and \"young person starting a new job\" being natural and clear. The structure is smooth and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Young newcomer\" is a good, concise term. However, \"web drama\" may not be the best term for a web series, and the sentence structure is slightly less fluid than some alternatives.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version, with \"light-hearted approach\" and \"new employee\" being clear and natural. The structure is smooth and accurate.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\nThe best version should use \"web series\" rather than \"web drama\" to align with common terminology. \"Lighthearted\" is more natural than \"light-hearted\" in this context. \"Young newcomer\" or \"new employee\" are both good, but \"young newcomer\" adds a slightly more engaging tone. The sentence structure should be smooth and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved translation:**\nThe public education web series *STEPS* uses a lighthearted approach to introduce the main functions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority through the growth story of a young newcomer.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在數碼平台及戶外媒體廣泛宣傳保護個人數碼鎖匙的訊息。**\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been widely promoting messages about protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), correct use of \"digital platforms\" and \"outdoor media,\" and the verb tense (\"has been promoting\") reflects ongoing action.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Messages\" is slightly vague; \"information\" might be more precise. \"Outdoor media\" is correct, but \"outdoor\" is less commonly used than \"outdoor media\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority widely promotes messages about protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as above, but uses the simple present tense, which is acceptable for general statements.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above; \"messages\" is vague, and \"outdoor media\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Services and Markets Authority has been widely promoting messages about protecting personal digital keys across digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"across\" instead of \"through,\" which is slightly more natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is the correct name in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has widely publicized information on protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and overseas media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" (a common abbreviation), and \"publicized\" is a strong verb.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Overseas media\" is incorrect; the original refers to \"戶外媒體,\" which means \"outdoor media,\" not \"overseas.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority has widely promoted messages on protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and overseas media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" (though it should be \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\").  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Overseas media\" is incorrect, and the name is incomplete.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority widely promotes information on protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct name, correct use of \"information\" and \"outdoor media.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses the simple present tense, which is acceptable, but \"promotes\" is slightly less dynamic than \"has been promoting.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full and correct name: **\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"** (not \"HKMA\" or \"Monetary Authority\").\n- Use **\"information\"** instead of \"messages\" for clarity and precision.\n- Use **\"outdoor media\"** as the correct translation of \"戶外媒體.\"\n- Use a **present perfect continuous tense** (\"has been promoting\") to reflect an ongoing action.\n- Use **\"through\"** or **\"across\"** to indicate the channels of promotion.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been widely promoting information on protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe original text describes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts in promoting financial literacy among young children through a community engagement program called \"Little Financial Experts.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terminology such as \"financial literacy program\" and \"community engagement activities.\" However, it uses \"Financial Managers\" instead of \"Financial Experts,\" which may not align with the original Chinese term.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version correctly identifies the HKMA as the subject and uses \"Financial Experts\" for the program name. However, it incorrectly refers to the authority as the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" which is not the correct name for the HKMA.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the correct name for the authority. It also uses \"Financial Managers\" instead of \"Financial Experts,\" which may not be the most appropriate term based on the original Chinese.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is fluent and accurate, using \"Financial Experts\" and \"homemade toys\" instead of \"DIY toys.\" However, it uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be less precise.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"Financial Experts\" and \"HKMA\" correctly. It is fluent and well-structured, making it one of the stronger translations.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is the most comprehensive and accurate. It correctly identifies the HKMA, uses \"Financial Experts\" for the program name, and provides a clear and natural flow. It also uses \"utilizes\" instead of \"teaches through,\" which adds a more formal tone appropriate for the context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original Chinese text, use the correct name for the authority (HKMA), and use the most appropriate term for the program name (\"Little Financial Experts\"). It should also maintain a formal and professional tone while ensuring clarity and fluency. The sixth translation is the closest to meeting these criteria, but it can be slightly refined for greater clarity and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with various stakeholders through a range of community engagement activities. One such initiative is the online parent-child financial education program, \"Little Financial Experts.\" This program utilizes animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and coloring contests to teach kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts about money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge regarding banking and payment services.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and straightforward: \"以Dollar豬和金氏一家為主角的動畫影片，就五個主題發放訊息。\" The key elements are the animated film, the main characters (Dollar Pig and the Kim family), and the action of conveying messages on five themes.\nAll six translations capture the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision. \nThe first and second translations are identical and use \"conveys messages on five themes.\" This is grammatically correct and fluent, but \"conveys messages on\" is slightly formal and may not be the most natural phrasing in modern English.\nThe third translation uses \"animated video\" instead of \"animated film.\" While \"video\" is technically correct, \"film\" is more commonly used in the context of animated productions, especially when referring to a full-length production.\nThe fourth translation mirrors the first and second, with the only difference being the placement of the comma, which does not significantly affect the meaning or fluency.\nThe fifth translation uses \"Jin family\" instead of \"Kim family.\" This is a potential error, as the original text uses \"金氏一家,\" which is more accurately translated as \"Kim family\" (assuming \"Kim\" is the correct transliteration of the surname). \"Jin\" could be a different surname or a transliteration error.\nThe sixth translation uses \"delivers messages on five different themes.\" The addition of \"different\" is not present in the original and may be an unnecessary embellishment. However, \"delivers\" is a more active and natural verb than \"conveys\" in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would retain the natural phrasing of \"animated film,\" use \"Kim family\" as the correct transliteration, and use a more active verb such as \"delivers\" or \"spreads\" to convey the action of the film. Additionally, \"on five themes\" is acceptable, but \"across five themes\" may offer a slightly more natural and idiomatic expression.\nImproved Translation:\nThe animated film featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family spreads messages across five themes.\n\nDemonstrate how to make toys using eco-friendly materials.\nThe original Chinese phrase \"示範以環保物料自製玩具\" translates to \"Demonstrate making homemade toys with eco-friendly materials.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of this translation, with slight differences in phrasing and word choice.\nThe first, third, fifth, and sixth translations all use the phrase \"using eco-friendly materials,\" which is accurate and natural in English. The second translation uses \"from environmentally friendly materials,\" which is also correct but slightly less common than \"using.\" The fourth translation includes \"homemade,\" which is a good addition as it captures the meaning of \"自製\" (self-made or homemade), but it is not present in the original phrase.\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be \"Demonstrate how to make toys using eco-friendly materials.\" This version captures the full meaning of the original phrase, including the action of making toys, the use of eco-friendly materials, and the instructional nature of the demonstration. It is also the most concise and fluent among the translations provided.\n\nOther work related to youth education includes an online financial literacy quiz competition, online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, a collaboration with a professional organization to produce a comic book for primary school students and their parents, as well as online seminars for university students.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) support for the Investor and Financial Education Council (IFEC) in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong residents. It also mentions the HKMA's intention to study further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Investor and Financial Education Council\" correctly and \"community engagement\" is appropriate. However, \"study further collaboration\" is slightly less natural than \"explore further collaboration.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Investors and Financial Education Committee\" is slightly off; the original refers to a \"Council,\" not a \"Committee.\" Also, \"community participation\" is less precise than \"community engagement.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The term \"Investor Education Council\" omits \"Financial,\" which is part of the official name. Also, \"capability\" is singular, whereas the original uses \"capabilities,\" which is more accurate. \"Citizens\" is slightly less common than \"residents\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original. It correctly uses \"Investor and Financial Education Council,\" \"residents,\" and \"community engagement.\" However, \"capability\" is singular, which is less precise than the plural \"capabilities.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"Investor and Financial Education Council,\" \"capabilities,\" and \"community engagement.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"study\" instead of \"explore,\" which is slightly less natural in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Investors and Financial Education Committee\" incorrectly (should be \"Council\"), and \"study\" is slightly less natural than \"explore.\" However, the rest of the translation is strong.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct official name of the organization (\"Investor and Financial Education Council\"), use the plural form \"capabilities\" to match the original, and use \"explore\" instead of \"study\" for a more natural tone. It should also use \"residents\" rather than \"citizens\" for consistency with the original and \"community engagement\" for accuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong residents, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff\nThe original text is \"# 金管局員工,\" where \"金管局\" refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and \"員工\" means \"staff\" or \"employees.\" The translations provided by the junior translators mostly capture the core meaning, but there are notable differences in accuracy and appropriateness.\nTranslation 1 and 3 are accurate and concise, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff,\" which is the most direct and appropriate translation. It maintains the official title and uses \"staff,\" which is commonly used in formal contexts to refer to employees of an organization.\nTranslation 2 is nearly identical to Translation 1, except it retains the \"#\" symbol from the original text. While this may be appropriate in certain formatting contexts (e.g., headings in a document), it is unnecessary in a standalone translation and may be considered stylistically inconsistent with standard English usage.\nTranslation 4 is incorrect, as \"Financial Services and Technology Bureau\" is not the official name of the organization referred to by \"金管局.\" This is a different entity, and using this translation would lead to confusion or misinformation.\nTranslation 5 uses \"Employees\" instead of \"Staff.\" While both terms are correct, \"staff\" is more commonly used in formal or official contexts, making it a more appropriate choice here.\nTranslation 6 is also incorrect, as \"Financial Authority\" is not the official name of the organization. Additionally, the use of \"Employees\" is less formal than \"Staff,\" which may not be ideal for an official title.\nIn conclusion, the best translation is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff,\" as it is accurate, concise, and stylistically appropriate for an official title. It avoids unnecessary symbols and uses the most suitable terminology for the context.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as a government entity that employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract qualified professionals and maintain a competent workforce to achieve policy goals and adapt to changing demands.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"non-civil service terms\" correctly and maintains a professional tone. However, \"highly professional and competent\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" is incorrect; the correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and well-structured. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and includes the parenthetical abbreviation. The phrase \"flexibly respond to changing work demands\" is natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very strong. It uses \"high-caliber\" and \"evolving work requirements,\" which are more sophisticated and natural than some of the other translations. The structure is clear and professional.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** The use of \"Monetary Authority\" without \"Hong Kong\" is imprecise. The phrase \"high-quality workforce\" is slightly less formal than \"high-caliber\" or \"highly capable.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"terms and conditions that are not those of civil servants,\" which is more detailed than \"non-civil service terms.\" However, \"changing job requirements\" is slightly less natural than \"changing work demands\" or \"evolving work requirements.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use natural, professional language. It should correctly identify the HKMA, use appropriate terminology, and maintain a consistent tone. The fourth junior translator's version is the strongest, with natural phrasing and appropriate vocabulary. However, it can be slightly refined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the government structure but hires its staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized expertise. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and high-caliber workforce to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to evolving work requirements.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) staffing levels and resource management strategies in 2020 and 2021. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate and fluent, but there are variations in terminology, structure, and tone.\nStrengths across the translations include accurate numerical data, correct use of terms like \"staffing level\" or \"staff strength,\" and a clear structure that mirrors the original. All translations convey the core message that the HKMA maintained the same staffing level in 2021 while reallocating resources to meet new and expanded work areas.\nHowever, there are notable differences in terminology. For instance, \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" in the first translation is incorrect; the correct entity is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The use of \"manpower strength\" or \"staff complement\" is less common in formal English compared to \"staffing level\" or \"staff strength.\" Additionally, some translations use \"newly initiated and expanded work areas\" or \"tasks,\" which are slightly less precise than \"newly launched and expanded projects\" or \"work areas.\"\nThe sentence structure in some translations is slightly awkward, such as \"The Authority aimed to meet the needs of new projects and increasingly demanding work by flexibly allocating...\" which could be more concise. Also, the phrase \"through the flexible allocation of existing resources\" in one translation is slightly redundant compared to \"by flexibly allocating existing resources.\"\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements can be made:\n- Use the correct name of the organization: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use consistent and commonly accepted terminology such as \"staffing level\" or \"staff strength.\"\n- Ensure clarity and conciseness in sentence structure.\n- Use precise terms like \"projects\" or \"work areas\" rather than \"tasks\" or \"initiatives\" when referring to the work being undertaken.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had a staffing level of 1,005 in 2020. During the year, the HKMA focused on meeting the needs of new projects and increasing workloads by flexibly allocating existing resources, improving efficiency, and streamlining work procedures. The HKMA’s staffing level will remain at 1,005 in 2021, and existing resources will be reallocated to address the following newly launched and expanded work areas:\n\n# Stability of the Banking and Financial System  \n- Support the policy development of Wealth Management Connect, as well as other measures related to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and private wealth management, and ongoing supervision of Wealth Management Connect operations  \n- Handle licensing activities under the Insurance Ordinance and the new over-the-counter derivatives regime, as well as conduct regulatory oversight related to virtual banks  \n- Implement new regulatory requirements concerning climate risk, and enhance prudential supervision of banks\n\n# Reserve Management  \n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to align with the Exchange Fund's continued expansion and diversification of investment operations.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center  \n- To provide support for participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups  \n- To administer the recently proposed carried interest tax concession regime and verify the eligibility of funds for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by department.\n\nTable 1: Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Establishment and Actual Number of Staff as of January 1, 2021\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe original text outlines the process by which the Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff, referencing the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, market practices, and the structure of the compensation package. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity.\n**Translation 1** is clear and accurate, but uses \"seeks the views of\" which is slightly indirect. It also uses \"service conditions\" which is acceptable but less common than \"employment conditions\" or \"terms of employment.\"\n**Translation 2** is fluent and uses \"receives input from its subordinate governance committees,\" which is more precise than \"seeks the views of.\" It also uses \"mandatory provident fund contributions,\" which is more accurate than \"provident fund\" alone. The term \"variable pay component\" is more natural than \"performance-based lump-sum payment.\"\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"has consulted\" and \"has determined,\" which are passive and less direct. It also uses \"mandatory provident fund contributions,\" which is accurate, but \"a range of basic benefits\" is slightly vague.\n**Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Chief of the Financial Services Department\" instead of the \"Financial Secretary.\" It also uses \"fixed monthly component\" and \"variable component,\" which are acceptable but less precise than \"fixed monthly salary\" and \"performance-based annual bonus.\"\n**Translation 5** also misidentifies the role as \"Chief of the Financial Services Department\" and uses \"pension fund\" instead of \"provident fund,\" which is incorrect in the context of Hong Kong. It also uses \"base salary\" instead of \"basic salary,\" which is a minor but notable difference in terminology.\n**Translation 6** is accurate in identifying the \"Financial Secretary\" and uses \"remuneration\" and \"employment conditions,\" which are more formal and appropriate for official documents. It also uses \"performance-based annual bonus,\" which is clear and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the role of the Financial Secretary, use appropriate terminology such as \"provident fund\" and \"basic salary,\" and maintain a formal yet fluent tone. It should also avoid passive constructions and ensure clarity in describing the compensation structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and employment conditions of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff by consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the views of its governing committees and by referring to market salary levels and practices. The remuneration package includes cash compensation and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a monthly fixed salary (i.e., basic salary) and a performance-based annual bonus.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to formal English conventions. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, the phrase “they seek advice from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Governance Committee through the Exchange Fund Advisory Council” is slightly awkward. It implies that the Financial Secretary seeks advice from the Governance Committee via the Exchange Fund Advisory Council, which may not be the clearest way to express the hierarchical relationship.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version uses “Chief of the Financial Services Department,” which is incorrect. The correct title is “Financial Secretary.” Also, the phrase “the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee seeks the recommendations of its Governance Committee” is misleading, as the Governance Committee is not a subcommittee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses “seeking recommendations from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which in turn considers...” to clearly convey the chain of consultation. The use of “compensation survey” is slightly less common than “salary survey,” but it is still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the ideal. It uses “consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain advice from its governance committee,” which is a clear and accurate reflection of the original. The use of “remuneration” is more formal and appropriate in this context. However, “its competitiveness” at the end is slightly awkward; “their competitive compensation” would be more natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses “take into account” and “to serve as rewards,” which are natural expressions. However, the phrase “they seek advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee” is slightly vague in terms of the process, as it doesn’t clearly indicate that the Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Council to get the Governance Committee’s input.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and well-structured. It correctly uses “Financial Secretary” and clearly explains the process of consultation. The phrase “the recommendations of the HKMA's Governance Committee are considered through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee” is slightly wordy but still clear.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should clearly reflect the hierarchical process of consultation, use formal and precise terminology, and maintain a natural, fluent tone. It should also avoid redundancy and ensure that the relationship between the Financial Secretary, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the Governance Committee is clearly conveyed.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain the recommendations of the HKMA’s Governance Committee. This review takes into account the Governance Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a remuneration survey for the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments as a reward and to maintain their competitive compensation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to formal English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately convey the mechanism of allocating funds based on individual performance.\n- The concept of linking investment performance to variable compensation is consistently translated.\n- The hierarchical structure of employee levels (e.g., Assistant General Manager, Deputy Chief Executive, Director, etc.) is generally well-represented, though there is some variation in terminology.\n- The process of approval by the Financial Secretary and the role of the Governance Committee are accurately reflected in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the titles used for different employee levels (e.g., \"Assistant General Manager,\" \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" \"Director,\" \"Assistant Director,\" \"Manager,\" \"Supervisor\"). The original Chinese uses \"助理總裁及以上職級\" and \"主管及以下職級,\" which should be translated consistently as \"Assistant Chief Executive and above\" and \"Director and below\" respectively.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the entire approved fund allocated for salary payments\" or \"the approved lump sum for salary payments,\" which can be more naturally phrased as \"the approved lump sum designated for salary payments.\"\n- **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness:** The term \"Governance Committee\" is used in some translations, but the original Chinese does not specify the exact name of the committee. It may be more appropriate to use \"Governance Committee\" as a general term unless a specific name is known.\n- **Passive vs. Active Voice:** Some translations use overly passive constructions, which can make the text feel less direct and less formal than required for official documentation.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use consistent and accurate titles for employee levels based on the original Chinese.\n- Ensure that the language is formal, fluent, and grammatically correct, avoiding awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain the hierarchical structure and the procedural clarity of the original text.\n- Use precise terms such as \"lump sum designated for salary payments\" instead of \"entire approved fund\" or \"approved lump sum for salary payments.\"\n- Ensure that the role of the Financial Secretary and the Governance Committee is clearly and consistently described.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual employees' performance. The variable compensation system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and their compensation. Adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation for Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee, with these employees recusing themselves from meetings where their compensation is discussed. For employees at the level of Director and below, adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive, under the authority of the Financial Secretary, based on the lump sum designated for salary payments.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","en":"# Institutional Social Responsibility\n\nThe original text emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) commitment to fulfilling its institutional social responsibility, with a focus on sustainability, environmental awareness, societal care, environmental protection, and a friendly workplace. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and cultural appropriateness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and convey its commitment to social responsibility and sustainability.\n- The key areas of focus—sustainable development, environmentally conscious markets, caring for society, environmental protection, and a friendly work environment—are consistently included.\n- The use of terms like \"sustainable development,\" \"environmentally conscious markets,\" and \"friendly work environment\" is appropriate and aligns with common usage in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), while others use \"institutional social responsibility.\" The original text uses \"機構社會責任,\" which is more accurately translated as \"institutional social responsibility\" rather than \"corporate social responsibility,\" as the HKMA is a regulatory body, not a for-profit corporation.\n- **Institutional Name:** Some translations use \"The Monetary Authority\" or \"The Financial Services and Markets Commission,\" which are incorrect. The correct name is \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** While all translations are grammatically sound, some are more fluent and natural than others. For example, \"demonstrates this commitment\" (Translation 4) is more dynamic than \"fulfills this commitment\" (used in others).\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"broader society\" or \"wider community\" is acceptable, but \"society at large\" (Translation 5) is slightly more formal and may be more appropriate in a professional context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full and correct name of the institution: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use \"institutional social responsibility\" instead of \"corporate social responsibility\" to align with the original text.\n- Use more dynamic verbs such as \"demonstrates\" or \"embodies\" to convey active commitment.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and phrasing for a more polished and professional tone.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the correct name of the institution, appropriate terminology, and a fluent, professional tone.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to fulfilling its institutional social responsibility, with the goal of becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The HKMA demonstrates this commitment in various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for society at large, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly working environment.\n\nTo address the original Chinese text, the junior translators have all captured the core meaning: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic, with the aim of helping the economy weather the crisis.\n**Strengths of the translations:**\n- All translations correctly identify the subject (HKMA) and the action (introducing measures).\n- The phrase \"support individuals and businesses in need\" is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The use of \"weather the crisis,\" \"navigate through the challenging times,\" \"overcome its challenges,\" and \"through this difficult period\" all convey the intended meaning of helping the economy endure the pandemic's impact.\n**Weaknesses and areas for improvement:**\n- **\"Multiple measures\" vs. \"various measures\" vs. \"a number of measures\" vs. \"a series of measures\":** While all are acceptable, \"a series of measures\" (used in Translation 5) adds a slightly more formal and structured tone, which is appropriate for an official authority like the HKMA.\n- **\"Hong Kong's economy\" vs. \"the Hong Kong economy\":** Both are grammatically correct, but \"the Hong Kong economy\" is more concise and commonly used in formal writing.\n- **\"Thereby helping\" vs. \"thereby helping the Hong Kong economy\":** The phrase \"thereby helping\" is slightly vague without specifying the subject. Including \"the Hong Kong economy\" clarifies the intended beneficiary.\n- **\"Navigate through the challenging times\" vs. \"weather the crisis\" vs. \"overcome its challenges\":** While all are valid, \"weather the crisis\" is a well-established idiom that conveys resilience and endurance, which aligns well with the original intent.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and idiomatic, while clearly specifying the subject and the intended outcome. It should use a phrase that reflects the HKMA's role in providing a structured response to the crisis. \"A series of measures\" is more precise than \"multiple\" or \"various,\" and \"weather the crisis\" is a natural and widely understood expression. Using \"the Hong Kong economy\" is more concise and standard in formal writing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a series of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping the Hong Kong economy weather the crisis.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the sustainability of the global economy. As a critical component of society, the financial system is inevitably affected, and as part of this system, banks should actively manage climate risks. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge and is currently implementing a series of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include a three-phase approach to promoting the development of green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common framework with the industry to assess the current \"green benchmarks\" of banks, and collaborate with international organizations to provide technical support to the banking sector in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsulting with the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\nConsulting with the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\nConsulting with the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the regulatory expectations and requirements for the green and sustainable banking sector; as well as\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements regarding green and sustainable banking; and\nConsult with industry and other stakeholders regarding regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in prepositions, phrasing, and formality that affect fluency and naturalness in English.\nThe first and second translations use \"Consulting the industry and other stakeholders regarding\/on regulatory expectations...\" – both are acceptable, but \"on\" is slightly more natural in this context. The third translation uses \"Consulting with,\" which is more formal and commonly used in official or regulatory contexts, making it more appropriate for this type of text. The fourth translation introduces \"the green and sustainable banking sector,\" which is slightly more specific than the original, and ends with \"as well as\" instead of \"and,\" which changes the sentence structure slightly. The fifth translation uses \"regarding,\" which is correct but less common in formal regulatory language. The sixth translation uses the base form \"Consult\" instead of the gerund \"Consulting,\" which is less appropriate in this context as it should be part of a gerund phrase.\nThe most natural and appropriate phrasing would be to use \"Consulting with the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\" – this version is grammatically correct, uses the most natural preposition (\"on\"), and includes \"with\" for a more formal and professional tone, which is suitable for regulatory or policy-related texts. It also maintains the parallel structure and clarity of the original Chinese sentence.\n\n# Phase Three\n\nConcentrate on implementing, reviewing, and assessing the progress of banks in this area.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and adherence to the original's nuances. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately list the international organizations it participates in.\n- The key message—that the HKMA contributes to global climate-related financial efforts and learns from other regions—is consistently conveyed.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and regulatory terminology, such as \"High-Level Working Group\" and \"Sustainable Finance.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistencies:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" (Translation 4) or \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong\" (Translation 6), which is inaccurate and could confuse readers.\n- **Name of Organizations:** The \"Network for Greening the Financial System\" is more commonly abbreviated as NGFS, and including the acronym in parentheses improves clarity (Translation 1).\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"Climate-related Financial Risks High-Level Work Stream\" (Translation 2) or \"Bank Supervisors Group\" (Translation 4), which are less standard than \"High-Level Working Group\" or \"Banking Supervision Subgroup.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"jurisdictions\" (Translation 2) is more formal and less natural than \"regions\" or \"other areas\" in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"Through participation in these international organizations\" (Translation 6), which can be streamlined.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following should be prioritized:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Include standard acronyms in parentheses for clarity (e.g., NGFS).\n- Use established terminology such as \"High-Level Working Group\" and \"Banking Supervision Subgroup.\"\n- Ensure fluency and natural phrasing, avoiding overly formal or awkward expressions.\n- Maintain consistency in referring to \"regions\" or \"other areas\" rather than \"jurisdictions.\"\n- Ensure that the translation reflects the original's tone—professional yet accessible.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would integrate the most accurate terminology, maintain fluency, and ensure clarity and consistency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) participates in multiple international organizations, including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the High-Level Working Group on Climate-Related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Focus Group under the Banking Supervision Subgroup of the East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Meeting, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. Through its participation in these international organizations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the efforts of central banks and regulators in addressing climate change, and to draw on experiences and perspectives from other regions when developing its local framework.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and cultural appropriateness that affect the quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject and accurately list the working groups it participates in.\n- The key functions of the Research Working Group and the Data Gap-related Working Group are clearly conveyed in most translations.\n- The reference to the \"Banking System Stability\" chapter is consistently included, though some translations use \"Financial System Stability\" instead, which is slightly less precise.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency in the name of the organization. Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which may not be the official English name of the HKMA. The most accurate term is \"HKMA.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the Data Gap Filling Working Group\" or \"Data Gap Remediation Working Group,\" which are less standard than \"Data Gap Working Group\" or \"Data Gap Addressing Working Group.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"Green Finance Network of central banks and regulatory authorities\" is more precise than \"central bank and regulatory network for green finance\" or \"Green Finance Network of central banks and regulatory authorities.\"\n- **Nuance and Precision:** The phrase \"currently not available\" is used in several translations, but \"currently not available\" is slightly less precise than \"currently not accessible\" or \"currently not in possession.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the official English name of the organization: \"HKMA.\"\n- Use standard and widely accepted terminology for the working groups, such as \"Data Gap Working Group\" or \"Data Gap Addressing Working Group.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow in English.\n- Maintain precision in describing the purpose of the Data Gap Working Group, using terms like \"currently not accessible\" or \"currently not in possession.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the reference to the chapter, using \"Banking System Stability\" as it appears in the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA also participates in multiple working groups under the Green Finance Network of central banks and regulatory authorities, including the Microprudential Regulation Working Group, the Macrofinancial Working Group, and the Promoting Green Finance Working Group. In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established working groups: the Research Working Group and the Data Gap Working Group. The Research Working Group is responsible for conducting relevant research, while the Data Gap Working Group aims to develop a comprehensive list of data items required by regulatory authorities and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, which are currently not accessible. Details regarding the HKMA's work this year in promoting the development of green and sustainable banking can be found in the \"Banking System Stability\" chapter.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the main subject and accurately mention its partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in launching the Green Commercial Banking Alliance.\n- The key points about the HKMA’s roles (i) to (iv) are generally well conveyed, with most translations using parallel structure effectively.\n- The mention of the $2.3 trillion (or $23 trillion in one translation) in green and climate-related investment opportunities is present in most translations, though the figure is inconsistent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"i)\" to \"iv)\" with consistent numbering, but the phrase \"the HKMA i)\" is awkward. It should be \"the HKMA: i)\" for clarity.\n- **Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, but the phrase \"drives the development\" may be slightly more forceful than the original, which uses \"推動發展.\"\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly refers to the \"executive council\" instead of \"executive director\" and uses \"US$23 trillion\" instead of the correct \"2.3 trillion.\"\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly identifies the HKMA as the \"Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA),\" which is a factual error.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"regional representative\" instead of \"regional executive director\" and incorrectly states \"USD 2.3 trillion\" instead of \"23 trillion.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"transition into credible green banks\" and \"capitalizes on\" which are slightly less idiomatic than \"transform into\" and \"seize.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The correct name of the institution is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" not \"FSA.\"\n- The correct title is \"regional executive director,\" not \"regional representative\" or \"executive council.\"\n- The correct figure is \"23 trillion,\" not \"2.3 trillion.\"\n- The structure should use \"the HKMA: i)\" to maintain parallelism and clarity.\n- The verb \"transform into\" is more idiomatic than \"transition into\" or \"seize\" than \"capitalizes on.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, with corrections to factual and grammatical errors.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly launched the Green Commercial Banking Alliance with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in November to assist banks in emerging markets in developing strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive director of the alliance, the HKMA: i) promotes the development of green commercial banking in global financial markets; ii) provides a platform for commercial banks to engage in mutual learning, acquiring the necessary knowledge, tools, and business information to develop their own green finance roadmaps and transform into credible green banks; iii) facilitates communication and explores cutting-edge issues to advance the global green agenda; and iv) assists alliance members in collaboration and seizing the estimated $23 trillion in green and climate-related investment opportunities in emerging markets identified by the IFC over the next 10 years.\n\nLocally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with other financial regulators to coordinate the financial sector's measures in addressing climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing its green bond program, the HKMA has also jointly established the Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to handle cross-sectoral regulatory and market development issues. Details of the HKMA's work this year in advancing Hong Kong as a hub for green and sustainable finance are outlined in the chapter titled \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center.\"\n\n# Inter-Ministerial Task Force on Green and Sustainable Finance\nThe term \"Inter-Ministerial\" is appropriate if the group includes representatives from different government ministries. However, the original Chinese term \"跨機構\" more accurately translates to \"cross-institutional\" or \"cross-agency,\" which encompasses a broader range of organizations, not just government ministries.\n# Inter-Institutional Oversight Committee on Green and Sustainable Finance\nThis translation is more accurate in terms of the term \"跨機構\" as \"Inter-Institutional.\" However, \"Oversight Committee\" may not fully capture the supervisory or steering function implied by \"督導小組.\" The term \"committee\" is more formal and may not reflect the dynamic nature of a steering group.\n# Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance\n\"Inter-Agency\" is a suitable translation for \"跨機構,\" and \"Steering Group\" accurately reflects the function of \"督導小組.\" This translation is concise and captures the essence of the original term.\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Institutional Supervision Group\nThis translation is somewhat awkward in structure. \"Cross-Institutional Supervision Group\" is not a commonly used term in English and may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term.\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Committee\nThis translation is accurate in terms of the term \"跨機構\" as \"Cross-Agency\" and \"Steering Committee\" is a suitable translation for \"督導小組.\" However, \"Committee\" may be too formal for a group that is more likely to be a working group or steering group.\n# Cross-Institutional Supervisory Forum on Green and Sustainable Finance\n\"Cross-Institutional Supervisory Forum\" is not a commonly used term in English and may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term. \"Forum\" implies a more discussion-based or advisory body, which may not be the intended function of the group.\nBased on the above review, the best possible translation would be \"Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance.\" This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Chinese term and uses commonly understood English terms that reflect the function of the group.\nGreen and Sustainable Finance Inter-Agency Steering Group\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that warrant a critical review.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the purpose of the group: coordinating climate and environmental risk measures, promoting green finance, and supporting government climate strategy.\n- The names of the organizations involved are consistently translated, with most using the official English names (e.g., Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Securities and Futures Commission).\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the original information flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The original Chinese uses “督導小組,” which is best translated as “Steering Group.” However, translations 3 and 6 use “Steering Committee” and “Supervisory Group,” respectively, which are less precise and may imply a different type of body.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing. For example, “jointly initiated and established” (Translation 4) is redundant. Similarly, “with other members including” (Translation 1) is less fluid than “with other members including” or “comprising.”\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term “climate strategy” is used in all translations, but the original Chinese uses “氣候策略,” which is more accurately translated as “climate strategy” rather than “climate strategies” (used in Translation 6), which implies multiple strategies.\n- **Minor Errors:** Translation 1 incorrectly uses “the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau” instead of “the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau,” which is a minor but unnecessary addition of “the.”\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use “Steering Group” consistently, as it is the most accurate and commonly used term for “督導小組.”\n- Ensure fluency by avoiding redundancy (e.g., “jointly initiated and established” should be simplified to “jointly established”).\n- Maintain consistency in terminology, such as using “climate strategy” rather than “climate strategies.”\n- Ensure that the structure of the sentence is natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial sector’s response to climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government’s climate strategy. The Steering Group was jointly established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission in May, with other members including the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the Steering Group has established two technical working groups, one responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory matters, and the other for coordinating market development efforts across institutions.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the release of the Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, the six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem, the long-term goal of a greener and more sustainable future, and the five short-term action plans to address pressing issues.\n- The use of \"Steering Group,\" \"Supervisory Group,\" \"Oversight Group,\" and \"Steering Committee\" reflects different possible translations of “督導小組,” which is acceptable depending on the context and official title used in English.\n- The phrase \"short-term action plans\" is consistently used, which is appropriate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** The term “督導小組” is translated in multiple ways: \"Supervisory Group,\" \"Steering Group,\" \"Oversight Group,\" and \"Steering Committee.\" While all are acceptable, \"Steering Group\" is the most commonly used and appropriate term in policy and governance contexts.\n- **Fluency and Nuance:** Some translations use \"aiming to build\" or \"proposing to strengthen,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less fluent than \"outlining six areas to strengthen\" or \"to build a greener and more sustainable future.\"\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** The phrase \"in the long term\" is repeated in several translations, which is acceptable, but \"in the long run\" or \"long-term\" can be used for variety. Additionally, \"action agendas\" in one translation is less common than \"action plans.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use formal and policy-oriented language suitable for official announcements.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use \"Steering Group\" as the most consistent and appropriate term for “督導小組.”\n- Use \"outlining six areas to strengthen\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Use \"build a greener and more sustainable future\" for natural phrasing.\n- Use \"short-term action plans\" consistently.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is concise and avoids redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Steering Group released the Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, outlining six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem and build a greener and more sustainable future in the long term. The Steering Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues during the development process.\n\nThe original text mentions the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) holding a meeting to establish a supervisory group, with Mr. Yu Wai-man, the HKMA's Chief Executive, serving as co-chairman. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in terms of fluency, terminology, and proper identification of the individual.\nStrengths of the translations include the correct identification of the HKMA and the role of Mr. Yu as the Chief Executive. However, there are inconsistencies in the title of the meeting (\"inaugural meeting,\" \"establishment meeting,\" \"founding meeting\") and the term used for the group (\"supervisory committee,\" \"supervisory group\"). The original text uses the term \"督導小組,\" which is best translated as \"supervisory group\" rather than \"committee,\" as it implies a more informal or temporary structure.\nAdditionally, there are discrepancies in the name of Mr. Yu. Some translations use \"Yu Wai-man,\" others use \"Eddie Yue\" or \"Stephen YU,\" and one even incorrectly uses \"Stephen R. Cheung.\" The correct name is \"Yu Wai-man,\" and the title \"Chief Executive\" is more accurate than \"Chairman\" or \"President.\"\nThe phrase \"third from the right\" is correctly used in all translations, but the use of \"serving as co-chairman\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"serving as co-chair of the group.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use the correct name and title for Mr. Yu, the accurate term \"supervisory group,\" and a natural phrasing for the role of co-chair.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority held a founding meeting for the supervisory group, with Mr. Yu Wai-man, the HKMA's Chief Executive (third from the right), serving as co-chair of the group.\n\nThe original Chinese text is concise and formal, referring to an official release by a supervisory body regarding a strategy and action plans related to green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. The junior translators have produced several versions that are largely accurate but vary in terms of terminology, formality, and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"oversight group\" and \"action frameworks.\" While \"oversight group\" is acceptable, \"action frameworks\" is less common than \"action plans\" in this context. The phrasing is grammatically correct but slightly less natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Supervisory Group\" and \"key action plans.\" The capitalization of \"Supervisory Group\" may be appropriate if it is an official title, but it is not clear from the original text. \"Key action plans\" is a good choice.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Steering Group\" and \"action outlines.\" \"Steering Group\" is a common term for such bodies, and \"action outlines\" is less precise than \"action plans\" or \"action frameworks.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"steering committee\" and \"action plans.\" \"Steering committee\" is a slightly different term than \"steering group\" and may not be the most accurate translation of the original Chinese term. However, the rest of the translation is fluent and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"steering group\" and \"action plans.\" This is a strong translation, with natural phrasing and appropriate terminology.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Steering Group\" with a capital \"S\" and \"action plans.\" This is very similar to the fifth translation but with a more formal capitalization, which may be appropriate if the Steering Group is an official title.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"Steering Group\" (capitalized if it is an official title), \"Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy,\" and \"five key action plans.\" The term \"strategy plan\" is redundant, as \"strategy\" already implies a plan. \"Action outlines\" is less precise than \"action plans.\" Also, the use of \"has released\" is more formal and appropriate for an official announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Steering Group has released Hong Kong’s Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy and five key action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) support for responsible investment, emphasizing the integration of ESG factors and the influence of this focus on fund managers. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, consistency, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the concept of responsible investment and ESG integration.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology, such as \"responsible investment\" and \"environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"HKMA\" without spelling it out first, which may be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 6** repeat \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily, which can make the text feel redundant.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of the HKMA, which is a significant error.\n- **Translation 3** and **Translation 4** use \"HKMA\" after spelling it out, which is more reader-friendly and consistent.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"paying attention to\" instead of \"focusing on,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Introduce the full name of the organization first, followed by the acronym.\n- Avoid repetition of the full name when the acronym has already been introduced.\n- Use consistent and formal language, such as \"focusing on\" instead of \"paying attention to.\"\n- Ensure that the subject remains consistent throughout the sentence.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would introduce the HKMA by its full name first, use the acronym thereafter, avoid redundancy, and maintain a formal and precise tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment, which involves integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a major asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly focused on responsible investment, which will influence how its fund managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# 金管局的信念,\" translates to \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, but none fully capture the nuance and formality of the original.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:** \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\" is accurate and formal, but the use of the hashtag (#) is inconsistent with the original, which includes it. This may be a formatting choice, but it should be preserved if it's part of the original structure.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:** \"The Monetary Authority's Belief\" is too vague and lacks specificity. It omits \"Hong Kong\" and uses the singular \"Belief,\" which does not match the plural \"信念\" (beliefs) in the original.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:** \"The Belief of the Financial Services and Markets Commission\" is incorrect. The \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" is not the correct name for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This is a factual error.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:** \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\" is accurate but lacks the hashtag, which may be important for formatting or emphasis in the original.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:** \"# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Belief\" is close but uses the singular \"Belief,\" which does not match the plural \"信念\" in the original.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:** \"# Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\" is the most accurate, preserving the hashtag and using the correct plural form.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should preserve the hashtag, use the correct name for the authority, and match the plural form of \"beliefs.\" The sixth junior translator's version is the closest, but it could be slightly refined for clarity and formality. The hashtag is likely used for emphasis or to denote a section heading, so it should be retained. The full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more precise than \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" and the plural \"Beliefs\" is more accurate than the singular \"Belief.\"\n**Final Translation:**\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) belief that emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments will more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce ESG-related risks.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently and \"reduce ESG-related risks,\" which is appropriate. However, \"appropriately emphasizing\" is slightly wordy compared to \"emphasizing appropriately.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" is incorrect; the correct entity is the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, \"foreign exchange fund\" should be \"Exchange Fund\" to match the official name. The verb \"emphasizing\" is used without \"by appropriately,\" which slightly weakens the nuance of the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the first one, with the only difference being \"mitigate\" instead of \"reduce.\" \"Mitigate\" is more precise in the context of risk management, making this a stronger choice.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version uses \"HKMA\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" correctly. The phrase \"taking into account\" is slightly more formal than \"considering,\" which is acceptable. However, \"each investment\" is less accurate than \"various investments\" in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"it will more effectively achieve\" instead of \"it will more effectively achieve.\" The structure is slightly more repetitive.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"also reduce\" to connect the two outcomes, which is a natural flow. However, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" should be \"Exchange Fund\" for consistency with the official name.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct official name \"HKMA\" and \"Exchange Fund,\" maintain the nuance of \"appropriately emphasizing,\" and use precise terminology such as \"mitigate\" for ESG-related risks. It should also maintain a natural and fluent structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and mitigate ESG-related risks associated with investment activities.\n\n# Principles of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), ESG investments are generally given priority when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA incorporates the following responsible investment principles into its investment management process, depending on the circumstances.\n\n# Integration\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) integration of ESG factors into its investment processes, emphasizing their impact on long-term value and their role in risk identification and opportunity discovery.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. However, \"辨察風險及物色良機\" is translated as \"identify risks and opportunities,\" which is acceptable but slightly less dynamic than \"uncover opportunities.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"uncover opportunities,\" which is more vivid than \"identify.\" However, it uses \"integrates\" and \"incorporates\" interchangeably, which is slightly redundant.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This is very similar to the second, with the same strengths and weaknesses. It uses \"uncover opportunities\" and maintains consistency in terminology.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"it\" to refer to the HKMA, which is grammatically correct. However, it repeats \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" twice, which is slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is accurate and fluent. It uses \"seek opportunities,\" which is slightly less dynamic than \"uncover,\" but still acceptable. It also maintains consistency in terminology.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation has a critical error: it refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a major inaccuracy. It also uses \"seek opportunities\" and \"integrates\" and \"incorporates\" interchangeably, which is slightly redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use dynamic verbs such as \"uncover\" for \"物色良機.\"\n- Avoid redundancy in verb usage (e.g., \"integrates\" and \"incorporates\").\n- Ensure accuracy in institutional names.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects and therefore integrates ESG factors into its investment analysis process to identify risks and uncover opportunities. The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into the investment management processes of both public and private markets.\n\n# Proactive Exercise of Asset Ownership Rights\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase, “主動行使資產擁有權,” translates to \"proactively exercising ownership rights over assets.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\n1. **\"Exercising Ownership of Assets Proactively\"** – This translation is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, the placement of \"proactively\" at the end feels slightly awkward in English, where adverbs like \"proactively\" are often placed closer to the verb they modify.\n2. **\"Proactive Exercise of Ownership Rights\"** – This version is concise and uses \"ownership rights\" instead of \"asset ownership,\" which is more precise. However, it omits the word \"assets,\" which is important for clarity.\n3. **\"Proactively Exercise Asset Ownership\"** – This is a direct translation and maintains the structure of the original. However, \"exercise asset ownership\" is not idiomatic in English. The verb \"exercise\" is typically used with \"rights,\" not \"ownership.\"\n4. **\"Proactive Exercise of Asset Ownership\"** – This is similar to the third translation but omits the word \"rights.\" While it is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance of \"rights\" which is central to the concept of ownership.\n5. **\"Actively Exercising Asset Ownership\"** – This version uses \"actively\" instead of \"proactively,\" which is a slight deviation in tone. \"Actively\" implies ongoing action, while \"proactively\" suggests taking initiative, which is more aligned with the original Chinese.\n6. **\"Active exercise of asset ownership rights.\"** – This is grammatically correct and includes all key elements: \"active,\" \"exercise,\" \"asset ownership,\" and \"rights.\" However, the lowercase \"active\" and the lack of a hashtag may be inconsistent with the original formatting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and idiomatic in English. It should include all key elements: the proactive nature of the action, the exercise of rights, and the ownership of assets. Based on the above analysis, the most refined version would be:\n**\"Proactive Exercise of Asset Ownership Rights\"**\nThis version is concise, grammatically correct, and accurately reflects the original meaning. It uses \"proactive\" as an adjective to describe the exercise, which is more natural in English than placing the adverb at the end. It also includes \"rights\" to emphasize the legal aspect of ownership and specifies \"asset ownership\" for clarity.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) approach to exercising shareholder rights in listed companies, emphasizing the importance of ESG factors and the role of external investment managers in fulfilling ownership responsibilities. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the core message about exercising shareholder rights and ESG considerations.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology such as \"shareholder rights,\" \"ESG factors,\" and \"ownership responsibilities.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the message.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"safeguard the long-term value of its investments\" and \"long-term shareholder value,\" which are slightly repetitive and could be more varied.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"maintain the long-term value of investments\" and \"long-term shareholder interests,\" which is slightly less precise than \"value\" in the context of investments.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"proactively exercise ownership\" and \"with respect to its investments,\" which is slightly awkward and less direct.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of the \"HKMA,\" which is a critical error.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"investment portfolios\" in the last sentence, which is slightly more specific than the original, but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"invested companies\" and \"towards the investment portfolio,\" which are slightly less precise than \"investee companies\" and \"over its investments.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct name of the organization is used throughout (HKMA).\n- Use consistent and precise terminology, such as \"investee companies\" and \"ownership responsibilities over its investments.\"\n- Avoid repetition by varying expressions like \"safeguard,\" \"maintain,\" and \"protect\" the long-term value.\n- Ensure that the translation flows naturally in English, avoiding overly literal or awkward phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) appropriately exercises its shareholder rights in the listed companies it holds shares in, to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behavior taking into account ESG factors will help create long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects its external investment managers to actively exercise ownership rights by exercising voting rights and communicating with investee companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over its investments.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to collaborate with like-minded investors and regulators, promote sound long-term investment practices, and engage in public speaking to share ESG methodologies and encourage responsible investment.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" which is acceptable, though \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more precise. The use of \"operational approaches\" is slightly less natural than \"operational practices\" or \"methodologies.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"operational practices.\" However, the structure \"to promote... attending...\" is awkward and lacks clarity. It should be split into two clauses for better readability.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" is incorrect; the correct name is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The phrase \"sharing improved ESG methodologies\" is slightly more formal than the original, which may be acceptable but could be more aligned with the original tone.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses the correct name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"regulators\" instead of \"regulatory bodies,\" which is more natural in this context. The phrase \"best practices in ESG operations\" is slightly more general than the original, which mentions \"more refined ESG operational approaches.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version. It uses the correct name and structure. The only minor issue is the use of \"operational practices\" instead of \"operational approaches,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the fifth, with the same strengths and minor issues.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the full and correct name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" maintain the original's emphasis on \"more refined ESG operational approaches,\" and ensure the sentence structure is clear and natural. The phrase \"regulators\" is more concise and natural than \"regulatory bodies.\" The use of \"operational approaches\" is more precise than \"operational practices\" or \"methodologies.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulators to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also participates in public events and delivers speeches to share more refined ESG operational approaches and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nFor details regarding the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work on responsible investment this year, see the \"Reserve Management\" chapter.\n\n# The original text is:  \n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n### Review of Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as an active and responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of its external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate in meaning, uses correct terminology (\"external investment managers\"), and maintains a formal tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Active and responsible\" is slightly redundant; \"monitors\" is a bit passive compared to \"oversees.\"\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"As an active responsible investor, the HKMA oversees the ESG practices of outsourced investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"oversees\" effectively, and \"outsourced\" is a good synonym for \"external.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" is an abbreviation that may not be familiar to all readers; \"active responsible\" lacks a hyphen, which may be considered grammatically incorrect.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"# Financial Authority as a proactive responsible investor monitors the ESG practices of externally hired investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"proactive\" and \"externally hired,\" which are precise.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Financial Authority\" is not the correct name for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA); the hashtag is unnecessary and may be a formatting error.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Financial Services and Markets Authority, acting as a proactive and responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of externally hired investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"proactive and responsible\" effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"# As a proactive and responsible investor, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority oversees the ESG practices of its external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the HKMA, uses \"proactive and responsible,\" and \"oversees\" is a strong verb.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The hashtag is unnecessary and may be a formatting error.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as an active and responsible investor, oversees the ESG practices of external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the HKMA, uses \"oversees\" effectively, and is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Active and responsible\" is slightly redundant; \"external\" is less precise than \"external investment managers.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- Use precise and formal language.\n- Employ strong, active verbs like \"oversees.\"\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary formatting (e.g., hashtags).\n- Ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness.\n### Improved Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as a proactive and responsible investor, oversees the ESG practices of its external investment managers.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Expectations\nThe original Chinese text is \"# 金管局的期望,\" which translates to \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Expectations.\" \nReview of the translations:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:** \"# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Expectations\" – This is accurate and fluent. The use of \"The\" is appropriate, and the title format with the hash symbol matches the original.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:** \"# Expectations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" – This is also grammatically correct and natural. However, it uses a passive structure (\"Expectations of...\") which is slightly less direct than the active structure used in the first translation.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:** \"The Financial Services and Markets Commission's Expectations\" – This is incorrect. The \"金管局\" refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not the Financial Services and Markets Commission. This is a clear error in translation.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:** \"# Monetary Authority's Expectations\" – This is incomplete and lacks the full name of the authority. It may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the term \"Monetary Authority\" in the context of Hong Kong.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:** \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Expectations\" – This is accurate and concise. It omits the article \"The,\" which is acceptable in titles, but including it may be more formal and precise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:** \"# The Monetary Authority's Expectations\" – This is similar to the first translation but omits \"Hong Kong,\" which is necessary for clarity and specificity.\nReasoning for the best possible translation: The most accurate and natural translation would include the full name of the authority, use the appropriate article, and maintain the title format with the hash symbol. The fifth translation is close but lacks the article \"The,\" while the first translation includes it but is slightly more wordy. A balanced approach would be to use the full name with the article, as in the first translation, but ensure it is concise and natural.\nFinal translation: Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Expectations\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) commitment to integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and actively exercising asset ownership. It outlines the HKMA's approach to selecting and monitoring external investment managers, emphasizing the importance of shareholder rights in preserving long-term investment value.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and accurate, with a natural flow. However, it uses \"actively exercising asset ownership\" which is slightly awkward. Also, \"the HKMA\" is used inconsistently, switching between \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"the HKMA.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is more precise, using \"integrating ESG factors\" and \"monitoring their performance.\" It also includes \"as well as when monitoring their performance,\" which adds clarity. However, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is used inconsistently again.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"proactively exercising ownership rights\" and \"preserving the long-term value,\" which are more natural than some other versions. However, \"the HKMA\" is used inconsistently, and \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is not fully spelled out.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very accurate and maintains a consistent use of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It uses \"the matter of actively exercising asset ownership seriously,\" which is slightly wordy but clear. However, it repeats \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" unnecessarily.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"integrating ESG factors\" and \"the matter of actively exercising asset ownership seriously.\" However, it uses \"the HKMA\" inconsistently and omits the full name of the organization.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"proactively exercising asset ownership rights\" and \"supervising externally hired investment managers,\" which are accurate. However, the misidentification of the organization is a critical error.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should consistently use the full name of the organization, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" and maintain a natural, fluent tone. It should accurately reflect the original meaning, particularly the emphasis on ESG integration and the active exercise of asset ownership. The use of \"integrating ESG factors\" is more natural than \"incorporating ESG factors.\" Also, \"exercising shareholder rights\" should be clearly tied to the listed companies the HKMA holds.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places great emphasis on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and actively exercising asset ownership. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. Since the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights on the listed company stocks it holds is a fundamental approach to maintaining the long-term value of its investments, it requires appointed investment managers to take the matter of actively exercising asset ownership seriously.\n\n# Oversight by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nExternal investment managers are required to have their ESG performance in managing listed equity portfolios on behalf of the HKMA assessed. Through a communication initiative, the HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of external investment managers across various areas, including their ESG evaluation frameworks, communication with investee companies, and proxy voting activities. In 2020, the HKMA selected a number of external investment managers to participate in a pilot communication initiative, during which not only their ESG performance was evaluated, but also whether they appropriately exercised asset ownership on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative to identify external investment managers with problematic operational practices and take follow-up actions, with two examples provided. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is concise but lacks specificity by using \"the plan\" without clarifying what it refers to. It also uses \"the following examples illustrate two of them,\" which is slightly awkward.\nTranslation 2 correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"a plan,\" which is more natural than \"the plan.\" However, \"the following are two examples\" is somewhat vague and lacks the nuance of the original.\nTranslation 3 uses \"HKMA\" and \"program\" instead of \"plan,\" which may be more appropriate depending on the context. However, \"outsourced investment managers\" may not be the best term if the original refers to external or third-party managers.\nTranslation 4 introduces \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is not the correct entity in this context. It also uses \"subsequent actions\" instead of \"follow-up actions,\" which is less precise.\nTranslation 5 is accurate in identifying the HKMA and using \"program\" and \"follow-up actions.\" However, \"the following text lists two such examples\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\nTranslation 6 correctly identifies the HKMA and uses \"outsourced investment managers\" and \"review process,\" which may be more accurate than \"program.\" However, \"review process\" may not fully capture the intent of the original text.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use \"HKMA\" for clarity, \"external investment managers\" to match the original, and \"program\" or \"initiative\" to reflect the structured effort. The phrase \"takes follow-up actions\" is more natural than \"took follow-up actions\" if the text is in the present tense. The final sentence should be concise and clear, such as \"The following are two examples.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority identifies external investment managers with problematic operational practices through its program and takes follow-up actions. The following are two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) identified areas for improvement in Investment Manager A's ESG framework and that A took several steps to enhance its ESG practices. However, there are notable differences in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the original tone and structure.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the regulatory body and accurately translate the key actions taken by Investment Manager A.\n- The use of terms like \"ESG framework,\" \"investee companies,\" and \"external consultants\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- Most translations effectively convey the sequence of events: the HKMA's observation, the follow-up, the policy review, the appointment of consultants, and the establishment of the ESG committee.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in the name of the authority:** Some translations use \"HKMA,\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Supervisory Commission.\" The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Ambiguity in the role of the investment manager:** Some translations refer to \"Stock Investment Manager A,\" while others use \"Investment Manager A\" or \"Fund Manager A.\" The original text uses \"股票投資經理A,\" which is best translated as \"Stock Investment Manager A.\"\n- **Tense and structure:** Some translations use inconsistent verb tenses or awkward phrasing, such as \"has room for improvement\" versus \"had room for improvement.\"\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations include unnecessary words or phrases that do not appear in the original, such as \"the Authority followed up with A, which subsequently conducted...\" which is more verbose than necessary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Use \"Stock Investment Manager A\" to accurately reflect the original term.\n- Ensure consistent verb tenses and avoid redundancy.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing to maintain the original tone and clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that is accurate, concise, and maintains the original tone and structure, while using the correct terminology and consistent verb tenses.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority noted that Stock Investment Manager A's ESG framework had room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic approach to assessing investee companies. In response, the HKMA followed up with A, which subsequently conducted a comprehensive review of its company policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A also appointed external consultants to provide input on ESG procedures, demonstrating a commitment to accelerating reforms. Furthermore, A established a new ESG committee composed of senior management, highlighting its commitment to ESG and the support of senior management for these initiatives.\n\n# Case 2\n\nAfter reviewing the six translations, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) found deficiencies in the voting policies of stock investment manager B and requested a review, particularly due to B's full support of management proposals, which deviated from its own guidelines. B has committed to strengthening its voting policy, including increasing ESG team involvement and possibly voting against management on significant governance issues.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in word choice and structure.\n- The use of terms like \"ESG head,\" \"proxy voting guidelines,\" and \"significant governance issues\" is consistent and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistencies in terminology:** Some translations use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" (Translation 2), while others use \"HKMA\" or \"Monetary Authority\" (Translation 6). The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- **Minor grammatical issues:** Translation 6 uses \"strengthening its company's voting policy,\" which is redundant since \"its\" already refers to the company.\n- **Word choice:** \"Stock fund manager\" (Translation 3 and 5) is slightly less precise than \"stock investment manager\" used in most translations.\n- **Nuance and clarity:** Some translations use \"has requested\" (Translation 4), which implies an ongoing action, whereas the original suggests a completed action. \"Requested\" is more accurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Use \"stock investment manager\" for consistency with the original.\n- Use \"requested\" rather than \"has requested\" to reflect the completed action.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"its company's voting policy.\"\n- Ensure clarity and precision in terms like \"significant governance issues\" and \"proxy voting guidelines.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nAfter reviewing the voting practices of stock investment manager B, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) found deficiencies in B's voting policy across multiple areas and requested its ESG head to conduct a review. Notably, B had fully supported management's proposals in all past votes, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening its voting policy to meet expectations, including increasing the involvement of ESG team members and potentially voting against management on issues involving significant governance matters.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) approach to responsible investment through its dedicated partners, emphasizing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters and climate risk management. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology, and precision.\nStrengths include the consistent use of key terms such as “dedicated partners,” “ESG,” “responsible investment,” and “climate change risks.” Most translations accurately reflect the structure of the original text, including the two examples of managing climate risks. The use of terms like “green and sustainable warehouses” and “carbon reduction” is also well handled.\nWeaknesses include variations in the name of the authority—some use “Monetary Authority,” while others use “HKMA,” which is more precise. Additionally, some translations use “investment fund companies” or “portfolio companies,” which are not exact equivalents of the original Chinese term “投資組合公司.” The term “portfolio companies” is more standard in financial contexts and should be preferred. Also, the phrase “designing changes” in the first translation is awkward and should be “design modifications” or “design changes” as used in other translations.\nThe phrase “utilizing innovative operational technologies” is slightly less natural than “adopting innovative operational technologies” or “applying innovative operational technologies.” Furthermore, the use of “decarbonization” in some translations is more precise than “carbon reduction,” though both are acceptable.\nIn terms of fluency, the second and third translations are the most natural, with smooth sentence structures and appropriate use of prepositions and conjunctions. The fourth and fifth translations also perform well, though they occasionally use slightly less precise terms.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made: use “HKMA” consistently, use “portfolio companies” instead of “investment fund companies,” use “decarbonization” or “carbon reduction” depending on context, and ensure that the sentence structures are fluent and natural in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the most accurate terminology, maintain the original structure, and ensure natural fluency in English.\nIn private market investments, the HKMA collaborates with its dedicated partners to work with portfolio companies on ESG matters, thereby achieving responsible investment. The HKMA has observed that these dedicated partners consistently uphold their commitment to ESG, as they believe this approach helps create long-term value for portfolio companies and ensures the sustainability of returns. The two examples listed below demonstrate how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design modifications and the adoption of innovative operational technologies, and (ii) incorporating decarbonization factors into the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have had a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions, avoiding harmful substances, and simultaneously improving operational efficiency through cost reduction and energy conservation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and cultural appropriateness that affect the quality of each translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the investor and accurately describe the pest control company's environmentally friendly approach.\n- The key points—such as the risks of traditional pesticides, the use of traps and sensors, and the carbon emission metrics—are consistently captured across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, and the technical terms (e.g., \"biocides,\" \"carbon dioxide equivalent\") are appropriately used.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"investment\" in a slightly vague way, and \"dynamic sensors\" may not be the most precise term.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"monitor\" instead of \"detect\" or \"sense,\" which is slightly less precise in the context of sensors.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"The Monetary Authority\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less specific and potentially misleading.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"pest remains\" instead of \"dead pests,\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a critical error.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"carcasses\" instead of \"dead pests,\" which is more clinical and less natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the full and correct name of the authority is used: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use precise terminology such as \"biocides\" or \"biocidal agents\" consistently.\n- Choose more natural and commonly used terms, such as \"detect\" or \"monitor\" for sensors.\n- Maintain a consistent tone and avoid overly technical or clinical language unless necessary.\n- Ensure that the carbon emission metric is clearly and naturally expressed.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested in a pest control company that employs environmentally friendly solutions. Although traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively eliminate pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of dead pests can pose a threat to public health. In addition, the leakage and disposal of chemical substances can cause environmental problems. The company’s approach utilizes non-biocidal pest control methods, employing traps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. It also uses internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely detect whether pests have been captured. Through this new technology, the company can optimize collection routes for captured pests, reducing travel distances and thereby lowering carbon emissions. The company’s solution results in a net carbon footprint of just 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales, a low level comparable to low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing – a truly encouraging result.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in terms of fluency, accuracy, and adherence to English conventions. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the investor in green and sustainable warehouses.\n- The key concepts—net-zero carbon emission processes, sustainability of materials, and features like solar heating and rainwater collection—are consistently translated.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow from the premise to the conclusion.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in the name of the authority:** Some translations use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (correct), while others use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" (incorrect).\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"throughout the overall construction and operation\" or \"establishing standards and indicators to measure net-zero carbon benchmarks.\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"take into account the sustainability of materials and components used in the construction plans\" or \"natural daylighting\" instead of \"natural lighting.\"\n- **Cultural and contextual accuracy:** The term \"HKMA\" is more commonly used in official contexts, and \"rainwater harvesting\" is more standard than \"rainwater collection\" in environmental discussions.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use the full and correct name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Simplify and streamline sentence structures to enhance fluency and readability.\n- Use standard terminology such as \"rainwater harvesting\" and \"natural lighting\" for better alignment with environmental discourse.\n- Ensure that the translation reflects the formal tone of the original text while maintaining natural English phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\n(ii) The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted net-zero carbon emission procedures throughout their warehouse construction and operations, and have established standards and metrics for measuring net-zero carbon emissions. Their building plans also take into account the sustainability of the materials and components used. As a result, the warehouses constructed are highly carbon-efficient and possess sustainable features, including solar heating systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural lighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent consultant's assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse, calculated on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than that of a typical logistics facility. To further offset the carbon emissions generated during construction, 32,799 trees were planted (on a net basis) during the building process. Once completed, the warehouse’s daily operations will generate 26.9% less carbon emissions compared to a standard warehouse.\n"}

While Exchange Stabilization Fund is also a valid term, it typically refers to a specific type of fund used by central banks to stabilize currency values, which may not be the intended meaning here. Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an institution, not a fund, so it is not an appropriate translation. The other translations are either too brief (e.g., Exchange Fund) or lack the necessary context (e.g., # Foreign Exchange Fund). Therefore, the best translation would be Foreign Exchange Fund.\nForeign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor-General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which are set out on pages 187 to 289. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements fairly and accurately reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2020, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Basis of Opinion\nThe original Chinese text, \"# 意見的基礎,\" is a title that should be translated in a way that is both accurate and natural in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first translation, \"The Foundation of Opinion,\" uses \"Foundation\" which is a strong and appropriate term, but \"Opinion\" is singular, while the original Chinese uses \"意見\" (yìjiàn), which can be interpreted as either singular or plural depending on context. However, as a title, \"Opinion\" is acceptable.\nThe second translation, \"Basis of the Opinion,\" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward due to the definite article \"the,\" which is not typically used in titles unless it is necessary for clarity or emphasis.\nThe third translation, \"# Basis of Opinion,\" correctly retains the hashtag and uses \"Basis\" instead of \"Foundation,\" which is more commonly used in titles related to arguments or reasoning. However, the use of \"Opinion\" as singular may not fully capture the nuance of the original Chinese, which could imply a broader concept.\nThe fourth translation, \"Basis of opinion,\" is lowercase and lacks the hashtag, which may be important depending on the context in which the title is used. It is also less formal than the other options.\nThe fifth translation, \"The Foundation of Opinions,\" uses the plural form \"Opinions,\" which may be more accurate if the original Chinese is intended to refer to multiple opinions. However, the use of \"Foundation\" may be less common in this context compared to \"Basis.\"\nThe sixth translation, \"# Basis of the Opinion,\" is similar to the second one but includes the hashtag. The definite article \"the\" still feels unnecessary in a title.\nConsidering these options, the best translation would be one that is concise, natural, and appropriate for the context in which the title will be used. \"Basis of Opinion\" is a strong candidate as it is concise, uses a common term in academic or philosophical contexts, and omits unnecessary articles. If the hashtag is important, it should be retained. Therefore, the most suitable translation is:\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by these standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the course of auditing the financial statements as a whole and forming my opinion, but I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe original text is a formal statement regarding the responsibilities of a financial officer concerning the content of an annual report. The key elements to translate accurately are the title of the official role, the scope of the information (including and excluding specific sections), and the reference to the report itself.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Controller\" and \"Monetary Authority.\" The term \"Financial Controller\" may not be the most accurate title for the role in this context. \"Monetary Authority\" is correct, but the title may be more precisely \"Financial Management Commissioner\" or \"Financial Secretary\" depending on the jurisdiction.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Financial Management Bureau.\" The term \"Bureau\" may not be the correct term for the organization referenced in the original text, which is likely the \"Monetary Authority.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Financial Management Authority.\" This is closer to the correct title for the organization, but \"Financial Management Authority\" may not be the exact name used in the original context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is the most accurate in terms of title and organization name. \"Financial Secretary\" is a recognized title in Hong Kong's government structure, and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is the correct name of the organization.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"Financial Services Authority.\" \"Financial Services Authority\" is not the correct name of the organization referenced in the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial management officers\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The use of \"officers\" in plural may not match the singular role described in the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate translation should use the correct title for the role and the correct name of the organization. Based on the context, \"Financial Secretary\" is the most appropriate title in the Hong Kong context, and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is the correct name of the organization. The structure should clearly state that the Financial Secretary is responsible for all information in the 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and the auditor’s report.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for other information. This other information includes all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nWith regard to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the information I obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original Chinese text is a formal title referring to the responsibilities of an audit committee under specific governmental or financial oversight bodies. The junior translators have attempted to render this into English, but their translations vary in accuracy, clarity, and adherence to formal English conventions.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** \"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly identifies \"Audit Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" is not a standard title in English-speaking financial governance structures. Also, the phrase \"under the Commissioner... and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is awkward and unclear in structure.\n2. **Second Translation:** \"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Officer and Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" which is more standard.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Management Officer\" is not a recognized title in this context. The structure is still unclear.\n3. **Third Translation:** \"Responsibilities of the Financial Controller and the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Division and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with Respect to Financial Statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"with Respect to Financial Statements,\" which is formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Introduces \"Financial Controller\" and \"Financial Management Division,\" which are not mentioned in the original text. This adds unnecessary information and may mislead.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** \"The Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Secretary and the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee Regarding Financial Statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Regarding Financial Statements,\" which are appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Secretary\" is not the correct title for the role mentioned in the original text. It may refer to a different position in a different jurisdiction.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** \"Responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"regarding the financial statements\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, \"Financial Secretary\" is not the correct title. Also, the structure is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** \"Responsibilities of the Financial Commissioner and the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Financial Commissioner\" and \"Review Committee,\" which are closer to the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Review Committee\" may not be the exact term used in the original. Also, the structure is slightly unclear.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe original text refers to the \"Audit Committee\" under the \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" and the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" The most accurate and natural English rendering should use standard titles and maintain the formal tone of the original. \"Commissioner of Financial Management\" is likely a direct translation of a local title, and should be retained as such. \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is a recognized term in financial governance. The phrase \"in relation to financial statements\" is appropriate and formal.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer in preparing accurate financial statements in accordance with specific accounting standards and legal directives. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the original meaning.\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using appropriate legal terminology. It correctly refers to the \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\" However, it uses \"directions\" instead of \"instructions,\" which is slightly less precise in a legal context.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate but uses \"Exchange Fund Bill\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is a critical error. \"Bill\" refers to a proposed law, while \"Ordinance\" is a law already in force, making this a significant inaccuracy.\n**Translation 3** is very close to the original, with only minor issues. It uses \"instructions\" instead of \"directives\" and \"it\" instead of \"they\" or \"he,\" which may be less appropriate depending on the gender of the officer. However, the use of \"it\" is acceptable in formal writing if the subject is singular.\n**Translation 4** incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Secretary\" instead of the \"Financial Management Officer.\" This is a major deviation from the original text and could lead to confusion about the responsible party.\n**Translation 5** is accurate in most respects but uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants\" instead of \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants,\" which is a slight misnomer. It also uses \"they\" to refer to the officer, which may be less formal than \"he\" or \"she\" in a legal context.\n**Translation 6** is very close to the original, using the correct legal terms and structure. It uses \"instructions\" and \"it\" appropriately, though \"it\" may be less precise than \"they\" or \"he\" in a formal context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing financial statements that are true and fair in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The Financial Management Officer must also implement the internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management officer must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and where applicable, disclosing matters related to the going concern, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of the Translations:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"group's financial reporting process.\" It is grammatically correct and fluent, but \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is a more literal translation of \"外匯基金\" and may not be the standard term used in official English documents. \"Exchange Fund\" is more commonly used in financial contexts, especially in Hong Kong.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"supervising.\" While \"supervising\" is a valid synonym for \"overseeing,\" \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like financial reporting. The use of \"Exchange Fund\" is more appropriate than \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Group’s\" with a capital \"G.\" This is appropriate if \"Group\" refers to a specific entity, such as a company or organization. However, the original text does not capitalize \"集團,\" so this may be an unnecessary stylistic choice.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Group’s.\" This combines the literal translation with a capitalized \"Group,\" which may not be necessary unless it refers to a specific entity.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 2, using \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"overseeing.\" It is concise and accurate, with no unnecessary capitalization.\n6. **Translation 6** is similar to Translation 1, using \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"group's.\" It is grammatically correct but may not reflect the standard terminology used in financial governance structures.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe most accurate and natural translation should use the standard term \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" rather than the more literal \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Additionally, \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts than \"supervising.\" The term \"Group\" should be capitalized only if it refers to a specific entity, which is not indicated in the original text. Therefore, the best translation would use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"overseeing,\" and \"group's\" with a lowercase \"g.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements arising from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect all material misstatements. A material misstatement is one that, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements. Such misstatements may result from fraud or error.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misstatements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is generally higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events;\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicating to them any relationships and other matters that could reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, as well as any related safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, which outlines the process of identifying key audit matters based on communication with an audit committee and the conditions under which such matters may not be disclosed in the auditor’s report. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to professional terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key elements: the audit committee, the determination of key audit matters, and the conditions for non-disclosure.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial and auditing terminology, such as \"key audit matters,\" \"auditor’s report,\" and \"public interest.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"External Funds Advisory Committee,\" which may not be the standard term for the entity in question. It also uses \"I determine\" which may be too informal for a professional audit report.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is more likely the correct term, but the phrase \"based on communications with\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** introduces \"Review Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee,\" which may not be accurate and adds unnecessary detail not present in the original.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"External Funds Consultative Committee,\" which is not a standard term and may be confusing.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is more accurate, but the phrase \"legal regulations\" is slightly off; \"laws and regulations\" is more standard.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure, using \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"legal or regulatory requirements.\" However, it uses \"my auditor’s report,\" which may be redundant if the speaker is the auditor.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct and standard name for the committee, likely \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n- Use formal and professional language appropriate for an audit report.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in sentence structure.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary phrasing.\n- Accurately reflect the conditions for non-disclosure, particularly the balance between negative consequences and public interest.\n**Improved Translation:**\nBased on the original text and the analysis of the junior translations, the following is a refined and professional translation:\nBased on discussions with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless laws and regulations prohibit their disclosure, or in extremely rare circumstances where I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in the report would outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nAuditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a title and name: \"審計署署長 朱乃璋.\" This consists of the title \"審計署署長\" (Auditor General) and the name \"朱乃璋\" (Zhu Nai Zhang). The goal is to translate this into natural, fluent English while preserving the title's formality and the name's accuracy.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Auditor General Victor Chu\" – This translation correctly identifies the title but misrepresents the name. \"朱乃璋\" is \"Zhu Nai Zhang,\" not \"Victor Chu.\" The name is incorrectly anglicized, which is a significant error.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Auditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\" – This is accurate in both title and name. The name is correctly transliterated, and the title is properly capitalized. This is a strong translation.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Auditor General Chu Nai Zhang\" – This misorders the name. In Chinese, the surname comes first, so \"朱乃璋\" should be \"Zhu Nai Zhang,\" not \"Chu Nai Zhang.\" \"Chu\" is not the correct transliteration of \"朱.\"\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Auditor-General Chu Nai-chang\" – This uses a hyphen in the name (\"Nai-chang\") and incorrectly transliterates \"朱\" as \"Chu.\" Additionally, \"Auditor-General\" is a British variant, which may not be appropriate for a Chinese context.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Zhu Nai Zhang, Director of the Audit Office\" – While the name is correct, the title is translated as \"Director of the Audit Office,\" which is less formal and less commonly used than \"Auditor General.\" This may not be the most appropriate title for the position.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Auditor General Chu Nai Zhang\" – This repeats the error from Translation 3, misordering the name as \"Chu Nai Zhang\" instead of \"Zhu Nai Zhang.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation is **Translation 2: \"Auditor General Zhu Nai Zhang.\"** It correctly uses the formal title \"Auditor General\" and accurately transliterates the name \"朱乃璋\" as \"Zhu Nai Zhang.\" The title is capitalized appropriately, and the name follows the standard Chinese naming convention in English transliteration.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAuditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\n# 1 Main Business\n\nThe original text outlines the legal framework under which the Financial Management Officer manages the Exchange Fund, emphasizing the source of their authority and the Fund's primary objectives. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the original meaning.\nTranslation 1 is clear and grammatically sound, but it misattributes the delegation of powers. It incorrectly states that the Financial Secretary delegates powers to the Financial Management Officer, whereas the original text indicates that the Financial Management Officer acts under the authority granted by the Financial Secretary.\nTranslation 2 is concise and accurate, correctly identifying the source of the Financial Management Officer’s authority and the Fund’s objectives. However, it uses “main functions” instead of “primary business,” which is slightly less precise than the original.\nTranslation 3 misrepresents the relationship between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Officer. It suggests that the Financial Management Officer acts as a manager of the Fund, which is not accurate. The original text states that the Financial Management Officer is granted authority by the Financial Secretary.\nTranslation 4 incorrectly states that the Financial Secretary manages the Fund, which contradicts the original text. The Fund is managed by the Financial Management Officer, not the Financial Secretary.\nTranslation 5 is accurate in terms of content but uses “safeguard” instead of “defend,” which is a minor stylistic choice. It also correctly identifies the source of the Financial Management Officer’s authority.\nTranslation 6 is the most accurate in terms of structure and meaning. It correctly identifies the source of the Financial Management Officer’s authority and uses “defend” as in the original. However, it mistakenly refers to the “Currency Fund Ordinance” instead of the “Exchange Fund Ordinance.”\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, use appropriate terminology, and maintain grammatical correctness and fluency. It should correctly identify the Financial Management Officer as the manager of the Fund, under the authority of the Financial Secretary, and clearly state the Fund’s primary objectives.\nThe improved translation should use “defend” as in the original, refer to the “Exchange Fund Ordinance,” and clearly state that the Financial Management Officer manages the Fund under the authority granted by the Financial Secretary.\nThe Fund is managed by the Financial Management Officer under the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the Fund’s manager, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund’s primary function is to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, style, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology and Consistency**: \n   - The term \"Support Portfolio\" is used in most translations, but the third and fourth translators use \"Supporting Portfolio\" and \"support portfolio\" respectively, which are less consistent with the formal tone of the original text.\n   - \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" is used in most translations, but the third and fourth translators use \"Strategic Assets Portfolio\" and \"strategic asset portfolio\" respectively. The correct form should be \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" to match the original's structure.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - The first and sixth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The sixth translation uses \"currency board system\" instead of \"monetary authority system,\" which is more accurate in the context of Hong Kong's financial system.\n   - The second and fifth translations use \"debt and equity markets\" and \"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\" respectively, which are slightly more formal and precise than \"bond and stock markets\" and \"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\"\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**:\n   - The fifth and sixth translations correctly use \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX)\" and \"The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\" respectively, which are appropriate for formal financial documents.\n   - The sixth translation uses \"accounted for in the fund's books,\" which is more natural in financial contexts than \"included in the fund's accounts.\"\n4. **Punctuation and Style**:\n   - The fifth and sixth translations use \"Note 32\" with a capital \"N,\" which is standard in financial reporting.\n   - The first and sixth translations use \"operating segments\" and \"information on operating segments,\" which are more natural than \"segmental information\" or \"details of the operating segments.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe fund's assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's currency board system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched to the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for strategic purposes and are accounted for in the fund's books. Information on the operating segments is presented in Note 32.\n\n# 2 Significant Accounting Policies\n\n# 2.1 Statement of Compliance with Guidelines\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (which comprise all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards, and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and Hong Kong Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\") is set out below.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants issuing new or revised financial reporting standards, their effective dates, and the impact of their adoption on the Group's accounting policies. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to professional financial terminology.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and grammatically correct. However, it uses \"the current accounting period\" without specifying whether it refers to the Group's period, which may be important for clarity. Also, \"may be adopted early\" is slightly less formal than \"available for early adoption.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants,\" which is the full and correct name. However, it uses \"became effective for the first time during the Group’s current accounting period or were available for early adoption,\" which is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"newly introduced or revised\" which is slightly redundant. Also, \"accounting policy changes (if any)\" is slightly awkward in placement.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is concise and accurate. It uses \"HKFRS\" as an abbreviation, which is appropriate in a financial context. However, it omits the phrase \"first-time adoption\" and instead says \"early adoption,\" which may not fully capture the nuance of the original.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"this reporting period of the Group\" which is slightly more natural than \"current accounting period.\" However, \"affected by the first-time adoption\" is slightly less precise than \"resulting from the first-time adoption.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"first adoption\" rather than \"first-time adoption,\" which is slightly less precise. However, it is otherwise clear and professional.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full and correct name of the institution: \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\"\n- Clearly specify that the standards became effective or were available for early adoption during the Group's current reporting period.\n- Accurately reflect that the changes in accounting policies resulted from the first-time adoption of the applicable standards.\n- Use precise financial terminology such as \"first-time adoption\" and \"early adoption.\"\n- Ensure clarity and conciseness in the sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued certain new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which became effective for the Group's current reporting period or were available for early adoption. Any changes in accounting policies resulting from the Group's first-time adoption of the applicable standards for the current and prior reporting periods are reflected in these financial statements, with related information disclosed in Note 3.\n\n# 2.2 Basis for Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe original text discusses the composition of a group's financial statements and references the disclosure of key subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates in specific notes. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify that the group financial statements include the group's own statements and its interests in joint ventures and associates.\n- Most translations correctly reference Notes 17 and 18 for the disclosure of the main businesses of subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.\n- The use of terms like \"subsidiaries,\" \"joint ventures,\" and \"associates\" is consistent with standard financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use redundant phrasing, such as \"the group's financial statements\" repeated unnecessarily (e.g., \"the group's own financial statements\").\n- The term \"interests in associated companies and joint ventures\" is slightly less precise than \"interests in associates and joint ventures,\" which is more commonly used in financial reporting.\n- The phrase \"principal business activities\" is more formal and appropriate than \"main businesses\" or \"main activities,\" though all are acceptable.\n- Some translations use \"set out\" or \"disclosed,\" which are acceptable, but \"described\" is more neutral and commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use concise and standard financial terminology.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"the group's financial statements\" once.\n- Use \"interests in associates and joint ventures\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"principal business activities\" for formality and precision.\n- Ensure that the structure is clear and flows naturally in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be concise, use standard financial terminology, and maintain clarity and fluency.\nThe group financial statements include the group's financial statements and its interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal business activities of the major subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are described in Notes 17 and 18.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value:  \n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value and recognized in profit or loss (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets measured at fair value and recognized in other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);  \n- Gold (Note 2.10); and  \n- Investment property (Note 2.11).\n\nPreparing financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions, which affect the adoption of accounting policies and the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the relevant circumstances. In the absence of other readily available data, these estimates and assumptions are used as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The estimated results may differ from actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions affect only the current accounting period, the revisions will be recognized within that period. However, if the revisions affect both the current and future accounting periods, the revisions will be recognized in the current period and future periods accordingly.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal financial disclosure statement, and the goal is to convey the relationship between management's judgments and estimates, their impact on financial statements, and the sources of uncertainty, all of which are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and fluent. It accurately captures the relationship between the judgments, their impact, and the uncertainty sources. However, the structure is slightly awkward, particularly with the placement of \"as well as management's judgments.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also grammatically sound and fluent. It clearly separates the two main ideas: management's judgments and the sources of uncertainty. However, it uses \"under the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" which is slightly less precise than \"regarding the adoption of.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It correctly identifies the key sources of uncertainty and their relation to management's judgments. However, it omits the phrase \"that have a significant impact on the financial statements,\" which is crucial for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is concise but lacks the nuance of the original. It uses \"significant to the financial statements\" instead of \"that have a significant impact on the financial statements,\" which is less precise. It also omits the mention of the adoption of the standards.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. It clearly separates the two main ideas and uses \"material impact\" instead of \"significant impact,\" which is acceptable in financial contexts. However, \"regarding these estimates\" is slightly vague.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"made in adopting\" to reflect the original's \"就採納...所作出.\" However, it places the phrase \"that have a significant impact on the financial statements\" after \"judgments,\" which slightly disrupts the flow.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly and concisely convey that the primary sources of uncertainty in management's judgments and estimates—regarding the adoption of the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a significant impact on the financial statements—are disclosed in Note 2.19. It should maintain the formal tone of the original and ensure that all key elements are included without redundancy or ambiguity.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe primary sources of uncertainty in management's judgments and estimates regarding the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a significant impact on the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to align with the presentation format of the Group's financial statements for this year.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, typical of financial reporting language. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"presentation method,\" which is slightly less common in financial contexts than \"presentation format.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"a number of,\" which is slightly less formal than \"certain\" or \"some of the.\"\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the best version, using \"presentation format\" and \"Group's financial statements.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"current year's group financial statements,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise than \"for this year.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"reporting format,\" which is slightly different from \"presentation format\" and may not be as precise.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"conform with the presentation,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than necessary for this context.\nThe best version would retain the formal tone of the original while using the most natural and commonly used terms in financial reporting. \"Presentation format\" is more standard than \"presentation method\" or \"reporting format.\" Also, \"for this year\" is more concise and natural than \"for the current year\" or \"current year's.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to align with the presentation format of the Group's financial statements for this year.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and Non-controlling Interests\n\nA subsidiary refers to an entity controlled by the Group. Control over an entity exists when the Group, through its involvement in the entity's operations, is exposed to risks or entitled to rights related to variable returns, and has the power to direct the entity's activities in a manner that affects those returns. When assessing whether the Group has control, only the substantive rights held by the Group and other parties are considered.\n"}
