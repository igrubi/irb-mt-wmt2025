{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant changes, with numerous scenes that even the best scriptwriters could not have imagined. In last year's Annual Report, I noted that the 2017 performance of financial markets was \"surprisingly positive,\" while also highlighting \"underlying concerns\" about the outlook. Looking back at 2018, it might be described as \"first joy, then sorrow.\" Shortly after several global stock indexes hit record highs in January, the bullish sentiment was quickly met with the cold front of US-China trade tensions. Meanwhile, the Brexit impasse continued, the geopolitical environment deteriorated, and the US Federal Reserve conducted four interest rate hikes, causing the market's optimistic atmosphere to rapidly reverse, and asset prices to sharply decline throughout the year. The MSCI World Index fell by as much as 20.3% from its peak to its trough, declining by about 10% for the year, making it the worst-performing year since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its peak, declining by 13.6% for the year, recording the largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# United and Steady, the Pillar of Confidence\n\nDespite the volatility of the external environment, Hong Kong’s financial system remains robust, and the currency markets operate smoothly. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented for thirty-five years, has successfully withstood the test of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the Global Financial Crisis, approximately HKD 1,000 billion equivalent of funds have flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as US interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the US continued to widen, leading to an increase in \"sell Hong Kong dollars, buy US dollars\" carry trade activities. The Hong Kong dollar weakened against the US dollar at the beginning of the year, and the \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" (CU), established in 2005, was first triggered in April and was triggered a further 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fulfilled its CU obligations in accordance with the established mechanism, orderly and transparently absorbing HKD 103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders in the market. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points in 2018, and banks also raised their prime rates following the US interest rate hikes in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operational mechanism of the CU to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable part of interest rate normalisation in Hong Kong and a normal function of the LERS. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for Hong Kong’s LERS at the end of last year, and the HKSAR Government also emphasized that the LERS is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s currency stability. This has helped to strengthen public confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\n# The original title, “銀行體系 穩中有進,” translates to “Banking System: Stability with Progress.” The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: “The banking system is stable with progress.” This is grammatically correct but somewhat awkward in phrasing. “Stable with progress” is not a common collocation in English.\nTranslation 2: “Banking system maintains stability with steady progress.” This is more fluent and natural, using “maintains stability” and “steady progress” effectively. However, it omits the hashtag, which may be important for formatting or emphasis.\nTranslation 3: “Banking Sector: Steady Progress Amid Stability.” This version uses “Banking Sector” from the dictionary and presents the phrase in a more journalistic or headline style. However, it reverses the original order, placing “progress” before “stability,” which may slightly alter the nuance.\nTranslation 4: “The banking system is steadily progressing.” This is concise but omits the idea of stability, which is a key component of the original phrase.\nTranslation 5 and 6: “# Banking System Steady Progress” are very brief and omit the idea of stability entirely, which is a significant part of the original message.\nThe best approach would be to retain the hashtag, use “Banking System” from the dictionary, and convey both stability and progress in a natural, balanced way. A more fluent and accurate translation would be: “# Banking System: Steady Progress Amid Stability.” This version includes the hashtag, uses the correct term from the dictionary, and accurately reflects the original meaning with natural English phrasing.\n# Banking System: Steady Progress Amid Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, it uses \"conduct and ethics\" instead of \"conduct,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary. It also uses \"operational details of this mechanism\" which is slightly less precise than \"operational details of the regime.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and tone. It uses \"asset-liability risk\" instead of \"balance sheet risk,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable. It also uses \"requirements in line with the regime\" which is slightly less precise than \"requirements compliant with the regime.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with a good use of terms from the dictionary. It uses \"Risk management\" with a capital \"R\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase version. It also uses \"soundly and prudently\" which is slightly redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with excellent fluency and adherence to the dictionary. It uses \"Financial Stability Board (FSB)\" which is more precise than just \"Financial Stability Board.\" It also uses \"compliance with these standards\" which is more natural than \"requirements compliant with the regime.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"the conduct of banks\" which is slightly less precise than \"the conduct and ethics of banks.\" It also uses \"mechanisms meeting these requirements\" which is slightly less precise than \"mechanisms compliant with the regime.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"prudently and soundly\" which is slightly redundant. It also uses \"measures compliant with the mechanism\" which is slightly less precise than \"requirements compliant with the regime.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the dictionary terms precisely. It should avoid redundancy and use natural English expressions. Based on the above review, the fourth junior translator's version is the closest to the ideal, with minor adjustments to enhance clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe 2008 Global Financial Crisis exposed various flaws and vulnerabilities in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and financial institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in the banking sector. The HKMA's banking supervision focuses on two aspects: first, prudential supervision of banks' balance sheet risks, and second, banks' conduct, both of which are equally important. In terms of balance sheet risk supervision, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) under the G20, the HKMA is responsible for fully implementing international regulatory standards to ensure the banking sector in Hong Kong operates in a sound and prudent manner. At the end of last year, the capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong banks reached 20.3%, which is significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%, and also a marked improvement from the 14.7% level during the Global Financial Crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks in the fourth quarter of last year reached 167.6%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Global Financial Crisis, where public money had to be used to rescue \"Too Big To Fail\" financial institutions, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has established international standards for the resolution regime of financial institutions. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented compliance with these standards. The Resolution Office under the HKMA is implementing the operational details of the regime, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the LAC Rules, and more related rules will be introduced in the future.\n\nGiven the continuous rise in property prices, the HKMA took proactive measures and introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the local banking system would have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks should the property market reverse. These measures proved highly effective: the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgages dropped from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt servicing ratio (DSR) also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. Bank credit growth recorded a moderate increase of 4.4% during the year, with overall asset quality remaining strong. The classified loan ratio for retail banks further declined to 0.5%, significantly lower than both international and Hong Kong historical averages. Banking sector profits continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%. Several international banking groups operating in Hong Kong delivered strong performance, becoming key pillars of their group profits.\n\n# Steadfast and Benevolent Culture: Leading by Example from Above, Following by Example from Below\n\nIn regulating the conduct of banks, the HKMA established the Banking Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes, in addition to setting various regulatory requirements targeting the fundamental conduct of banking operations, we have vigorously promoted bank culture reform in recent years, encouraging banks to foster a sound culture through governance, incentive systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, aiming to ensure that leadership within banks sets a good example, thereby restoring and enhancing customers' trust and respect for banks at their core. Following the provision of specific guidelines to all Hong Kong banks in 2017, the HKMA further introduced supervisory measures for bank culture by the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, ensuring the three pillars supporting a sound bank culture are effectively executed.\n\nAlthough internet and mobile financial services are global trends, the HKMA continued to promote financial inclusion last year, catering to communities unable to use new technologies. For example, we, together with the Hong Kong Association of Banks, encouraged convenience stores to offer elderly customers the \"Electronic Payment Services\" cash withdrawal service without the need for shopping. The network of such convenience stores has now expanded to over 300 locations. We also contacted Hongkong Post to introduce the Elderly Cash Withdrawal Service at seven main post offices located in the outlying islands and New Territories. The banking sector has responded positively to the HKMA's recommendations, actively increasing barrier-free facilities to provide inclusive banking services. One example is the number of voice navigation ATMs, which has increased more than tenfold within a year to over 700 units. In addition, under the active promotion of the HKMA, we expect that more physical branches and mobile banking services will be established by banks in remote areas in the near future, making banking more convenient for the public.\n\n# Smart Banking: A New Experience\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"New Era of Smart Banking,\" \"FPS,\" \"Common QR Code,\" and \"retail payment platform.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points—such as the launch of FPS and the impact of the Common QR Code—are well conveyed.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with minimal errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) while others use \"FPS\" alone. The dictionary allows both, but consistency is key. \"FPS\" should be used consistently once introduced.\n- **\"Electronic Payment Tools\" vs. \"Payment Schemes\":** The original text uses \"電子支付系統\" (electronic payment systems), which is translated as \"payment schemes\" in the dictionary. However, some translations use \"electronic payment tools,\" which is not an exact match and may mislead readers.\n- **\"Registered Records\" vs. \"Registered Users\" or \"Registered Accounts\":** The term \"登記紀錄\" is translated as \"registered records\" in one translation, which is not idiomatic. \"Registered accounts\" or \"registered users\" is more natural.\n- **\"Transaction Number\" vs. \"Transaction Volume\":** The dictionary specifies \"transaction number\" for \"交易量,\" but \"transaction volume\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and better reflects the meaning of the original.\n- **\"Chinese Yuan\" vs. \"Renminbi\":** While both are correct, \"Renminbi\" is the official term used in financial contexts and should be preferred for consistency with the dictionary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"FPS\" once introduced.\n- Use \"payment schemes\" instead of \"electronic payment tools\" to align with the dictionary.\n- Replace \"registered records\" with \"registered accounts\" or \"registered users.\"\n- Use \"transaction volume\" instead of \"transaction number\" for better clarity.\n- Use \"Renminbi\" instead of \"Chinese yuan\" for consistency with the dictionary and financial terminology.\n---\nThe HKMA closely collaborated with the banking and information technology industries to launch the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of Hong Kong's fintech and providing citizens with a fresh payment and banking service experience. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) in September. It is a globally unique retail payment platform that breaks down barriers between various payment schemes and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy 24\/7 real-time fund transfer services in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. The HKMA also simultaneously introduced the world's first \"Common QR Code\" standard and application, enabling merchants to connect multiple payment schemes through a single QR code. Since its launch, the \"Faster Payment System\" has been widely welcomed by the public. Within just six months, the number of registered accounts exceeded 2.58 million, with an average daily transaction volume of 60,000, and the average transaction amount being HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 respectively.\n\nIn May last year, the HKMA issued the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks, prompting 33 institutions to apply for virtual bank licences. As of mid-April this year, four licences have been issued, and they are expected to commence operations officially within the year. Virtual banks help drive the development and innovation of fintech in Hong Kong, offering new services and experiences for individuals and SMEs, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA released the Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework in July. Banks will open external endpoints for their products and services in four phases, creating a more flexible and liberalised fintech environment, allowing bank customers to more conveniently integrate account data, access information, and select services that best meet their needs. This year, a total of 42 new technology products used the HKMA's Fintech Supervisory Sandbox for testing, with 28 of them completing trials, and the relevant products and services have been successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"eTradeConnect,\" \"HKMA,\" \"trade finance platform,\" and \"distributed ledger technology (DLT).\" \n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- The use of terms like \"cross-border trade finance activities\" and \"enhance the efficiency of banks\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"aims to enhance\" which is slightly vague compared to the original's definitive tone (\"will enhance\").\n- **Translation 2** uses \"developed\" without specifying the timeline, which is less precise than \"officially launched.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"approvals\" instead of \"applications,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary term \"trade finance applications.\"\n- **Translation 4** starts with \"The HKMA's eTradeConnect,\" which is grammatically awkward and omits the collaborative development with banks.\n- **Translation 5** repeats \"trade finance platform\" unnecessarily and uses quotation marks inconsistently.\n- **Translation 6** is the most fluent and grammatically sound, but it could be slightly more concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Maintain a clear and concise structure.\n- Use active voice where appropriate.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and natural flow in English.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary repetition.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would combine the strengths of the best elements from the junior translations while ensuring clarity, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, in collaboration with several banks, officially launched eTradeConnect in October last year. This trade finance platform, which employs distributed ledger technology, will enhance the efficiency of banks in processing trade finance applications. eTradeConnect is currently testing connections with relevant platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade finance activities.\n\nFintech is not only widely applied in daily life but has also entered the compliance and regulatory fields in recent years. The HKMA encourages banks to use regulatory technology (Regtech) to assist in handling daily operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism. At the same time, the HKMA is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Consolidate and Enhance Financial Strength\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Junior Translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of the dictionary terms. However, \"conference activities\" is a bit vague and less precise than \"conferences\" or \"conference events.\" Also, \"enhance market awareness, understanding, and participation in green finance\" is slightly repetitive.\n2. **Second Junior Translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"Green Finance\" consistently in title case, which is appropriate. However, \"multiple Green Finance conference activities\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n3. **Third Junior Translator**: This version is very similar to the second, with a slightly more natural flow. It uses \"expand its bond and project finance markets\" which is slightly more dynamic than \"develop its bond and project finance markets.\" However, \"create new development space\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"open up new development space.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator**: This translation is very strong, with natural phrasing and accurate use of the dictionary terms. It uses \"hosted several Green Finance conference activities\" which is more natural than \"held multiple conference activities.\" The phrase \"equivalent to more than three times that of 2017\" is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator**: This translation is very close to the fourth, with a slightly more casual tone. It uses \"green finance conferences\" instead of \"Green Finance conference activities,\" which is more natural. However, \"major international events\" is slightly less precise than \"large-scale international conferences.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"promoting green finance\" instead of \"developing green finance,\" which is slightly different in tone but still acceptable. The phrase \"enhance market understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance\" is slightly more natural than the others.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, natural, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the fourth and sixth translations are the strongest, with the fourth being slightly more natural in phrasing and the sixth being slightly more precise in terminology.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe competition among international financial centres is a contest of soft power. We must constantly adapt to changes in economic, social, and technological developments, seize opportunities, and continuously expand new development space for Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance is a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project finance markets. The HKMA supports and coordinates with the HKSAR Government in developing green finance. In addition to coordinating with the HKSAR Government to prepare the Government Green Bond Programme of HKD 100 billion, we also hosted several green finance conferences last year, including two large-scale international conferences, to enhance market awareness, understanding, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuers to participate in the Green Bond Grant Scheme and Hong Kong’s Green Finance Certification Scheme launched by the government last year. Last year, the volume of green bonds issued in Hong Kong exceeded USD 11 billion, equivalent to more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown increasing interest in infrastructure projects and related initiatives. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and the number of IFFO partners has since more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) jointly hosted a High-level Roundtable for the first time, discussing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role in supporting Central State-owned Enterprises (CSoEs) in their \"going global\" initiatives, laying a solid foundation for future collaborative development opportunities between CSoEs and Hong Kong's financial and professional services sector.\n"}

being more commonly used in general contexts and the latter often appearing in formal or policy-related discussions. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, though some could be improved in terms of formatting and consistency.\nThe first junior translator used \"Currency stability,\" which is correct and natural, but lacks the capitalization that might be expected in a heading or title. The second, fifth, and sixth translators used \"Monetary Stability,\" which is also correct and appropriate, especially in formal or technical contexts. The third and fourth translators used \"# Currency Stability,\" which includes a hashtag, likely intended for formatting or labeling purposes, but this may not be necessary unless the context specifically requires it.\nConsidering the original text is simply 貨幣穩定, without any additional formatting or context, the most appropriate translation would be \"Currency stability\" or \"Monetary Stability,\" depending on the intended tone and usage. Since the original text is a standalone term and not part of a larger document or heading, \"Currency stability\" is the more natural and widely used choice.\nFinal translation:\nCurrency stability\n\n# April 12th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" as specified in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" and \"London trading hours.\" However, it uses \"marking the first time the undertaking has been triggered\" which is slightly less precise than \"marking the first time the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking has been triggered.\"\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"CU\" instead of \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" as specified in the dictionary. This is a direct violation of the instructions and reduces clarity for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses a slightly more complex sentence structure. It is grammatically correct and fluent, though the phrasing \"marking the first time since...\" is slightly awkward compared to \"marking the first time the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking has been triggered.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is concise and accurate, using the correct terminology from the dictionary. It avoids redundancy and is the most straightforward of the translations.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 3 and 1, with a slightly more elaborate structure. It is grammatically sound and uses the correct terminology, but the sentence structure is slightly more complex than necessary.\n6. **Translation 6** is concise and accurate, using \"optimization measures\" instead of \"enhancements\" or \"measures to optimize.\" It also uses \"27 times\" instead of \"a total of 27 times,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, fluent, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure clarity for all readers. Based on the above analysis, the best elements are found in Translations 1, 4, and 6. A synthesis of these would produce the most accurate and natural English translation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA's weak-side Convertibility Undertaking at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar was triggered during London trading hours, marking the first time since the HKMA introduced three measures to optimize the Linked Exchange Rate System in 2005. In 2018, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times.\n\n# July 24th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely serving as a heading or marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with the most common being \"July 24th\" and \"July 24.\" The use of \"July 24th\" is more standard in English for dates, as it includes the ordinal indicator \"th,\" which is typically used in formal or written English. However, in some contexts, especially in headlines or lists, \"July 24\" may be preferred for brevity.\nThe inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in translations 1, 4, and 6 is consistent with the original text, but in English, the \"#\" symbol is often used for hashtags or to denote sections, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the context. Since the original text appears to be a simple date heading, it may be more natural to omit the \"#\" in the English translation unless it is specifically intended to serve a particular function (e.g., as a section heading in a document).\nGiven these considerations, the most natural and fluent translation would be \"July 24th,\" as it is the standard way to write the date in English and does not include unnecessary symbols unless required by context.\n\nHKMA and the three note-issuing banks announced the launch of the 2018 New Series Hong Kong Banknotes.\n\n# October 26\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol preceding the date. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the main differences being the use of \"October 26\" versus \"October 26th\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nThe use of \"October 26\" is more common in formal writing and aligns with the style used in many official documents and calendars. \"October 26th\" is also correct but is more commonly used in informal or spoken contexts. Since the original text does not provide any context that suggests informality, \"October 26\" is the more appropriate choice.\nThe \"#\" symbol is used in the original text, and while it is not a standard part of date formatting in English, it may be used to denote a heading or section title. In this case, since the original text is simply a date, the \"#\" symbol may be redundant or unnecessary in the English translation. However, if the \"#\" symbol is intended to denote a heading or section, it should be retained in the translation.\nConsidering these factors, the best possible translation would be \"October 26\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most common and formal way to write the date in English.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and contains key terms that must be translated precisely according to the provided dictionary. The junior translators have mostly captured the essential meaning, but there are variations in fluency, grammatical structure, and the inclusion of redundant or slightly awkward phrasing.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"authorized institutions,\" \"Primary Liquidity Providers,\" and \"offshore renminbi market.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is grammatically correct and concise, but it omits \"in Hong Kong,\" which is implied in the original sentence.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"AIs\" (an abbreviation for \"authorized institutions\") and includes \"in Hong Kong,\" which is accurate but slightly redundant since the offshore renminbi market is inherently associated with Hong Kong.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"for the offshore renminbi market\" instead of \"in the offshore renminbi market,\" which is slightly less idiomatic in this context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"has designated\" instead of \"designated,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more complex than necessary for a straightforward announcement.\n- **Translation 5** is concise and accurate but omits \"in Hong Kong,\" which may be important for clarity.\n- **Translation 6** includes \"in the Hong Kong offshore renminbi market,\" which is slightly awkward phrasing compared to \"in Hong Kong's offshore renminbi market\" or \"in the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- The most natural phrasing would be to include \"in Hong Kong\" to clarify the location of the offshore renminbi market, as it is not universally known that the offshore renminbi market is based in Hong Kong.\n- The use of \"designated\" without the perfect tense (\"has designated\") is more direct and appropriate for an official announcement.\n- The phrase \"in the offshore renminbi market\" is more idiomatic than \"for the offshore renminbi market\" in this context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as Primary Liquidity Providers in Hong Kong's offshore renminbi market.\n\n# Banking System\n\n# January 10th\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward announcement regarding a policy change by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The key elements are the entity (HKMA), the policy (countercyclical capital buffer), the effective date (January 1, 2019), and the change in percentage (from 1.875% to 2.5%). All junior translators have correctly used the required terms from the dictionary: \"HKMA\" and \"countercyclical capital buffer.\"\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations are grammatically correct and convey the core message accurately.\n- The use of \"countercyclical capital buffer\" is consistent across all translations.\n- The effective date is clearly mentioned in all versions.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Tense and clarity of the announcement:** Some translations use the past tense (\"was increased,\" \"has been increased\"), while others use the future tense (\"will be increased\"). The original text uses the present tense (\"上調至\"), which implies a current policy change that is now in effect. Therefore, the most accurate tense would be the present perfect or simple present.\n- **Word choice for \"上調至\":** The translations use \"increased\" or \"raised,\" which are both acceptable, but \"raised\" may be slightly more formal and precise in this context.\n- **Clarity of the effective date:** Some translations place the effective date in a relative clause, which may slightly obscure the clarity of the announcement.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the present perfect tense (\"has been raised\") to reflect that the change is now in effect.\n- Use \"raised\" instead of \"increased\" for a more formal tone.\n- Place the effective date in a clear and direct manner to avoid ambiguity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced that the countercyclical capital buffer applicable to Hong Kong has been raised from 1.875% to 2.5%, effective from January 1, 2019.\n\n# February 2nd\nThe original text is a simple date format, \"# 2月2日\", which translates to \"February 2nd\" in English. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, with minor differences in formatting. The first junior translator used \"February 2\" without the \"nd\" suffix, which is less common in formal writing but still acceptable. The others used \"February 2nd,\" which is the more standard format in English. The use of the \"#\" symbol in the original text is likely a heading or label, and the fifth junior translator preserved it in the translation, which is appropriate if the \"#\" is meant to denote a heading or section title.\nThe best translation would be \"February 2nd\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is not a standard part of date formatting in English. However, if the \"#\" is intended to be preserved as a label or heading, then \"# February 2nd\" would be more accurate. Given the context, it is likely that the \"#\" is a heading or label, so the most appropriate translation would be \"# February 2nd.\"\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of a specific ordinance. The key term, 《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》, is correctly translated in all six versions as \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018,\" which aligns with the dictionary entry.\nHowever, the verb used to convey the action of \"刊憲\" (gazetted) varies across the translations. The most accurate and formal verb in this context is \"was gazetted,\" which is used in translations 3, 6, and 4. These versions are grammatically correct and maintain the passive voice that is typical in legal and official documents.\nTranslation 1 uses \"was published in the Gazette,\" which is also correct but slightly less formal than \"gazetted.\" Translation 2 omits the auxiliary verb \"was,\" making it grammatically incorrect. Translation 5 uses \"is gazetted,\" which implies a present state rather than a completed action, which is not appropriate for a past event. Translation 4 uses \"has been gazetted,\" which is grammatically correct but implies a more recent or ongoing action, which may not be the best fit for a formal gazetting notice.\nThe best choice is \"was gazetted,\" as it is concise, grammatically correct, and maintains the formal tone required for legal documents. It also accurately reflects the past action of gazetting the ordinance.\nBased on this review, the most appropriate translation would be:\n**The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 was gazetted.**\n\n# February 28\nThe original text is a simple date format, \"2月28日,\" which translates to \"February 28\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, with the primary difference being the use of the hashtag (#) and the inclusion of \"th\" in \"28th.\" \nThe use of the hashtag is unnecessary in this context, as it is typically used for social media tags or to denote a heading, which is not the case here. The inclusion of \"th\" is also not standard in formal or general English date formats, which typically use \"February 28\" without the ordinal suffix.\nTherefore, the most accurate and natural translation is \"February 28.\"\n\nThe original text discusses the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) peer review report on Hong Kong, highlighting progress in two key areas: reforming the over-the-counter derivative market and establishing a framework for the resolution of financial institutions. The junior translators have all correctly used the dictionary terms, which is a strong point across all translations.\nHowever, there are notable differences in the adjectives used to describe the progress made by Hong Kong. The original Chinese uses the term “進展理想,” which translates to \"ideal progress\" or \"satisfactory progress.\" The first, third, and sixth translators used \"satisfactory progress,\" which is a natural and accurate choice. The second and fourth used \"ideal progress,\" which is slightly more optimistic and less commonly used in formal reports. The fifth used \"significant progress,\" which, while accurate, shifts the emphasis slightly from the original's more neutral tone.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct and fluent. However, the use of \"recognizing\" in the fifth translation slightly changes the tone from \"confirming,\" which is more in line with the original text's formal and objective tone.\nThe best choice for the adjective is \"satisfactory progress,\" as it aligns well with the formal and measured tone of the original text. It is also the most commonly used term in official reports, making it the most appropriate choice.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"satisfactory progress\" and maintain the original structure and tone.\nThe Financial Stability Board issued a peer review report on Hong Kong, confirming that Hong Kong has made satisfactory progress in recent years in reforming the over-the-counter derivative market and establishing a framework for resolution of financial institutions.\n\n# March 23\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局促成香港銀行公會發出《無障礙銀行服務實務指引》。**\nThe dictionary provides the following translations:  \n- **金管局**: ['HKMA']  \n- **香港銀行公會**: ['Hong Kong Association of Banks', 'HKAB']  \n- **《無障礙銀行服務實務指引》**: ['Practical Guideline on Barrier-free Banking Services']\n### Review of Junior Translations:\nAll six translations correctly use the dictionary terms, with the exception of the sixth, which uses **\"urged\"** instead of **\"facilitated\"**. This is a significant deviation from the original meaning. The verb **促成** in the original sentence means \"facilitated\" or \"helped to bring about,\" not \"urged\" or \"compelled.\" Therefore, the sixth translation is inaccurate in terms of meaning and should be corrected.\nThe first five translations are nearly identical, with only minor differences in article usage. The first and fourth translations omit the article **\"The\"** before **HKMA**, which is grammatically acceptable in English when referring to an acronym, but including the article may enhance clarity and formality. The second, third, and fifth translations include **\"The\"**, which is more formal and commonly used in official or news-style writing.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are correct. However, the use of **\"facilitated the Hong Kong Association of Banks in issuing\"** is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be **\"facilitated the Hong Kong Association of Banks in issuing\"** or **\"helped the Hong Kong Association of Banks to issue\"**. The phrase **\"facilitated... in issuing\"** is grammatically correct but can be made more concise and natural.\n### Reasoning for Improvement:\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use **\"The HKMA\"** for formality and clarity.\n- Use **\"Hong Kong Association of Banks\"** as it is the full name and more formal.\n- Use **\"facilitated\"** to accurately reflect **促成**.\n- Use a more natural phrasing such as **\"to issue\"** instead of **\"in issuing\"** for smoother readability.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA facilitated the Hong Kong Association of Banks in issuing the Practical Guideline on Barrier-free Banking Services.\n\n# May 4th\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of two regulatory documents. The dictionary provides exact translations for the titles of these documents, which must be used verbatim. The junior translators have all correctly used the specified titles from the dictionary, which is a strength.\nIn terms of verb choice, \"gazetted\" is the most accurate and formal term in this context, as it refers to the official publication of legal documents in the government gazette. Translators 1, 4, and 5 used \"have been gazetted\" or \"are gazetted,\" which are appropriate for formal legal announcements. Translators 2, 3, and 6 used \"published\" or \"published in the Gazette,\" which are less precise in a legal context, as \"gazetted\" is the standard term used in legal and regulatory contexts.\nThe use of \"the\" before the titles in translations 1 and 5 adds a level of formality and accuracy, which is appropriate for legal documents. The other translations omit \"the,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal.\nTranslation 5 uses \"are gazetted,\" which is grammatically correct but less commonly used in formal legal announcements compared to the perfect tense \"have been gazetted.\" The perfect tense emphasizes the completion of the action, which is more suitable for a notice announcing the gazetting of documents.\nConsidering all these factors, the best translation would use the exact titles from the dictionary, include \"the\" before the titles for formality, and use the perfect tense \"have been gazetted\" to emphasize the completed action.\nBanking (Disclosure) (Amendment) Rules 2018 and the Banking (Specification of Multilateral Development Bank) (Amendment) Notice 2018 have been gazetted.\n\n# May 18th\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of two documents: a notice related to the commencement of the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, and the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate in terms of terminology, as they correctly use the dictionary-mandated translations for the two key terms. However, there are differences in phrasing and formality that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct and concise, but it lacks the formal tone typically expected in legal announcements. It uses \"have been published,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"gazetted\" in the context of official legal documents.\nTranslation 2 introduces \"in the Gazette,\" which is more precise and appropriate for legal terminology. However, the use of \"were published\" is slightly less formal than \"have been gazetted\" and may not fully capture the ongoing legal effect of the gazetting.\nTranslation 3 uses \"were gazetted,\" which is grammatically correct and appropriate for the context. The use of \"the\" before both documents adds a level of formality and clarity.\nTranslations 4, 5, and 6 are nearly identical, using \"have been gazetted\" and \"the\" before both documents. These translations are grammatically correct, use the appropriate legal terminology, and maintain a formal tone. However, the use of \"have been gazetted\" implies a recent action, which may not be the most neutral or formal phrasing for a legal gazette notice.\nThe best possible translation should use the formal and precise term \"gazetted\" and maintain a neutral, official tone. It should also use \"the\" before both documents to reflect their specific and named status. The use of \"have been gazetted\" is acceptable, but \"were gazetted\" may be more neutral and appropriate for a formal legal notice.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 (Commencement) Notice 2018 and the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules were gazetted.\n\n# May 30th\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在經完成公眾諮詢後發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA issued the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary term for \"金管局\" (HKMA) and \"《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本\" (Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted the word \"revised\" (修訂本), which is crucial to the meaning. The sentence implies the original guideline was issued, not the revised version.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing the public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"revised\" and uses the correct dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"the public consultation\" is slightly redundant; \"public consultation\" is a singular event, so \"the\" may be unnecessary.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing public consultations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"revised\" and uses the correct dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"public consultations\" is plural, which may not be accurate if the process was a single consultation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly includes \"revised\" and uses the correct dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the second translation, \"public consultation\" is a singular event, so \"the\" may be unnecessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"After completing the public consultation, the HKMA issued the revised version of the 'Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks.'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"revised\" and uses the correct dictionary terms. The structure is clear and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of quotation marks around the guideline title is unnecessary and may be considered stylistically inconsistent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA issued the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing the public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted \"revised,\" which is essential to the meaning of the sentence.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Include the word \"revised\" to reflect the nature of the document.\n- Use the correct dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" and \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks.\"\n- Use natural English phrasing, avoiding unnecessary articles or punctuation.\n- Reflect that the consultation was a singular event, not multiple.\n### Improved Translation:\n**HKMA issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks after completing public consultation.**\n\n# October 3rd\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在香港主辦第2屆獨立非執行董事研討會。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\nAll six translations correctly use the dictionary terms: **HKMA** for **金管局** and **Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors** for **獨立非執行董事研討會**. This is a strong point across all translations.\nHowever, there are notable differences in **grammar, fluency, and tense usage**:\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 6** use **\"hosted\"**, which is grammatically correct and appropriate for a completed event.\n- **Translation 5** uses **\"is hosting\"**, which implies the event is ongoing or happening in the present, which may not be accurate if the event has already occurred.\n- **Translations 2, 3, and 4** use **\"hosted\"** but differ in **article usage** (e.g., \"The HKMA\" vs. \"HKMA\"). While both are grammatically acceptable, including the article **\"The\"** is more natural in formal writing and aligns better with standard English conventions.\nIn terms of **fluency and naturalness**, **Translation 1** and **Translation 6** are the most polished, with correct grammar and appropriate use of articles. **Translation 2** is also very close, but the omission of \"The\" before \"HKMA\" is slightly less natural in formal contexts.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms.\n- Employ proper grammar and natural phrasing.\n- Include the article **\"The\"** before **\"HKMA\"** for formality and clarity.\n- Use the past tense **\"hosted\"** to indicate a completed event, unless the context clearly indicates the event is ongoing.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA hosted the 2nd Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 19\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, written as \"# 10月19日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first two translations use \"# October 19\", which is a direct and accurate translation, preserving the format of the original text. The third to sixth translations use \"October 19th\", which is also correct but omits the \"#\" symbol.\nThe \"#\" symbol in the original text may serve as a heading or a marker, and its inclusion or exclusion depends on the intended use of the translated text. If the \"#\" is meant to be preserved as a heading or label, then \"# October 19\" is more appropriate. However, if the \"#\" is not necessary in the English context, then \"October 19th\" is also acceptable.\nGiven the simplicity of the original text and the lack of additional context, the most neutral and accurate translation would be to preserve the format as closely as possible. Therefore, \"# October 19\" is the most appropriate translation.\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of two documents: the \"Financial Institutions (Resolution) (Loss-absorbing Capacity Requirements — Banking Sector) Rules\" (referred to as the \"LAC Rules\") and the \"Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 6) Bill 2018.\" The translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate in terms of terminology, as they correctly use the dictionary-mandated translations. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and verb choice that affect the tone and formality of the translation.\nThe verb \"gazetted\" is the most appropriate and commonly used term in legal contexts to indicate that a document has been officially published in the gazette. This is reflected in translations 2, 3, 4, and 6. However, translations 2, 3, and 4 use the present perfect tense (\"have been gazetted\"), which is more natural in English for such announcements, as it emphasizes the completed action and its relevance to the present. Translation 6 uses the simple present tense (\"are gazetted\"), which is less common and slightly less natural in this context.\nTranslation 1 and 5 use the verb \"published,\" which is less precise in a legal context. \"Published\" is a more general term and does not carry the same formal weight as \"gazetted,\" which is specifically used in legal and governmental contexts to denote official publication.\nTranslation 6 also omits the definite article \"the\" before \"Financial Institutions (Resolution)... Rules,\" which is not ideal in formal writing, as it makes the sentence slightly less precise and less natural.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use the present perfect tense with \"gazetted\" and include the definite article \"the\" for clarity and formality.\nThe final translation should be:\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) (Loss-absorbing Capacity Requirements — Banking Sector) Rules (LAC Rules) and the related Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 6) Bill 2018 have been gazetted.\n\n# October 26\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol preceding the date. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the main differences being the use of \"October 26\" versus \"October 26th\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\nThe use of \"October 26\" is more common in formal writing and aligns with the style used in many official documents and calendars. \"October 26th\" is also correct but is more commonly used in informal or spoken contexts. Since the original text does not provide any context that suggests informality, \"October 26\" is the more appropriate choice.\nThe \"#\" symbol is used in the original text, and while it is not a standard part of date formatting in English, it may be used to denote a heading or section title. In this case, since the original text is simply a date, the \"#\" symbol may be redundant or unnecessary in the English translation. However, if the \"#\" symbol is intended to denote a heading or section, it should be retained in the translation.\nConsidering these factors, the best possible translation would be \"October 26\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it is the most common and formal way to write the date in English.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement regarding a collaboration between two financial regulatory bodies. The key elements are the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the joint implementation of professional training, and mutual recognition of qualifications under a specific framework.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"implement\" and \"mutual recognition of qualifications,\" which are appropriate. The structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"promote\" instead of \"implement\" is slightly less precise in this context, as the MoU is about executing a plan, not just promoting it. However, the rest is accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, \"promote\" is used, which is slightly less precise than \"implement.\" The preposition \"within\" is slightly less natural than \"under\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is slightly off in structure. It places the framework at the end as a list, which changes the emphasis and makes the sentence less direct. The phrase \"including professional training and mutual recognition of qualifications\" is not as clear as \"under the Enhanced Competency Framework.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"have signed\" instead of \"signed.\" While grammatically correct, \"have signed\" implies a completed action with relevance to the present, which may not be necessary here.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most concise and natural version. It uses \"promote\" but in a way that is still acceptable in formal contexts. The structure is clear and the preposition \"under\" is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"implement\" to reflect the execution of the framework, as this is more precise than \"promote.\" It should also use \"under\" to indicate the framework's scope. The use of \"the\" before \"Memorandum of Understanding\" is appropriate as it refers to a specific document. The sentence should be concise and maintain the formal tone of the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly implement professional training and mutual recognition of qualifications under the Enhanced Competency Framework for Banking Practitioners.\n\n# November 16th\nThe original text is simply a date, written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese: \"# 11月16日\". The \"#\" symbol is likely used as a heading or marker, and \"11月16日\" translates directly to \"November 16th\" in English.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n- **Translation 1**: \"November 16th\" – This is correct and natural. It uses the standard English date format with the ordinal \"th\" suffix.\n- **Translation 2**: \"# November 16\" – This is also correct, but the use of \"16\" without the \"th\" suffix is less common in formal English writing. It may be acceptable in informal contexts.\n- **Translation 3**: \"# November 16\" – Same as Translation 2.\n- **Translation 4**: \"November 16th\" – Same as Translation 1.\n- **Translation 5**: \"# November 16\" – Same as Translation 2.\n- **Translation 6**: \"November 16th\" – Same as Translation 1.\nAll translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, the use of the \"#\" symbol is not standard in English date formatting. In English, it is more common to use a heading or title without a symbol unless it is part of a specific format or style guide.\nThe best translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading, but to use the standard English date format with the ordinal \"th\" suffix for clarity and formality. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is:\n**# November 16th**\n\nThe original text lists several legal documents that have been gazetted. The key task is to ensure that the specific terms from the dictionary are translated accurately and that the sentence structure is natural and fluent in English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate in terms of terminology and structure. However, it uses the passive voice (\"were published\") without specifying the context of gazetting, which is a common legal term in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions. This may be slightly less precise than using \"gazetted.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is accurate and includes the term \"in the Gazette,\" which is appropriate. However, the use of \"are published\" is less formal and less commonly used in legal contexts compared to \"gazetted.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses the term \"gazetted,\" which is the most appropriate legal term in this context. The use of \"the\" before each document is also correct and adds clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"gazetted\" correctly. However, the inclusion of \"in the Gazette\" is redundant, as \"gazetted\" already implies publication in the official gazette.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and concise translation. It uses \"gazetted\" correctly and avoids unnecessary redundancy. The structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"published\" instead of \"gazetted.\" While \"published\" is correct, \"gazetted\" is more precise in legal contexts and should be preferred.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the term \"gazetted\" to reflect the legal process of official publication. It should also be concise and avoid redundancy. The fifth junior translator's version achieves this with clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nBanking (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 (Commencement) (No. 2) Notice 2018, the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2018, and the Banking (Disclosure) (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules 2018 have been gazetted.\n\n# December 14th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, third, sixth, and fifth translators used \"December 14th\" with the \"th\" suffix, which is standard in English for dates. The second and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol in their translations, which is appropriate if the \"#\" is meant to denote a heading or section. The fourth translator used \"December 14\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is less common in formal English but still acceptable in informal contexts.\nThe best translation would be to preserve the \"#\" symbol if it is intended as a heading, and to use the \"th\" suffix for the date, as it is the most standard and formal way to write dates in English. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"# December 14th\".\n\nThe original sentence, 《吸收虧損能力規則》生效。, translates to \"The LAC Rules are in effect\" or similar variations, as per the dictionary provided. The junior translators have offered several versions of this sentence, each with slight differences in phrasing and tense.\nThe first translation, \"The LAC Rules are in effect,\" is grammatically correct and concise. It clearly conveys the current status of the rules.\nThe second translation, \"The LAC Rules are now in effect,\" adds a temporal element with \"now,\" which may be unnecessary unless the timing is important. However, it is still grammatically sound.\nThe third and fifth translations, \"LAC Rules take effect,\" are grammatically correct but slightly less natural in this context. \"Take effect\" is more commonly used with a future or scheduled action, rather than a current state.\nThe fourth translation, \"The LAC Rules come into effect,\" is also grammatically correct and natural. It is a common way to express that a rule or regulation becomes active.\nThe sixth translation, \"LAC Rules have come into effect,\" uses the present perfect tense, which is grammatically correct but slightly more complex than necessary for a simple statement of current status.\nConsidering all these options, the most natural and concise translation would be \"The LAC Rules are in effect.\" It clearly and directly communicates that the rules are currently active without unnecessary complexity or temporal emphasis.\nLAC Rules are in effect.\n\n# December 19\n\nThe HKMA has introduced supervisory measures for bank culture, namely self-assessment, thematic reviews, and bank culture dialogues, to understand the progress of the Bank Culture Reform in Hong Kong.\n\n# December 21\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or title. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translators used \"December 21\" without any additional formatting, which is a standard and natural way to express the date in English. The second and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the original text is part of a list or heading. The third translator used \"December 21st,\" which is also grammatically correct but less commonly used in formal or written English compared to \"December 21.\"\nGiven that the original text includes the \"#\" symbol, it may be appropriate to retain it in the translation to maintain the original formatting. However, in many English contexts, especially in formal writing, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used with dates unless it is part of a specific format or list.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended to be part of the heading or title, and to use \"December 21\" as the standard and most natural way to express the date in English.\n\nHKMA announced the latest list of institutions designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\nHong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\n# January 23\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, formality, and precision that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Swiss Federal Department of Finance,\" \"FINMA,\" and \"Memorandum of Understanding.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the key points about the agreements and their purposes.\n- The use of \"financial innovation\" and \"renminbi internationalisation\" is accurate and appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in phrasing:** Some translations use \"between the two sides\" while others use \"between the two regions\" or \"between the two jurisdictions.\" While all are acceptable, \"jurisdictions\" is more formal and precise in a financial context.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"Memorandum of Understanding\" or \"MoU\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n- **Formality and tone:** The original text is formal and official, so the translation should reflect that. Some translations use \"both places\" or \"both regions,\" which are less formal than \"both jurisdictions.\"\n- **Clarity of subject:** In some translations, the subject is omitted or changed (e.g., \"HKMA and Swiss Federal Department of Finance signed...\"), which can slightly alter the emphasis of the sentence.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"jurisdictions\" instead of \"regions\" or \"places\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"MoU\" after the first full mention.\n- Maintain a consistent subject (e.g., \"The HKMA signed...\") to ensure clarity and formality.\n- Ensure that the structure is parallel and that the purpose of each agreement is clearly stated.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance to strengthen financial cooperation between the two jurisdictions in areas such as renminbi internationalisation, wealth management, infrastructure financing, and international financial affairs. The HKMA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with FINMA to promote financial innovation between the two jurisdictions.\n\n# January 31\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme,\" \"fintech talent pool,\" and \"FCAS 2.0.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"aiming to strengthen the development of...\" or \"aiming to enhance the development of...\" is appropriate and conveys the intended purpose of the program.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** uses \"cultivation\" instead of \"development,\" which is less common in formal or professional contexts when referring to talent development.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"local fintech talent pool,\" which is slightly redundant since the context already implies Hong Kong.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the ideal version, but the placement of \"in Hong Kong\" after \"fintech talent pool\" is slightly awkward compared to placing it before the noun for clarity.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"the development of Hong Kong's fintech talent pool,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise than placing \"in Hong Kong\" after the noun.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"development\" rather than \"cultivation\" for consistency with professional terminology.\n- Place \"in Hong Kong\" before \"fintech talent pool\" for clarity and natural flow.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"to meet the industry's growing demand\" is used consistently, as it is the most natural and commonly used expression in such contexts.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has launched the upgraded version of the \"Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme\" (FCAS 2.0), aiming to strengthen the development of the fintech talent pool in Hong Kong to meet the industry's growing demand.\n\n# March 9\n\nHKMA and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding to promote fintech collaboration.\n\n# March 27-28\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about a collaborative event organized by several institutions. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the organizations and the event details. The dictionary provides exact translations for these terms, and the junior translators mostly adhere to them, though with varying degrees of fluency and clarity.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"co-organized\" and \"administrative personnel\" appropriately. However, it omits the full name \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" after \"IFFO,\" which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is concise but lacks clarity in the structure. The phrase \"co-organizes a two-day workshop\" is grammatically correct but feels abrupt. Also, it omits the full name of IFFO after the acronym, which may confuse readers.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes the full name of IFFO. However, it uses \"executive workshop\" instead of \"administrative personnel,\" which may misrepresent the intended audience. The term \"executive\" implies a higher-level audience than \"administrative personnel.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is overly simplistic and lacks clarity. It lists all entities as if they are all equal participants, which is not accurate. The phrase \"jointly organized\" is vague and does not clearly indicate the role of IFFO.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is the most comprehensive and accurate. It includes the full name of IFFO, uses \"co-organized,\" and correctly identifies the audience as \"administrative staff.\" It also provides the full name of HKMA, which adds clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"co-hosted\" and \"administrative staff\" appropriately. However, it omits the full name of IFFO after the acronym, which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should include the full name of IFFO after the acronym, use \"co-organized\" or \"co-hosted\" to reflect collaboration, and accurately identify the audience as \"administrative personnel\" or \"administrative staff.\" It should also clearly indicate that IFFO is part of the HKMA.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, co-organized a two-day workshop for administrative personnel.\n\n# May 15th\n\nIFFO與香港銀行公會合辦「建設可持續發展的一帶一路：香港的關鍵角色」研討會。\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but exhibit some minor issues in fluency, grammar, and word choice. The term \"研討會\" is consistently translated as \"conference activities,\" which is not idiomatic in English. A more natural translation would be \"seminar\" or \"conference.\" Additionally, the verb \"合辦\" is translated in various ways, including \"jointly held,\" \"co-hosted,\" \"co-organized,\" and \"jointly organized.\" While all are grammatically correct, \"co-hosted\" is the most natural and commonly used term in this context.\nThe phrase \"on 'Building a Sustainable Belt and Road: Hong Kong's Key Role'\" is slightly awkward. A more fluent structure would be \"titled 'Building a Sustainable Belt and Road: Hong Kong's Key Role.'\" Also, the use of \"a conference activities\" is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"a conference\" or \"conference activities\" (though the latter is not idiomatic).\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"co-hosted,\" \"conference,\" and \"titled\" to produce a fluent and natural-sounding sentence.\nIFFO and the Hong Kong Association of Banks co-hosted the conference titled \"Building a Sustainable Belt and Road: Hong Kong's Key Role.\"\n\n# May 29\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but exhibit several issues in terms of fluency, grammar, and consistency with the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for \"金管局\" (HKMA), \"投資推廣署\" (Invest Hong Kong), and \"財資管理\" (Corporate Treasury Management). However, the term \"研討會\" is listed as \"conference activities\" in the dictionary, but in the translations, it is inconsistently rendered as \"conference activities\" (plural) or \"conference\" (singular). Since the dictionary specifies \"conference activities,\" the plural form should be used.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Several translations use \"conference activities\" incorrectly as a singular noun. For example, \"held a conference activities\" is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrasing should be \"held conference activities\" or \"organized a conference activity.\"\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness and Nuance**: The term \"粵港澳大灣區\" is translated in multiple ways. While all options are acceptable, \"Greater Bay Area\" is the most commonly used and internationally recognized term. Using \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\" is more specific but less commonly used in international contexts. Given the context of an international conference, \"Greater Bay Area\" is more appropriate.\n4. **Consistency**: The translations vary in structure and phrasing. For example, \"jointly held,\" \"co-hosted,\" and \"co-organized\" are all acceptable, but \"co-hosted\" is the most natural and commonly used term in this context.\n5. **Punctuation and Formatting**: Some translations use a bullet point or incorrect punctuation (e.g., “•” vs. “-”). The use of “•” is acceptable, but consistency in punctuation is important for readability.\n**Improved Translation**:\nHKMA and Invest Hong Kong co-hosted conference activities in Guangzhou with the theme \"Greater Bay Area • New Opportunities in Overseas Corporate Treasury Management.\"\n\n# June 14\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, stating that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) jointly hosted an event in Hong Kong related to the \"Green and Social Bond Principles\" in 2018. The dictionary provides exact translations for key terms, which must be used as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"jointly hosted\" and correctly places the event name in quotes. However, \"Annual Members' Meeting and Conference\" is slightly redundant, as \"conference\" often includes meetings.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very close to the first, but it combines the event name with the event type, which may be less clear. It also omits the word \"annual\" before \"Members' Meeting and Conference,\" which is important for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"Annual General Meeting\" instead of \"Annual Members' Meeting,\" which is a slight deviation. \"Annual General Meeting\" is typically used for shareholder meetings, not for membership-based organizations like ICMA.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is awkward due to the repetition of \"Conference and Meetings\" and the placement of the year. It also omits the word \"annual\" before \"Members' Meeting.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct and clear. It places the event name in quotes and uses \"annual member meeting and conference,\" which is natural. However, it omits the year \"2018\" from the event name, which is important for specificity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very similar to the second, but it repeats \"Conference and Meetings\" and omits the word \"annual\" before \"Members' Meeting.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact terms from the dictionary: \"Green and Social Bond Principles\" and \"International Capital Market Association.\"\n- Include the year \"2018\" in the event name for clarity.\n- Use \"Annual Members' Meeting and Conference\" to reflect the event's nature.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- Ensure the sentence flows naturally in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the International Capital Market Association co-hosted the \"2018 Green and Social Bond Principles Annual Members' Meeting and Conference\" in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 15th\n# 6月15日\nThe original text is a simple date written in Traditional Chinese. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, second, fifth, and sixth translators used \"June 15th\" as their translation. This is the most natural and commonly used format in English for dates, especially in formal or written contexts. The use of \"th\" is appropriate for the 15th day of the month.\nThe fourth and sixth translators used \"# June 15\" as their translation. The use of the hashtag \"#\" is not standard in English date formatting and may be confusing or unnecessary in this context. Additionally, the omission of \"th\" in \"15\" is less formal and may not be appropriate for all contexts.\nGiven the simplicity of the original text, the best possible translation would be \"June 15th,\" as it is the most natural and commonly used format in English for dates. It is also the most consistent with the translations provided by the majority of the junior translators.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）研究局在香港合辦「內地與香港綠色金融合作研討會。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Research Bureau of the People’s Bank of China.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"conference activities\" is awkward and redundant. \"Co-hosted\" is correct, but the phrase \"Mainland and Hong Kong Green Finance conference activities\" is not idiomatic.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"conference activities\" is not standard in English for such events.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"co-hosted\" and includes \"Cooperation\" in the title, which adds clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Conference Activities\" is still awkward and redundant. The title is overly long and not natural in English.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The title is more formal than necessary and lacks fluency.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Research Bureau of the People’s Bank of China.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same issue as the first translation with \"conference activities.\" The title is not idiomatic.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The phrase \"conference activities\" is not standard in English for such events.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"conference activities\" but rephrases the title to \"Cooperation in Green Finance between the Mainland and Hong Kong,\" which is more natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Conference activities\" is still not ideal. The structure is slightly awkward.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The title is more natural, but the phrase \"conference activities\" is still not standard.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Conference Activities on Green Finance Cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong,\" which is more natural than previous versions.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Conference Activities\" is still not ideal. The use of \"jointly organized\" is slightly less common than \"co-hosted.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The title is more natural, but the phrase \"conference activities\" is still not standard.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Conference on Green Finance Cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong,\" which is natural and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Conference\" is more appropriate than \"conference activities.\" The use of \"hosted\" is slightly less common than \"co-hosted.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The title is natural and concise, and the structure is fluent.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" and \"Research Bureau of the People’s Bank of China\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"co-hosted\" as it is the most natural term for this context.\n- Replace \"研討會\" with \"conference\" rather than \"conference activities,\" as the latter is not standard in English.\n- Use \"Green Finance\" with a capital \"F\" as it is a proper noun in this context.\n- Use \"Mainland\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure the title is concise and natural: \"Conference on Green Finance Cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA and the Research Bureau of the People’s Bank of China co-hosted the \"Conference on Green Finance Cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong\" in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 25th\n# 6月25日\nThe original text is a simple date written in Traditional Chinese. The junior translators have all provided translations that are grammatically correct and fluent in English. The only variation among the translations is the presence of the \"#\" symbol, which appears in translations 2 and 6. This symbol is not present in the original text and does not serve a clear purpose in the translation, so it is best omitted for accuracy and clarity.\nThe translations are all accurate and natural, with no need for significant changes. The date \"6月25日\" is correctly translated as \"June 25th\" in all cases. Since the dictionary is empty, there are no specific terms that need to be translated using predefined alternatives.\nGiven the simplicity of the original text and the consistency of the translations, the best possible translation is simply \"June 25th.\"\n\nHKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service of the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality have launched the inaugural “Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme” for Hong Kong tertiary students.\n\n# June 26\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a news headline or official statement. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in style, grammar, and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market,\" \"Co-operation Agreement,\" and \"fintech collaboration.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is mostly accurate, with the subject (HKMA and the regulatory authority), the action (signed), and the purpose (to strengthen fintech collaboration) all present.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** The first, second, and third translations are very similar, with the only difference being the use of \"the\" before \"HKMA\" (first and second translations) and its absence in the third. While \"HKMA\" is an acronym and typically does not require \"the,\" in formal contexts, it may be used with \"the\" depending on style. However, the third translation is slightly more concise.\n- **Punctuation and Clarity:** The fourth translation uses a comma to separate the signing of the agreement from the result, which is grammatically acceptable but slightly less direct than using \"to strengthen\" as a purpose clause.\n- **Word Choice:** The fifth and sixth translations use \"between the two parties\" and \"between the two sides,\" which are both acceptable but slightly more verbose than necessary. \"Between the two\" would be more concise and natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"the\" before \"HKMA\" for consistency with formal writing, though it is not strictly required.\n- Use \"a\" before \"Co-operation Agreement\" to reflect that it is one of many such agreements.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"between the two\" instead of \"between the two parties\" or \"between the two sides.\"\n- Ensure the sentence flows smoothly and is grammatically correct.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market signed a Co-operation Agreement to strengthen their fintech collaboration.\n\n# June 27\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about a joint publication by two regulatory bodies regarding improvements to the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives. The translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in verb tense and preposition usage.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Securities and Futures Commission,\" and \"over-the-counter derivatives regulatory regime.\"\n- Proper structure and clarity in conveying the joint publication and its purpose.\n- Consistent use of formal language appropriate for regulatory announcements.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Verb tense: Some translations use the present perfect (\"have issued\/published\"), while others use the simple past (\"issued\"). The original text uses the present perfect in Chinese, which implies the action has been completed and is relevant to the present. However, in formal English regulatory statements, the simple past is often preferred for such announcements.\n- Preposition usage: \"on\" vs. \"regarding\" – both are acceptable, but \"on\" is more direct and commonly used in such contexts.\n- Redundancy: Translations 3 and 4 are identical, which may indicate a lack of originality or oversight in the translation process.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would use the simple past tense, the preposition \"on,\" and maintain a clear, formal tone.\nFinal Translation:\nThe HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission issued a joint consultation summary document on further improvements to the over-the-counter derivatives regulatory regime.\n\n# June 28th\n# 6月28日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, where the \"#\" symbol is often used to denote a heading or section title. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with most opting for \"June 28th\" and a couple including the \"#\" symbol as well.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"June 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately translates the date.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be important for formatting or context.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# June 28\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains the \"#\" symbol, preserving the original formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"June 28\" instead of \"June 28th,\" which is less formal and may not match the tone of the original.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"June 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation, accurate and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first, omits the \"#\" symbol.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"June 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first and third, accurate and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first, omits the \"#\" symbol.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"June 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first, third, and fourth, accurate and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first, omits the \"#\" symbol.  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# June 28\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second, retains the \"#\" symbol.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"June 28\" instead of \"June 28th,\" which is less formal and may not match the tone of the original.  \n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe original text includes the \"#\" symbol, which is often used in Chinese to denote a heading or section. Therefore, it is important to preserve this symbol in the translation to maintain the intended formatting. Additionally, the use of \"June 28th\" is more formal and aligns with standard English date formatting, especially in written or official contexts. \n**Improved Translation:**\n# June 28th\n\nIFFO hosted a panel discussion on \"Risk Mitigation in Infrastructure Financing\" during the 3rd Belt and Road Summit.\n\n# July 3rd\n\n「債券通」開通一周年。\nThe original text is a concise headline announcing the one-year anniversary of the launch of \"Bond Connect.\" The dictionary specifies that \"債券通\" must be translated as \"Bond Connect,\" which is a proper noun and should remain capitalized.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** *\"Bond Connect has been operational for one year.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and clear. It conveys the passage of time and the status of Bond Connect.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more formal than the original, which is a headline. It may not capture the celebratory tone of an anniversary.\n2. **Translation 2:** *\"Bond Connect has been operational for one year.\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 1.**\n3. **Translation 3:** *\"Bond Connect's One-Year Anniversary.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Captures the anniversary aspect directly and is concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** It is a title-like phrase rather than a full sentence, which may not be suitable for a news headline or general statement.\n4. **Translation 4:** *\"Bond Connect marks its first anniversary.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and natural-sounding. It conveys the anniversary in a more dynamic and celebratory tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than necessary for a headline.\n5. **Translation 5:** *\"Bond Connect marks its first anniversary.\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 4.**\n6. **Translation 6:** *'\"Bond Connect\" has been operational for one year.'*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and clear. The quotation marks are unnecessary but do not affect the meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The quotation marks may be distracting and are not typically used in headlines.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe original text is a headline, so it should be concise, clear, and slightly celebratory. While \"Bond Connect has been operational for one year\" is accurate, it lacks the celebratory tone of an anniversary. \"Bond Connect marks its first anniversary\" is more dynamic and appropriate for a headline. However, it is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nA balanced approach would be to use a concise structure that reflects both the passage of time and the significance of the anniversary. The phrase \"Bond Connect turns one year old\" is natural, concise, and captures the celebratory tone. However, since the dictionary specifies \"Bond Connect\" as the only acceptable translation, we must use that exact term.\n**Improved Translation:**\nBond Connect marks its first anniversary.\n\n# July 18\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format \"# 7月18日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the date in English. The first, sixth, and fourth translations use \"July 18\" without the \"th\" suffix, while the second and third use \"July 18th\". The fourth and fifth translations also include the \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original text.\nThe use of \"July 18\" is more common in formal writing and is considered more natural in English. The \"th\" suffix is typically used in informal or spoken contexts. Since the original text does not include the \"th\" suffix, it is more appropriate to follow suit in the translation.\nThe \"#\" symbol is used in the original text, but it is not clear what its purpose is. It could be a heading or a marker. In English, it is common to use \"#\" as a hashtag or to denote a section heading. However, since the original text is simply a date, it is more natural to omit the \"#\" symbol in the translation unless it is clear that it serves a specific function.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original text is \"July 18\".\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局發布香港銀行業「開放應用程式界面」（開放API）框架。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA released the 'Open API' (Open APIs) framework for the banking sector in Hong Kong.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"banking sector\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"in Hong Kong\" is redundant since \"banking sector\" is already specified as \"Hong Kong's banking sector\" in other translations. Also, the use of both \"Open API\" and \"Open APIs\" in parentheses is inconsistent and unnecessary.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA releases the 'Open Application Programming Interface' (Open API) framework for Hong Kong's banking sector.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Open Application Programming Interface\" as a full form of \"Open API,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The verb \"releases\" is in present tense, which may not match the original's past tense \"發布.\" Also, the phrase \"for Hong Kong's banking sector\" is slightly wordy.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA releases the 'Open Application Programming Interface' (Open API) framework for Hong Kong's banking sector.\"*  \n   - **Same as Translation 2.** Identical to the second translation, so same evaluation applies.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA releases the 'Open Application Programming Interface' (Open API) framework for the banking sector.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct terminology and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitting \"Hong Kong's\" may be acceptable, but it's slightly less specific than including it.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has released a framework for the banking sector’s Open APIs.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"has released\" for present perfect tense, which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"banking sector’s Open APIs\" is awkward and less direct than \"Open APIs framework for the banking sector.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has issued the framework for 'Open APIs' in the Hong Kong banking sector.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"issued\" as a synonym for \"released,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"in the Hong Kong banking sector\" is slightly awkward compared to \"for the Hong Kong banking sector.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"banking sector\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Open API\" or \"Open APIs\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use the correct verb tense (\"released\" or \"has released\").\n- Be concise and natural in English.\n### Improved Translation:\n**HKMA has released the Open API framework for the Hong Kong banking sector.**\n\n# August 7th\n# 8月7日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate, though there are minor differences in formatting.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"August 7th\"** – This is correct and natural in English. It uses the ordinal form \"7th\" which is appropriate for dates in English.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"August 7th\"** – Same as the first, and equally correct.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"August 7th\"** – Again, identical to the first two, and accurate.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# August 7\"** – This is slightly less natural due to the use of the hashtag symbol \"#\", which is not typically used in formal date formatting in English. The use of \"7\" instead of \"7th\" is also less standard for dates.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# August 7th\"** – This is similar to the fourth, but uses the ordinal form \"7th\" which is better. However, the hashtag is still unnecessary and may be considered informal or out of place in this context.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"August 7th\"** – This is the most straightforward and natural translation, matching the first three.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe most natural and standard English format for the date \"8月7日\" is \"August 7th.\" The use of the ordinal form \"7th\" is appropriate in English for dates, and the absence of any unnecessary symbols like the hashtag makes the translation cleaner and more formal. Since there is no dictionary provided that requires specific translations for any terms, the translation should remain as simple and direct as possible.\n**Final Translation:**\nAugust 7th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting an official announcement. The key terms \"金管局\" and \"全球金融創新網絡\" must be translated exactly as specified in the dictionary: \"HKMA\" and \"Global Financial Innovation Network,\" respectively.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"plan\" for \"計劃,\" which is appropriate. However, the use of \"the\" before \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" is unnecessary and slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate. It uses \"initiative\" instead of \"plan,\" which is a valid synonym. The use of \"agencies\" instead of \"institutions\" is slightly less precise, but still acceptable. The quotation marks are correctly used.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the second, but uses \"institutions\" instead of \"agencies,\" which is more precise. It also uses \"initiative\" instead of \"plan,\" which is acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is well-structured and natural. It uses \"together with\" and \"relevant institutions,\" which are appropriate. The quotation marks and \"initiative\" are well-chosen.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is accurate and natural. It uses \"along with\" and \"plan,\" which are both appropriate. The quotation marks are correctly used.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is very similar to the fifth, but uses \"together with\" and single quotation marks. The use of single quotation marks is less standard in formal writing, though not incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and use standard quotation marks. \"Initiative\" and \"plan\" are both acceptable, but \"initiative\" may be more appropriate in the context of a formal program or network. \"Institutions\" is more precise than \"agencies.\" The phrase \"together with\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for an official announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, together with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions, announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" initiative.\n\n# August 15-16\n\nHKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council co-hosted the \"Connecting the Belt and Road, Jointly Expanding Development Opportunities\" High-level Roundtable in Hong Kong.\n\n# August 24\n\nBond Connect has fully implemented the Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement model.\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, typical of financial or regulatory announcements. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are variations in word choice and structure that affect fluency and precision.\nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct but lacks the definite article \"the\" before \"Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement,\" which is standard in formal English when referring to specific systems or models.\nTranslation 2 uses \"comprehensively implements\" instead of \"has fully implemented.\" While both are correct, \"has fully implemented\" is more direct and aligns better with the original Chinese structure, which emphasizes the completion of the implementation.\nTranslation 3 uses \"mode\" instead of \"model.\" While both terms are similar, \"model\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to describe a system or method of operation, making it a more appropriate choice.\nTranslation 4 correctly uses \"the\" and \"model,\" but adds quotation marks around \"Bond Connect,\" which is unnecessary unless the term is being introduced or emphasized in a specific way.\nTranslation 5 omits \"the\" before \"settlement,\" which, while not strictly incorrect, is less formal and less precise than including it.\nTranslation 6 incorrectly uses \"will fully implement\" instead of \"has fully implemented,\" which changes the tense and implies a future action rather than a completed one. This is a significant deviation from the original meaning.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should use \"has fully implemented,\" include \"the\" before \"Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement model,\" and avoid unnecessary punctuation or word choice that alters the original meaning or tone. The most accurate and fluent translation is:\nBond Connect has fully implemented the Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement model.\n\n# August 31st\n\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, stating that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has designated two retail payment systems under a specific piece of legislation. The junior translators have mostly captured the meaning accurately, but there are minor differences in tense and completeness.\n**Review of Translations:**\n- **Translation 1:** \"The HKMA has designated two retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 584).\"  \n  This translation is accurate and complete. It uses the present perfect tense (\"has designated\"), which is appropriate for actions with relevance to the present. It also includes the full name of the ordinance and its chapter reference.\n- **Translation 2:** \"The HKMA designated two retail payment systems under Cap. 584.\"  \n  This translation is grammatically correct but lacks the full name of the ordinance. While \"Cap. 584\" is acceptable in legal contexts, it is better to include the full title for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the reference.\n- **Translation 3:** Identical to Translation 1. It is accurate and well-structured.\n- **Translation 4:** Identical to Translation 2. It is grammatically correct but lacks the full name of the ordinance.\n- **Translation 5:** Identical to Translation 1. It is accurate and well-structured.\n- **Translation 6:** Identical to Translation 5. It is accurate and well-structured.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nAll translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, the use of the present perfect tense (\"has designated\") in Translations 1, 3, 5, and 6 is more appropriate in this context, as it emphasizes the ongoing relevance of the designation. Additionally, including the full name of the ordinance (\"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\") alongside the chapter reference (\"Cap. 584\") enhances clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has designated two retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 584).\n\n# September 9th\n\nHKMA and the Central Bank of Brazil signed a Co-operation Agreement to promote cooperation between the two central banks on fintech matters.\n\n# September 17\n\nThe original text states that the HKMA announced the launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS,\" which became fully operational on September 30. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is concise but omits the second sentence about the system becoming fully operational. It also uses \"on September 30\" without specifying whether the date refers to the launch or the full operation.\nTranslation 2 is more complete, including both the launch and the full operational date. However, it uses \"will be fully operational,\" which implies a future action, whereas the original text indicates that the system was already fully operational on that date.\nTranslation 3 uses \"was fully activated,\" which is slightly less precise than \"fully operational.\" It also uses \"on September 30,\" which is correct but could be more clearly linked to the system's activation.\nTranslation 4 uses \"from September 30th,\" which is slightly less precise than \"on September 30.\" It also omits the word \"the\" before \"Faster Payment System.\"\nTranslation 5 is very similar to Translation 3, using \"was fully activated\" and \"on September 30.\" It is accurate but slightly less natural than \"fully operational.\"\nTranslation 6 is the most accurate and natural, using \"fully operational\" and \"on September 30.\" It also includes both sentences from the original text and uses proper grammar and punctuation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would include both sentences from the original text, use \"fully operational\" to describe the system's status on September 30, and ensure that the date is clearly linked to the system's activation. It should also use proper grammar and punctuation, and include the word \"the\" before \"Faster Payment System.\"\nHKMA announced the launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS.\" The system was fully operational on September 30.\n\n# September 20th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 9月20日\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the English translation. The first, third, and sixth translators used \"September 20th,\" which is grammatically correct and commonly used in English for dates. The second, fourth, and fifth translators used \"# September 20,\" which is also acceptable, though the use of the hash symbol (#) is less common in English date formats unless it is part of a specific context or heading.\nThe most natural and widely accepted format in English is \"September 20th,\" which includes the ordinal indicator \"th\" to denote the 20th day of the month. This format is consistent with standard English conventions for writing dates. Therefore, \"September 20th\" is the most appropriate translation for the given text.\n\nHKMA and the People’s Bank of China signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the use of the Central Moneymarkets Unit for the issuance of PBoC Bills.\n\n# September 21st\n\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, stating that the \"2018 Treasury Markets Summit\" was held in Hong Kong and was co-hosted by the HKMA and the Treasury Markets Association. The junior translators have all captured the essential information accurately, and all translations are grammatically correct and fluent. However, there are minor differences in phrasing and punctuation that can be refined for clarity and consistency.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Treasury Markets Association,\" and \"Treasury Markets Summit.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, with only slight variations in prepositions and phrasing.\n- The use of quotation marks around the event name is consistent in most translations, with only minor differences in punctuation (e.g., straight vs. curly quotes).\nWeaknesses:\n- The first translation uses \"Hosted by\" instead of \"co-hosted by,\" which slightly changes the nuance by implying one party was the primary host.\n- The third translation uses \"co-organized by\" instead of \"co-hosted by,\" which is slightly less precise in this context, as the event was co-hosted, not co-organized.\n- The use of straight quotes (\") in the first translation is less common in formal writing compared to curly quotes (“”), though this is a minor stylistic choice.\nImprovements:\n- Use \"co-hosted by\" to accurately reflect the joint hosting of the event.\n- Use curly quotes (“”) for the event name to maintain a more formal and polished appearance.\n- Ensure consistency in prepositions and phrasing across the translation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"co-hosted by,\" include the event name in curly quotes, and maintain a clear and formal tone.\nThe 2018 Treasury Markets Summit, co-hosted by the HKMA and the Treasury Markets Association, was held in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 25-26\n\nIFFO hosted its 2nd \"Investors and Debt Financing Roundtables\" and also announced the addition of five new institutions as IFFO partners, bringing the total to 95.\n\n# October 31st\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and emphasis that affect readability and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"eTradeConnect,\" \"trade finance platform,\" \"consortium of banks,\" and \"HKMA.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information (the launch of eTradeConnect, its blockchain basis, and the involvement of 12 major Hong Kong banks) is preserved in all versions.\n- The use of \"jointly developed\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"a blockchain-based trade finance platform\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluid than alternatives.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"developed by a consortium of banks comprising 12 major banks in Hong Kong,\" which is slightly redundant and less concise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"built on blockchain,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"based on blockchain technology.\"\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal version, with a natural flow and clear structure.\n- **Translation 5** places \"built on blockchain technology\" at the end, which slightly disrupts the flow compared to placing it closer to the platform description.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"built on blockchain and jointly developed,\" which is slightly awkward in structure and less clear than using \"based on blockchain technology\" and \"jointly developed\" in sequence.\n**Improvements:**\n- The phrase \"based on blockchain technology\" is more natural and commonly used in formal English than \"built on blockchain.\"\n- The placement of \"jointly developed by a consortium of 12 major Hong Kong banks\" should follow the description of the platform to maintain clarity and flow.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"a consortium of banks comprising 12 major banks,\" which can be simplified to \"a consortium of 12 major Hong Kong banks.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the official launch of eTradeConnect. This is a trade finance platform based on blockchain technology, jointly developed by a consortium of 12 major Hong Kong banks.\n\nHKMA witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the operators of eTradeConnect and the European we.trade platforms to launch a new proof of concept, connecting the two platforms.\n\n# October 31 to November 15\nThe original text is a simple date range, and the translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate. However, there are a few minor issues to consider.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"October 31\" and \"November 15\" without the \"st\" suffix, which is acceptable in formal writing. The second and third translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is not necessary in this context and may be a formatting error. The fifth translation uses \"From October 31 to November 15,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary but still correct.\nThe best translation would be concise and clear, without unnecessary symbols or verbosity. Therefore, \"October 31 to November 15\" is the most appropriate translation.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing on-site arrangements for a mutual evaluation conducted by two international organizations: the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). The evaluation aims to assess the effectiveness of Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime.\nAll six translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a strong point. However, there are differences in phrasing and grammatical structure that affect fluency and clarity.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and fluent, using \"provides on-site inspection arrangements\" and \"jointly conducted by\" to clearly convey the collaborative nature of the evaluation. It uses \"examines\" for the evaluation, which is appropriate.\nTranslation 2 uses \"has provided\" which implies a completed action, but the original text does not specify a time frame, so \"provides\" is more neutral and accurate. It also uses \"assessment\" instead of \"evaluation,\" which is slightly different in nuance but still acceptable.\nTranslation 3 and 6 use \"on Hong Kong\" instead of \"of Hong Kong,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context. The evaluation is of Hong Kong, not on it.\nTranslation 4 is identical to 3, so it suffers from the same issue.\nTranslation 5 uses \"is providing,\" which implies an ongoing action, which may be appropriate if the evaluation is currently taking place. However, the original text does not specify the timing, so \"provides\" is more neutral.\nThe best translation would use \"provides on-site inspection arrangements\" to match the original's neutral tone, \"jointly conducted by\" to emphasize the collaboration, and \"examines\" to reflect the purpose of the evaluation. It should also use \"of Hong Kong\" to maintain grammatical accuracy.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe HKMA provides on-site inspection arrangements for the mutual evaluation jointly conducted by the Financial Action Task Force and the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering of Hong Kong. This evaluation examines the effectiveness of Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime.\n\n# December 12th is the most appropriate format for translating \"12月12日\" into English. It correctly uses the ordinal form \"12th\" to denote the specific day of the month, which is standard in English date formatting. The use of the \"#\" symbol in translations 1 and 4 is unnecessary and does not appear in the original text, so it should be omitted. Translations 3 and 6 use \"December 12\" without the ordinal form, which is less precise in formal or written contexts. Translation 5 is correct but duplicates the format of translation 1 without the unnecessary \"#\".\nDecember 12th\nDecember 12th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of appropriate terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"noting that\" and \"praising\" effectively. However, \"buffer against challenges\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"buffer to cope with challenges\" or \"buffer space to address challenges.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very strong. It uses \"significant buffers to address challenges,\" which is more natural than \"buffer against challenges.\" The use of \"reaffirming\" is appropriate and consistent with the tone of the original.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. The phrase \"implemented over the years\" adds clarity. However, \"preliminary conclusions\" is not the exact term used in the original, which refers to a \"Concluding Statement.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and uses \"buffer space to cope with challenges,\" which is natural. The use of \"commended\" is slightly more formal than \"praised\" or \"reaffirming,\" but still appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has a minor grammatical issue: \"reaffirmed its support\" should be \"reaffirming its support\" to maintain parallel structure with the preceding verb \"praised.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"territory\" instead of \"region,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\" The use of \"commending\" is appropriate, though \"praised\" might be more consistent with the tone of the original.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"Concluding Statement for the 2018 Article IV Consultation\" should be used exactly as in the dictionary.\n- \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" should be used in full, as it is a formal designation.\n- \"Macro-economic policies\" is the correct term from the dictionary.\n- \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" is the preferred term from the dictionary, though \"LERS\" is also acceptable in technical contexts.\n- The phrase \"strong buffer space to address challenges\" is more natural and idiomatic than \"buffer against challenges.\"\n- The verb \"praised\" is more consistent with the tone of the original than \"commended\" or \"reaffirming.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe International Monetary Fund released a Concluding Statement for the 2018 Article IV Consultation regarding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, noting that Hong Kong's long-standing prudent macro-economic policies have provided the region with strong buffer space to address challenges, and praised Hong Kong's maintenance of prudent financial regulation and supervision, as well as reaffirming its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n"}
{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" \"Linked Exchange Rate System,\" \"currency stability,\" \"financial infrastructure,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" However, there are subtle variations in the use of terms like \"banking system\" versus \"banking sector\" and \"International Financial Centre\" versus \"international financial centre.\"\nThe first, second, third, fifth, and sixth translations are very similar, with only slight differences in prepositions (e.g., \"within the framework of\" vs. \"under\") and the use of \"status\" vs. \"position\" when referring to Hong Kong's role as an international financial center. The fourth translation introduces the acronym \"LERS\" and \"IFC\" in parentheses, which may be unnecessary unless the text is intended for an audience familiar with these acronyms.\nIn terms of fluency and natural English expression, all translations are acceptable, but the second and sixth translations are slightly more concise and natural in their phrasing. The use of \"consolidating\" in the second and sixth translations is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"reinforcing\" or \"strengthening.\" Additionally, the second and sixth translations use \"Hong Kong’s\" consistently, which is more natural in English than \"Hong Kong's\" with an apostrophe.\nThe best possible translation would retain the clarity and formality of the original text while ensuring natural English phrasing and consistent use of terms. It should use \"consolidating\" for \"鞏固,\" \"financial system\" and \"banking system\" as per the dictionary, and \"International Financial Centre\" as the preferred term for \"國際金融中心.\"\nFinal Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution, with four core activities: maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an International Financial Centre, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA's Statutory Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Assembly) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Commissioner) to appoint the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to ensure consistency, clarity, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA website\" and the names of the ordinances.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, and the meaning is clearly conveyed.\n- The use of terms like \"explicitly stipulated,\" \"sets out,\" and \"discloses\" is appropriate and reflects the formal tone of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may cause ambiguity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the context.\n- The phrase \"mutual letter exchanged\" or \"exchange of letters\" is used in some translations, but \"exchange of letters\" is more standard in formal contexts.\n- The term \"discloses\" is used in several translations, but \"details\" or \"sets out\" may be more precise in the context of outlining responsibilities.\n- The phrase \"in matters of money and finance\" in one translation is slightly less formal than \"in monetary and financial matters,\" which is more commonly used in legal or regulatory contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently to avoid ambiguity.\n- Use \"exchange of letters\" as the standard term for formal correspondence.\n- Use \"details\" or \"sets out\" to describe the allocation of functions and responsibilities.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"monetary and financial matters\" is used consistently for clarity and formality.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, use \"exchange of letters\" as the standard term, and ensure that the language is formal and precise.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are explicitly stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, Banking Ordinance, Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, sets out the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also details that the Financial Secretary delegated certain powers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The letter is a public document and can be accessed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" and \"Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, formality, and precision that can be refined for optimal clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\n- The use of the dictionary terms is consistent and correct across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and maintain a formal tone appropriate for legal or policy-related content.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"the financial system in Hong Kong\" or \"Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system,\" which is slightly redundant or less concise than \"Hong Kong’s financial system.\"\n- The phrase \"preserve Hong Kong as an international financial centre\" is slightly less natural than \"maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre\" or \"preserve Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.\"\n- The use of \"utilize\" in some translations is slightly more formal than necessary, while \"use\" is more commonly used in such contexts.\n- The phrase \"with control vested in the Financial Secretary\" is slightly more formal and legalistic than \"is under the control of the Financial Secretary,\" which may be more natural in general English usage.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"maintain\" instead of \"preserve\" for consistency with the original Chinese, which uses the verb \"保持.\"\n- Use \"financial system\" rather than \"monetary and financial system\" unless the original explicitly refers to both.\n- Use \"use\" instead of \"utilize\" for a more natural tone.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"Hong Kong as an international financial centre\" is used exactly as in the dictionary, without adding possessive forms like \"Hong Kong’s.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, with control vested in the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund must primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"Monetary Authority\" consistently, which is acceptable, but the phrase \"the functions conferred upon him under that Ordinance, as well as the functions assigned by other Ordinances and by the Financial Secretary\" is slightly awkward and repetitive. Also, \"the office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA\" is slightly unclear in structure.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"HKMA Chief Executive\" correctly. The sentence structure is more fluent, but \"exercising other functions prescribed by the Ordinance and the Financial Secretary\" is slightly ambiguous, as it could be interpreted as the Ordinance prescribing functions alongside the Financial Secretary.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"HKMA Chief Executive\" correctly. However, \"to exercise other functions under Ordinances and as assigned by the Financial Secretary\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is the most fluent and grammatically accurate. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" correctly. The phrase \"carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as executing functions under other ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary\" is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Similar to the fourth, but the phrase \"as well as other ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary\" is slightly unclear, as it could be interpreted as \"other ordinances\" being functions, which is not the intended meaning.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" in the first sentence, which is not consistent with the dictionary. Also, the phrase \"functions conferred upon the Financial Secretary under that Ordinance\" is incorrect, as the functions are conferred upon the Monetary Authority, not the Financial Secretary.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"Monetary Authority\" consistently, as per the dictionary, and should use \"HKMA Chief Executive\" or \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" for \"金管局總裁.\" The sentence structure should be clear and natural, avoiding redundancy and ambiguity. The phrase \"carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as executing functions under other ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary\" from the fourth translation is the most natural and accurate.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as executing functions under other ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" \"Banking Ordinance,\" \"licensed banks,\" \"restricted licence banks,\" and \"deposit-taking companies.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate legal terminology, such as \"regulates and supervises,\" \"powers and duties,\" and \"eligibility.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be ambiguous in a global context.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"authorization matters\" instead of \"eligibility,\" which is not an exact match for the original term \"認可資格.\"\n- **Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is more precise than just \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"recognition qualifications,\" which is not a direct match for \"認可資格\" and is less natural in English legal language.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"eligibility for licensed banks\" and \"recognition of eligibility,\" which is slightly awkward and less precise than \"eligibility matters.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 4 and also uses \"recognition qualifications,\" which is not ideal.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"金融管理專員\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" to be specific and accurate.\n- \"認可資格\" should be translated as \"eligibility\" or \"eligibility matters,\" not \"recognition qualifications.\"\n- The phrase \"根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力\" is best rendered as \"under the powers and duties conferred by the Banking Ordinance.\"\n- The sentence structure should be concise and natural, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority regulates and supervises banking and deposit-taking businesses under the powers and duties conferred by the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for handling the eligibility matters of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, formality, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance,\" \"banking sector entities,\" \"resolution authority,\" and \"financial system.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the legal tone and formality.\n- The use of verbs like \"grants,\" \"confers,\" \"empowers,\" and \"designates\" is appropriate for legal texts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, which is more precise than \"Monetary Authority\" alone. However, it uses \"carry out an orderly resolution,\" which is slightly less formal than \"conduct an orderly resolution.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"a range of powers\" and \"orderly resolve,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"conduct an orderly resolution.\"\n- **Translation 3** introduces \"insolvency,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the original text and may misrepresent the intended meaning of \"unsustainable operation.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without \"Hong Kong,\" which is less precise and could be ambiguous.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"empowers the Monetary Authority with a range of powers,\" which is redundant and slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, using \"confers on the Monetary Authority a range of powers\" and \"orderly resolve,\" but it uses \"financial system in Hong Kong\" instead of \"Hong Kong's financial system,\" which is slightly less concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The most accurate and formal translation should use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary, since it is the full and official name.\n- The phrase \"conduct an orderly resolution\" is more formal and precise than \"carry out an orderly resolution\" or \"orderly resolve.\"\n- The phrase \"the risks posed by their unsustainable operations to the stability and effective functioning of the financial system\" is the most accurate and concise, avoiding the misinterpretation of \"insolvency\" and maintaining the legal tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance designates the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Ordinance confers on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority a range of powers to conduct an orderly resolution of such entities, thereby reducing the risks posed by their unsustainable operations to the stability and effective functioning of the financial system.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and formality that can affect the tone and precision of the translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the official English names for the legislation from the dictionary: \"Securities and Futures Ordinance\" and \"Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance.\"\n- The term \"banks’ securities and mandatory provident fund businesses\" is consistently and accurately translated across all versions.\n- The use of \"confer upon,\" \"empower,\" and \"grant\" are all valid synonyms for the verb \"賦予\" (to confer\/assign), and they are used appropriately in legal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, third, and sixth translations use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" while the others use \"Monetary Authority.\" The dictionary lists both as acceptable, but \"Monetary Authority\" is more concise and commonly used in legal texts unless the full name is required for clarity.\n- The second translation uses \"empower the Monetary Authority with certain powers,\" which is slightly redundant (\"empower\" and \"powers\" are semantically overlapping).\n- The fourth and fifth translations are identical and use \"Monetary Authority\" without the \"Hong Kong\" qualifier, which is acceptable but less specific than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- To maintain consistency with the dictionary and ensure clarity, \"Monetary Authority\" is preferable unless the full name is necessary for legal precision.\n- \"Confer upon\" is the most formal and precise verb in this context, aligning well with the formal tone of the original text.\n- The phrase \"relating to\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"regarding\" in legal writing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer upon the Monetary Authority certain powers relating to banks’ securities and mandatory provident fund businesses.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal statement, and the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and structure that affect clarity and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Insurance Ordinance,\" \"insurance activities of banks,\" \"inspection and investigation powers,\" and either \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- The sentence structure in all translations is grammatically sound and conveys the intended meaning.\n- The use of \"provides for,\" \"stipulates that,\" and \"provides that\" are all appropriate in legal contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and second translations use \"regarding\" and \"over,\" respectively. While both are acceptable, \"regarding\" is slightly more formal and precise in legal contexts.\n- The third and sixth translations use \"relating to\" and \"concerning,\" which are also acceptable but slightly less direct than \"regarding.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"may be delegated to the Monetary Authority,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the passive voice used in other translations.\n- The use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more specific than \"Monetary Authority,\" but the original text does not specify \"Hong Kong,\" so \"Monetary Authority\" is sufficient unless context demands otherwise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The most natural and formal legal phrasing would use \"provides that\" or \"stipulates that\" to introduce the legal provision.\n- \"Regarding\" is more direct and commonly used in legal English than \"relating to\" or \"concerning.\"\n- The phrase \"may be delegated\" is passive and appropriate in legal writing, but the structure should be clear and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that the inspection and investigation powers regarding the insurance activities of banks may be delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of legal or regulatory text. The key elements are the name of the ordinance, the authority granted to the Monetary Authority, and the action (supervising banks in compliance with the ordinance's provisions).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"supervise banks in compliance with the provisions of the Ordinance.\" This is accurate and fluent. However, \"supervise banks in compliance\" is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"supervise banks’ compliance with its provisions.\" This is more concise and natural, using \"its\" to refer to the Ordinance. However, \"its\" may be ambiguous if the reader is unsure whether it refers to the Ordinance or the Monetary Authority.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less specific. Also, \"in complying with\" is slightly less natural than \"in compliance with.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"supervise banks’ compliance with the Ordinance’s provisions.\" This is very clear and natural, with \"the Ordinance’s\" making the reference unambiguous.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"regulate banks to comply with the provisions of the Ordinance.\" While grammatically correct, \"regulate\" is not the exact term used in the original, which is \"監管\" (supervise). \"Regulate\" may imply a broader or more active role than intended.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"supervise banks in complying with the provisions of the Ordinance.\" This is very close to the original structure and is grammatically correct. However, \"in complying with\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"in compliance with.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most natural phrasing in English while accurately reflecting the original meaning. It should also use the exact term \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary, and clearly reference the Ordinance's provisions.\nThe fourth and sixth translations are the strongest. The fourth is slightly more concise and avoids the potential ambiguity of \"its.\" The sixth is very close to the original structure and is grammatically sound.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the Ordinance’s provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance empowers the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to provide assistance in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation to depositors of insolvent banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision in capturing the nuances of the original Chinese.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the official English names for the legal document and key terms from the dictionary, such as \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance,\" \"stored value facilities,\" and \"retail payment systems.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the legal tone is appropriately maintained.\n- Most translations use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as the official title, which is appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The original text refers to \"金融管理專員,\" which is best translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" to reflect the official title.\n- **Nuance in Meaning:** The original text uses the phrase \"對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統.\" Some translations use \"functioning as an international financial centre,\" while others use \"role as an international financial centre.\" \"Functioning\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Verb Choice:** The original uses \"監察\" (supervise\/monitor), and while all translations use \"supervise\" or \"monitor,\" \"supervise\" is more commonly used in legal and regulatory contexts.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"to ensure they are safe and efficient\" versus \"to ensure their safety and efficiency,\" which is more concise and natural.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently to match the official title.\n- Use \"functioning\" rather than \"role\" to better reflect the dynamic aspect of the IFC.\n- Use \"supervise\" for \"監察\" to maintain a formal and legal tone.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, under the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, may designate and supervise settlement and clearing systems that are important for the stability of Hong Kong's currency or financial system, or for Hong Kong's functioning as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for stored value facilities, and to designate retail payment systems and supervise the safety and efficiency of their operations.\n\n# HKMA and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"public officers\" consistently and correctly applies the term \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員.\" However, \"the Monetary Authority\" could be more precise as \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" to match the dictionary's second option.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate but uses \"public officials\" instead of \"public officers,\" which is slightly less precise in the context of government roles. It also uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be less clear.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is very well-written and grammatically sound. It uses \"public officials\" and \"conferred upon or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\" However, \"Monetary Authority\" should be \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"public officials\" and \"expertise\" instead of \"specialized knowledge,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation. It also uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is accurate and uses \"public officers\" and \"persons\" instead of \"individuals,\" which is a stylistic choice. It also uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first and is accurate. It uses \"public officers\" and \"the scope of the statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\" However, \"Monetary Authority\" should be \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"HKMA\" should be used consistently as per the dictionary.\n- \"Public officers\" is more precise than \"public officials\" in the context of government roles.\n- \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" should be used instead of just \"Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n- \"Statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is the most precise phrasing.\n- \"Appropriate experience and specialized knowledge\" is the most accurate rendering of the original.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but it may employ staff under terms of appointment different from those applicable to civil service to attract persons with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA Chief Executive and his staff are public officers. The day-to-day operations of the HKMA enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the scope of statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly. The term \"Currency Board system\" is used, which is acceptable. However, the phrase \"it was stipulated that\" is slightly passive and less direct than \"stated that\" or \"specified that.\" The use of \"Monetary Stability\" is inconsistent with the dictionary, which lists \"currency stability\" as the preferred term.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Correctly uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Monetary Authority.\" The term \"Currency Board system\" is used, and \"currency stability\" is used consistently. The translation is fluent and accurate, though \"Monetary Authority\" is less specific than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: Similar to the second, but uses \"must be responsible\" which is slightly more rigid than \"is responsible.\" The term \"Currency Board system\" is used, and \"currency stability\" is consistent. The translation is accurate but slightly less fluid.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" instead of \"Currency Board system,\" which is an acceptable alternative. The phrase \"currency policy objectives\" is slightly different from \"monetary policy objectives,\" which may be less precise. The use of \"around HK$7.80 to US$1\" is more concise and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" and \"currency stability\" consistently. The phrase \"HK$7.80 per US dollar\" is slightly more natural than \"7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, with minimal deviations from the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"Currency Board system\" and \"currency stability\" correctly. The phrase \"instruments\" is used instead of \"tools,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable. The translation is accurate and fluent, though slightly more formal.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"currency stability\" should be used consistently, as per the dictionary.\n- \"Currency Board system\" and \"Currency Board arrangements\" are both acceptable, but \"Currency Board system\" is more commonly used in this context.\n- \"Monetary Authority\" should be replaced with \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and specificity.\n- The phrase \"per US dollar\" is more natural than \"to 1 US dollar.\"\n- The use of \"determine\" or \"set\" for \"釐定\" is acceptable, but \"determine\" is more precise in this context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, the Financial Secretary stipulated that currency stability should be maintained through the Currency Board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 per US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor variations in terminology, phrasing, and consistency. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" \"legal tender notes and coins,\" \"debt market,\" \"financial infrastructure,\" and \"International Financial Centre.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, and the meaning is well-preserved.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate vocabulary for formal, official documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use \"banking system\" while others use \"banking sector.\" While both are acceptable, \"banking system\" is more precise in the context of financial regulation.\n- **\"Payment\" vs. \"clearing and settlement systems\":** One translation incorrectly uses \"payment\" as a standalone term for \"支付、結算及交收系統,\" which is a misinterpretation. The correct term is \"clearing and settlement systems.\"\n- **\"Financial Services\" vs. \"financial services\":** Some translations capitalize \"Financial Services\" inconsistently, which may be misleading in a formal context.\n- **\"Where appropriate\" vs. \"when appropriate\":** While both are acceptable, \"where appropriate\" is more commonly used in formal writing.\n- **\"Foster confidence\" vs. \"enhance confidence\":** \"Foster\" is slightly more nuanced and appropriate in the context of building trust in financial systems.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"banking system\" consistently for \"銀行體系.\"\n- Use \"clearing and settlement systems\" for \"支付、結算及交收系統.\"\n- Use \"financial services\" in lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Use \"where appropriate\" for consistency with formal writing.\n- Use \"foster confidence\" for a more precise and formal tone.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate these refinements while maintaining the clarity and accuracy of the original text.\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and to preserve Hong Kong’s status as an International Financial Centre. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority is responsible for:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of clearing and settlement systems, and where appropriate, operating such systems\n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe original text outlines the authority structure regarding the Exchange Fund, emphasizing the Financial Secretary's control and the Monetary Authority's responsibilities under delegated powers. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology and phrasing that affect clarity and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"Financial Secretary\" is consistently used, with some variations using \"FS\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n- \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" are both valid, though \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more specific and accurate in this context.\n- The phrase \"powers delegated by the Financial Secretary\" is well used in several translations, accurately reflecting the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"must be responsible\" or \"must be accountable,\" which are grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"is responsible\" or \"is accountable.\"\n- The term \"investment management\" appears in the dictionary, and while it is used in several translations, it is sometimes paired with redundant terms like \"management and investment management.\"\n- The use of \"deployment\" in one translation is not a direct match for the original term and may be less precise.\n- \"Utilization\" in one translation is not a direct synonym for \"use\" in this context and may be less natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and specificity.\n- Use \"is accountable\" instead of \"must be accountable\" for a more formal and natural tone.\n- Ensure that \"investment management\" is used without redundancy.\n- Maintain consistency in the use of \"Financial Secretary\" rather than switching to \"FS.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, acting under the delegated powers of the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\nThe original text is a simple title consisting of two key terms: \"問責性\" (accountability) and \"透明度\" (transparency). All junior translators have correctly identified these terms and translated them accurately. The only variation among the translations is the capitalization of \"Transparency.\" In English, titles are typically capitalized, so \"Accountability and Transparency\" is the most appropriate and standard form. The other translations, while correct in meaning, are less conventional in terms of title formatting. Therefore, the best possible translation is \"Accountability and Transparency,\" which adheres to standard title capitalization and maintains the intended meaning of the original text.\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) autonomy in daily operations and policy implementation, while also highlighting its accountability and transparency. All six translations capture the core meaning, but they vary in fluency, structure, and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"high degree of autonomy\" is consistently used, which is appropriate.\n- The inclusion of \"accountability and transparency\" is accurate and aligns with the original intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"while also ensuring,\" which is slightly less natural than \"while also being supported by\" or \"while simultaneously upholding.\"\n- The second translation uses \"consistently maintained\" and \"simultaneously upholding,\" which are more fluent and precise.\n- The third and fifth translations are very similar and both use \"consistently maintained\" and \"while also ensuring,\" which is acceptable but not the most natural phrasing.\n- The fourth translation introduces \"the methods it employs,\" which is redundant and slightly wordy.\n- The sixth translation uses \"supported by a strong sense of accountability and transparency,\" which is slightly less direct than \"supported by a high level of accountability and transparency.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"consistently maintained\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the HKMA's autonomy.\n- Use \"while simultaneously upholding\" to convey the parallel nature of accountability and transparency.\n- Avoid redundancy and unnecessary elaboration.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in implementing government policy objectives, while simultaneously upholding high levels of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in tone, word choice, and fluency that can be refined for greater precision and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"financial infrastructure\" for \"金融基建.\"\n- The term \"banking system\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary's first option.\n- The phrase \"domestic economy\" is correctly used for \"香港經濟.\"\n- The term \"international financial centre\" is used appropriately, with some variations in capitalization and form (e.g., \"International Financial Centre\" vs. \"international financial centre\").\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"promoting\" vs. \"striving to promote\" or \"dedicated to promoting\" introduces slight variations in tone. \"Dedicated\" and \"strives to\" may be more formal or active, depending on the intended tone.\n- \"Supervising\" vs. \"monitoring\" vs. \"overseeing\" are all acceptable, but \"monitoring\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- \"Consolidating Hong Kong's position\" vs. \"status\" is a minor stylistic choice, but \"status\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- \"Driving the development\" is slightly more active than \"promoting the development,\" but both are acceptable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"dedicated to promoting\" for a more formal and committed tone.\n- Use \"monitoring\" for consistency with regulatory language.\n- Use \"status\" for \"position\" to align with common formal usage.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"international financial centre\" (e.g., with capitalization and article usage).\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA is dedicated to promoting monetary and banking system stability, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and promoting the development of the domestic economy.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, word choice, and structure that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary, and the accurate rendering of key concepts such as \"履行職責\" (fulfill responsibilities), \"社會人士的信心\" (public confidence), and \"嚴謹的態度\" (rigorous approach). The phrase \"處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項\" is also well translated in all versions, with slight variations in phrasing such as \"address issues of public concern that fall within its mandate\" or \"handle matters of public concern that fall within its responsibilities.\"\nWeaknesses include some redundancy and awkward phrasing. For example, \"adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility of explaining its policies and work to the public\" (Translation 2) is slightly wordy. Similarly, \"makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities\" (Translation 3) is more verbose than necessary.\nThe most fluent and concise version is Translation 4: \"The HKMA must effectively fulfill its responsibilities to gain public confidence. Therefore, the HKMA rigorously explains its policies and work to the public and strives to handle matters of public concern that fall within its purview.\" This version is concise, uses natural phrasing, and avoids redundancy.\nHowever, \"effectively fulfill its responsibilities to gain public confidence\" in Translation 4 slightly misplaces the causal relationship. The original text emphasizes that gaining public confidence is a prerequisite for effectively fulfilling responsibilities, not a result of fulfilling them.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the causal relationship accurately, use natural and concise phrasing, and ensure that the structure reflects the original meaning clearly.\nFinal Translation:\nIn order to effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the HKMA must gain the confidence of the public. Therefore, it adopts a rigorous approach in explaining its policies and work to the public, and strives to address issues of public concern that fall within its mandate.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. While all translations capture the general meaning of the original text, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"HKMA,\" \"Legislative Council,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" and \"liberalisation\" where applicable.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points about accountability, transparency, and public engagement are preserved.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor issues in word choice or phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA\" in the first sentence, which is not consistent with the dictionary. The dictionary specifies \"HKMA\" as the correct translation for \"金管局,\" so \"Monetary Authority\" should be replaced with \"HKMA\" for consistency.\n- **Use of \"liberalisation\":** While \"liberalisation\" is the dictionary term for \"開放,\" it is not the most natural or contextually appropriate word in this context. \"Openness\" or \"open policy\" would be more natural in the context of transparency and public engagement.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"striving to enhance transparency and maintain liberalisation\" or \"keeps its finger on the pulse of society,\" which can be simplified without losing meaning.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The phrase \"keeps its finger on the pulse of society\" is idiomatic but may not be the most natural in formal English. A more direct phrasing like \"remains attuned to public sentiment\" would be more appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for \"金管局\" throughout the text.\n- Replace \"liberalisation\" with \"openness\" or \"open policy\" to better reflect the intended meaning.\n- Simplify and streamline phrasing for clarity and fluency.\n- Ensure that the translation maintains a formal and professional tone, consistent with the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary and is therefore accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, since the HKMA’s powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. In addition, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining broad engagement with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure, as far as possible, that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA’s work, while respecting statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data;\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Information Centre,\" \"guided tours,\" \"library,\" \"public education programmes,\" and \"official website.\"\n- The structure and content of the translations are largely consistent with the original text.\n- Most translations use natural English phrasing and maintain the formal tone appropriate for an official document.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Liberalisation\"** is incorrectly used in place of **\"開放\" (open)** in the first junior translator's version. This is a critical error, as \"liberalisation\" refers to economic policy, not the act of being open for visits.\n- Some translations use **\"Organizational Functions\"** or **\"Institutional Functions\"** for **\"機構職能\"**, which is acceptable, but **\"Functions of the Authority\"** is more precise and aligns better with the official tone.\n- The use of **\"best practices\"** in the second translation is slightly less precise than **\"highest international standards\"** used in others.\n- The phrase **\"maintaining extensive contact with the media\"** is more natural than **\"maintaining extensive media contacts\"**.\n- Some translations use **\"presentation materials\"** or **\"presentation documents\"**, which are less precise than **\"briefing materials\"** or **\"briefing documents\"**.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use **\"Functions of the Authority\"** for **\"機構職能\"** to maintain consistency with official terminology.\n- The term **\"open\"** should be used instead of **\"liberalisation\"** for **\"開放\"**.\n- The phrase **\"highest international standards\"** is more precise than **\"best practices\"**.\n- The use of **\"briefing materials\"** or **\"briefing documents\"** is more appropriate than **\"presentation materials\"**.\n- The phrase **\"maintaining extensive contact with the media\"** is more natural and commonly used in official contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency, maintaining extensive contact with the media, and publishing various bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an Information Centre, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. The HKMA also organizes public education programmes, offering lectures and guided tours of the Information Centre to explain the HKMA’s work to the public, especially students, and to enhance citizens’ financial knowledge. For detailed information on the HKMA’s media liaison work, publications, and public education programmes, see the \"Functions of the Authority\" chapter.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in tone, formality, and precision that can be refined for optimal clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" and \"supervisory policies and guidelines on banking.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of terms like \"disclosing information,\" \"publishing data,\" and \"featured\/contained\" are all appropriate and convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"central banking\" as a noun, which is grammatically correct but less common in this context. \"Central banks\" or \"central banking institutions\" might be more natural.\n- The phrase \"the central banking 'Special Data Dissemination Standard' project\" is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"the Special Data Dissemination Standard project of the International Monetary Fund.\"\n- The use of \"minutes of meetings\" in one translation is slightly redundant, as \"minutes\" already implies a meeting.\n- The verb \"featured\" or \"contained\" is acceptable, but \"carried\" or \"hosted\" might be more natural in the context of a website.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"central banks\" instead of \"central banking\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Ensure consistency in the phrasing of the \"Special Data Dissemination Standard project\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Use \"minutes\" without \"of meetings\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Use \"carried\" or \"hosted\" for the website content to reflect the action of publishing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has progressively increased the frequency of publishing information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s central banks \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" project in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on Currency Board operations. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also carried supervisory policies and guidelines on banking.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for \"HKMA,\" \"Legislative Council,\" and \"Panel on Financial Affairs.\"\n- Most translations accurately reflect the key points: the importance of the relationship, the frequency of briefings, and the role of HKMA representatives in attending meetings and assisting with legislation.\n- The use of terms like \"briefings,\" \"answer inquiries,\" and \"assist legislators\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Panel on Financial Affairs\" correctly but says \"the Legislative Council's Panel on Financial Affairs,\" which is slightly awkward. It also uses \"related inquiries\" instead of \"relevant inquiries,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, but it uses \"committee meetings of the Legislative Council\" instead of the exact term \"panel and committee meetings\" from the dictionary.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"panel and committee meetings\" correctly but says \"explain and discuss special matters\" instead of \"special matters\" or \"specific matters,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Financial Affairs Committee\" instead of \"Panel on Financial Affairs,\" which is not one of the dictionary options. It also uses \"Bills Committee\" instead of \"committee meetings,\" which is not exact.\n- **Translation 5** is fluent and accurate, using \"Panel on Financial Affairs\" and \"panel and committee meetings\" correctly. It also uses \"legislative proposals\" instead of \"draft legislation,\" which is slightly less standard.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Standing Committee on Bills\" instead of \"committee meetings,\" which is not one of the dictionary options. It also uses \"members\" instead of \"legislators,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"Panel on Financial Affairs,\" \"panel and committee meetings,\" and \"Legislative Council.\"\n- Use natural, fluent English.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for a government-related text.\n- Use precise terms like \"draft legislation\" and \"legislators.\"\nBased on this, the best translation would combine the strengths of translations 2, 5, and 6, while ensuring exact dictionary term usage and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is vital for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Chief Executive has committed to briefing the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA’s work and policies, and to answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will also attend panel and committee meetings of the Legislative Council from time to time to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC),\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Financial Secretary (FS),\" \"Chief Executive,\" and \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\" However, some translations use \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" interchangeably, which may cause confusion. The dictionary lists both, but \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more precise and should be used when referring to the official body.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations vary in fluency. The first and third translations are slightly more verbose and less concise. The second and fifth translations are more fluent and natural in their phrasing. The fourth and sixth translations are also strong, with the sixth being particularly precise in its use of \"shall\" and \"serves as.\"\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**: The use of \"ex officio chairman\" is appropriate, but \"ex-officio\" (with a hyphen) is more commonly used in formal contexts. The phrase \"in their individual capacities\" is more precise than \"in their personal capacity\" when referring to appointments.\n4. **Clarity and Precision**: The phrase \"take into account the views\" (third translation) is slightly less direct than \"consult the opinion\" or \"seek the opinion.\" The use of \"stipulates\" is appropriate, but \"provision stipulates\" is slightly awkward; \"provision states\" or \"provision provides\" may be more natural.\n5. **Redundancy and Repetition**: Some translations repeat the phrase \"when exercising control over the Exchange Fund,\" which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary shall consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The EFAC was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision states that the Financial Secretary must consult the EFAC when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex-officio chairman of the EFAC, while other members (including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their individual capacities, upon authorization from the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the EFAC. The professional expertise and experience of the members cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and stylistic consistency that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\", \"HKMA\", \"Sub-Committee\", and \"Financial Secretary (FS)\".\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- The use of \"EFAC\" as an abbreviation is appropriately introduced in most translations, enhancing readability.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined by using \"EFAC\" after the first mention.\n- **Verb Tense and Clarity:** The phrase \"reporting to the Financial Secretary via the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" in the first translation is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"reporting to the Financial Secretary through EFAC.\"\n- **Word Choice:** \"Monitoring the work of the HKMA in specific areas\" (second translation) is slightly less precise than \"overseeing specific aspects of the HKMA's work\" (used in others), which better reflects the original Chinese term \"監察金管局特定環節的工作.\"\n- **Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases:** The use of \"relating to the work of the HKMA\" (sixth translation) is slightly less direct than \"related to the HKMA's work.\"\n- **Fluency and Style:** The sixth translation uses \"a total of five meetings\" and \"most of which were discussed beforehand,\" which are slightly more formal and less concise than alternatives like \"held five meetings\" and \"pre-discussed.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"EFAC\" consistently after the first mention.\n- Use precise and concise verbs such as \"oversee\" and \"report.\"\n- Avoid redundancy by using abbreviations where appropriate.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is clear and natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations that may sound awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has five Sub-Committees responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the HKMA's work and reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through EFAC. In 2018, EFAC held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the HKMA's work, with most of these matters having been pre-discussed by the relevant Sub-Committees.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for \"金管局\" (HKMA), \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" (Exchange Fund Advisory Committee or EFAC), \"管治委員會\" (Governance Sub-Committee or GSC), \"薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策\" (remuneration and human resources policies), \"財政預算、行政及管治事務\" (budgetary, administrative and governance issues), \"年度薪酬檢討\" (annual pay review), and \"策略性規劃事宜\" (strategic planning matters). However, some translations use \"budgetary\" as a standalone term, which is not ideal as it lacks context. The dictionary lists \"budgetary\" as part of a phrase, so it should be paired with \"issues\" or \"matters.\"\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some have minor grammatical issues. For example, \"provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the HKMA's remuneration and human resources policies, administrative and governance issues, and budgetary matters\" (Translation 1) is slightly awkward due to the list structure. Similarly, \"budgetary\" used alone in some translations (e.g., Translation 2) is less natural.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard formal English suitable for official reports or documents.\n4. **Consistency**: Translation 6 is the most consistent in using the dictionary terms and maintaining a formal tone. It also includes the abbreviations (GSC and EFAC), which may be preferred in certain contexts.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) monitors the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) on remuneration and human resources policies, budgetary, administrative, and governance matters. The committee held five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA's expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual pay review, and strategic planning matters. The committee also reviewed the HKMA's regularly submitted work reports.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. However, the phrase \"as well as submits reports\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for better flow.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. The use of \"assesses whether its internal control systems are adequate and effective\" is more natural than \"evaluates the sufficiency and effectiveness.\" The phrase \"do not have any executive functions\" is slightly less precise than \"have no administrative functions.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but \"preparing the components and accounting principles of these statements\" is misleading, as the committee does not prepare the statements, only reviews them. This is a critical error in meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The use of past tense (\"reviewed,\" \"assessed,\" \"submitted\") is inconsistent with the original text, which is in present tense. This may imply that the actions have already been completed, which is not the case. The phrase \"None of the Audit Sub-Committee members\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is the most fluent and natural. It uses \"evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness\" and \"works together with external and internal auditors to review the scope and results of the audits,\" which are both natural and precise. The only minor issue is the use of \"the Committee\" at the end, which should be \"the committee\" for consistency.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the fifth, but \"preparing the components and accounting principles of such statements\" is again misleading, as the committee does not prepare the statements. The phrase \"examining their audit scope and findings\" is slightly less precise than \"reviewing their audit scope and results.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should maintain the present tense to reflect ongoing responsibilities, use natural phrasing, and avoid misleading interpretations. It should also ensure that the committee is not portrayed as preparing financial statements, but rather reviewing them. Based on this, the fifth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, with minor adjustments for consistency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Audit Sub-Committee reviews the HKMA's financial reporting procedures and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, and submits reports. The Audit Sub-Committee is responsible for examining the HKMA's financial statements, the components of those statements and the accounting principles used in their preparation, and works together with external and internal auditors to review the scope and results of the audits. The members of the Audit Sub-Committee have no administrative functions within the HKMA. The committee held two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Division.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Currency Board Sub-Committee\" and \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" correctly. However, \"this as a pillar\" is slightly awkward; \"this situation as a pillar\" would be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"oversees\" instead of \"monitors,\" which is more appropriate in this formal context. It also uses \"cornerstone\" instead of \"pillar,\" which is a more idiomatic expression in English. The use of \"its status as a cornerstone\" is more natural than \"this as a pillar.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is grammatically correct but less fluent. It uses \"this situation as a pillar,\" which is awkward. Also, \"submits Currency Board operations reports to the committee\" is incorrect; the HKMA publishes the reports, not submits them.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"oversees\" and \"role as a pillar,\" which are both natural. However, \"the committee\" is used in lowercase in some instances, which is inconsistent with the formal tone of the text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"status as a pillar\" and \"the Hong Kong Linked Exchange Rate System,\" which are both appropriate. However, \"the reports on the operations of the Currency Board system submitted to the committee\" is slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most polished and accurate translation. It uses \"oversees,\" \"role as a pillar,\" and \"high level of transparency,\" which are all natural and appropriate. It also maintains consistent capitalization of \"Committee\" and \"HKMA,\" which is important for formality.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"oversees\" instead of \"monitors\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"cornerstone\" or \"pillar\" to describe the role of the Currency Board system in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of \"Committee\" and \"HKMA.\"\n- Use \"reports on the operations of the Currency Board system\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Maintain grammatical precision and fluency throughout.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee oversees the operations of the Currency Board system and reports on its role as a pillar of Hong Kong's Linked Exchange Rate System. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Currency Board system operates in accordance with established policies, proposing recommendations for improving the system, and ensuring that the system's operations maintain a high level of transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee meetings and the reports on the operations of the Currency Board system submitted to the Committee. The Committee held four meetings in 2018.\n"}

實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4

物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

conditions tightened and trade protectionism intensified, uncertainties increased, leading to a weakening of growth momentum during the year. With global economic expansion slowing, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will also decelerate in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong's domestic economy continued to expand, although the year-on-year growth rate slowed gradually from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in domestic demand growth and the continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but subsequently lost momentum, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and wealth effects from local asset price corrections. Due to fragile business confidence, the growth rate of overall investment spending also slowed. Externally, exports of goods remained largely stable in the first three quarters, but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter as US-China trade tensions intensified. Imports of goods also slowed due to weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, exports of services recorded faster annual growth, partly benefiting from robust performance in inbound tourism, while imports of services maintained growth momentum largely due to growth in transportation, business and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance shifted from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down domestic economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change in total local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth.

Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency Condition\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"LERS,\" \"HIBOR,\" \"Best Lending Rates,\" and \"basis points.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key economic concepts are well conveyed.\n- The translations are fluent and maintain the formal tone appropriate for financial and economic content.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"interbank interest rates\" instead of \"HIBOR\" in one instance, which is less precise.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"interbank interest rates (HIBOR)\" which is redundant and slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"HKD\/USD\" and \"HKD per USD,\" which is acceptable but less formal than \"Hong Kong dollar to U.S. dollar.\"\n- **Translation 4** includes the character \"兑\" (which means \"against\") in the phrase \"Hong Kong dollar兑US dollar exchange rate,\" which is an error in the translation and should be removed.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"as stipulated by the Linked Exchange Rate System\" which is slightly wordy and less direct than \"in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- **Translation 6** has a minor error in the phrase \"raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 to basis points\" which is incomplete and should be \"raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"HIBOR\" where appropriate.\n- Use \"in accordance with\" or \"as stipulated by\" for the LERS, depending on context.\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure clarity in phrasing.\n- Correct any grammatical or typographical errors, such as the inclusion of Chinese characters in the translation.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the U.S. dollar generally softened in 2018, mainly affected by carry trade activity under the negative interest rate differentials between the two currencies. In particular, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the HKMA to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at the level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar, in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). According to the design of the LERS, the Monetary Base consequently contracted, indicating a decrease in interbank liquidity. Coupled with market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, this led to an overall increase in Hong Kong interbank interest rates (HIBOR). As the banking system’s funding costs rose, banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the upward adjustment of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range in late September. In terms of credit growth, partly due to a slowdown in local economic growth and weaker external trade performance, the overall growth rate of bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures rose slightly in 2018. Excluding the impact of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate increased from 1.7%, a low level in 2017, to 2.6% in 2018, although it remained at a moderate level. The housing component grew more rapidly, reflecting the impact of earlier increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Figure 2). A broader analysis showed that growth in nominal labour costs and commercial rentals accelerated slightly, making local cost pressures more pronounced. With inflation rising in some of Hong Kong's major import source countries, import price inflation also rose accordingly.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nData Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"Labour market,\" \"service sectors,\" \"unemployment rate,\" \"accommodation and food services sector,\" \"private-sector vacancies,\" \"real wage,\" and \"labour force participation rate.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and accurate across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Labour market\" with a capital \"L,\" which is inconsistent with the lowercase usage in the original text and may be unnecessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n- The phrase \"the lowest level since 1997\" is repeated in all translations, which is acceptable but could be slightly rephrased for variety.\n- Some translations use \"real wage and income\" instead of \"real wages and incomes,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less idiomatic.\n- The phrase \"with the total number of employed persons\" is more formal than \"with total employment numbers,\" which is more concise and commonly used in economic reports.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"labour market\" with a lowercase \"l\" unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Consider using \"real wages and incomes\" for consistency with the plural form of \"wage\" and \"income.\"\n- Use more concise phrasing such as \"total employment numbers\" instead of \"the total number of employed persons.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"tightening labour market conditions\" or \"as the labour market tightened\" for smoother flow.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe labour market remained stable in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Unemployment rates in most major service sectors declined, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector, which saw a more significant drop. With further increases in total employment numbers and private-sector vacancies, overall labour demand continued to strengthen, and the labour force participation rate also rose slightly. As the labour market tightened, real wages and incomes further increased.\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"US-China trade tensions,\" \"average daily turnover,\" and \"emerging and innovative sectors.\" However, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for greater clarity, fluency, and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the main points of the original text, including the reversal in the Hong Kong stock market in 2018, the performance of the Hang Seng Index, and the factors influencing the market.\n- The use of the dictionary terms is consistent and correct across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the market's optimism rapidly reversed\" or \"market optimism reversed dramatically,\" which can be improved for smoother readability.\n- The use of \"HKD\" is inconsistent in some translations, with some using \"HK$,\" which is also acceptable but should be standardized.\n- The phrase \"the total fundraising from initial public offerings in Hong Kong also rose significantly due to the listing of several companies engaged in emerging and innovative sectors\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"market sentiment turned sharply negative\" or \"investor optimism gave way to pessimism.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"HK$\" or \"HKD\" throughout the translation.\n- Simplify some of the more complex sentence structures for better readability.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the accuracy of the original text, use natural and fluent English, and ensure consistency in terminology and currency notation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. The Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018, driven by strong upward momentum from 2017 (Figure 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, US-China trade tensions escalated, and concerns arose over slowing local economic growth, investor optimism gave way to pessimism. The Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed at 25,846 points by year-end, a 13.6% decline compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the average daily turnover increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, and the total funds raised from initial public offerings in Hong Kong also rose significantly due to the listing of several companies in emerging and innovative sectors.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in tone, clarity, and precision that can be refined for maximum clarity and natural English expression.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and data.\n- The dictionary terms are consistently translated correctly.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel and maintains the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of terms like \"price-to-income ratio\" and \"income-gearing ratio\" is consistent across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"local housing market\" instead of \"residential property market\" for the term \"住宅物業市場.\" While both are acceptable, \"residential property market\" is more standard in economic reports.\n- The phrase \"showed a slight decline\" or \"slightly declined\" is used in several translations. While correct, \"slightly declined\" is more concise and natural.\n- Some translations use \"rentals\" instead of \"rents,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"for the whole year\" is used in some translations, but \"for the year\" is more concise and commonly used in such reports.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"residential property market\" consistently for \"住宅物業市場.\"\n- Use \"slightly declined\" instead of \"showed a slight decline\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Use \"rents\" instead of \"rentals\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"for the year\" instead of \"for the whole year\" for conciseness.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would maintain clarity, precision, and natural English phrasing while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.\nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018, but cooled in the second half amid escalating US-China trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and rising local prime rates. Overall property prices fell 9% from their peak between July and December, although they still recorded a 2% annual increase (Figure 4). Transaction volume in 2018 declined 7% year-on-year to 57,247 transactions, as buying and selling activities in both primary and secondary markets significantly decreased in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income-gearing ratio standing at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively—both far above long-term averages. On the other hand, nonresidential property prices rose overall in 2018, though they slightly declined toward the end of the year. Prices and rents continued to increase throughout the year, while rental yields remained at low levels.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic environment\n\nDue to the slowdown in global economic expansion, Hong Kong's domestic economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in 2019. In particular, with a challenging external environment, Hong Kong's export performance is expected to remain under pressure. Domestically, although a low unemployment rate and increased household income will continue to support private consumption, the growth of private consumption is expected to slow down, partly due to weakened consumer confidence and the wealth effects of earlier asset price corrections. Regarding fixed capital formation, while building and construction activities should grow steadily with increased housing supply, businesses may become more cautious about capital investments in the face of increased economic uncertainty. The government forecasts that the real GDP growth rate in 2019 will be between 2% and 3%, while the latest forecasts from private-sector analysts average 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nDue to the slowdown in global growth, including in Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures may ease, therefore inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2019. Recent declines in newly signed residential rents will also exert a dampening effect on inflation. Market consensus forecasts the headline inflation rate for 2019 at 2.2%, while the government expects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. It is expected that with continued economic growth and sustained strong performance in inbound tourism, the labour market conditions will continue to be tight. Private-sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at approximately 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertain Factors and Risks\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and consistency with the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"geopolitical environments\" (which is acceptable, though \"geopolitical environment\" is more standard). It correctly uses \"asset markets\" and \"Real activities\" from the dictionary. The only minor issue is the use of \"geopolitical environments\" instead of \"geopolitical environment.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent but has a minor grammatical error: \"financial markets sentiment\" should be \"financial market sentiment.\" It also uses \"Real activities\" with a capital \"R,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase \"real activities.\" It uses \"geopolitical environment factors,\" which is redundant.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"geopolitical developments,\" which is a more natural choice than \"geopolitical environment.\" It correctly uses \"asset markets\" and \"real activities\" from the dictionary. It also uses \"prolonged period\" instead of \"long term,\" which is a slight stylistic difference but not incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"geopolitical environments\" (again, \"geopolitical environment\" is more standard). It correctly uses \"asset markets\" and \"real activities.\" It uses \"for a long time\" instead of \"in the long term,\" which is a minor stylistic difference.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has a minor issue with \"financial markets sentiment\" (should be \"financial market sentiment\"). It also uses \"Real activities\" with a capital \"R,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It uses \"geopolitical environment factors,\" which is redundant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"geopolitical environments\" (again, \"geopolitical environment\" is more standard). It correctly uses \"asset markets\" and \"real economic activities\" from the dictionary. It uses \"in the long term,\" which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Geopolitical environment\" is more standard than \"geopolitical environments\" or \"geopolitical environment factors.\"\n- \"Real activities\" should be lowercase as per the dictionary.\n- \"Financial market sentiment\" is more natural than \"financial markets sentiment.\"\n- \"Prolonged period\" or \"in the long term\" are both acceptable, but \"in the long term\" is more commonly used in formal writing.\n- \"Real economic activities\" is more precise than \"real activities\" in the context of economic analysis.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is influenced by uncertainties and risks such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, the performance of the Mainland economy, Brexit, and other geopolitical environments. Furthermore, if these uncertainties intensify and persist in the long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be significantly affected, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activities.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, and its outlook remains uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the Hong Kong property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment conditions and income growth remain largely stable, which may support residential property demand. The trajectory of Hong Kong's interest rates depends to some extent on future policy rate changes in the US, though the latter's direction remains unclear. In the long term, with increased flat completions in recent years and the government's efforts to boost land and housing supply, the supply-demand gap in housing is expected to narrow.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nDespite the increase in external headwinds, such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and interest rate normalisation, which have intensified financial market volatility, the Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2018. The banking sector's capital and liquidity positions were robust, and asset quality remained strong. Rising interest rates widened interest rate spreads, leading to a significant increase in bank profits.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n# Balance sheet trends\nThe original text is a single phrase: \"資產負債表走勢,\" which translates directly to \"Balance sheet trends\" according to the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used the dictionary entry, producing the same translation. However, there is a minor variation in formatting: some translations include the \"#\" symbol, while others do not.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol is common in digital or document formatting to denote headings or sections. Since the original text does not include a \"#\" symbol, it is more appropriate to omit it in the translation unless the context explicitly requires it. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"Balance sheet trends\" without the \"#\" symbol.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nBalance sheet trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"balance sheet,\" \"loans for use in Hong Kong,\" \"loans for use outside Hong Kong,\" \"trade conflicts,\" \"interest rate hikes,\" \"trade finance,\" \"Mainland-related lending,\" and \"total loan growth.\" The translations are consistent in conveying the key points of the original text: the steady growth of the banking system, the expansion of the balance sheet, the slowdown in total loan growth, the factors influencing this slowdown, and the contrasting decline in trade finance.\nHowever, there are some nuances and stylistic choices that could be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English. For example:\n- \"Faced with continued economic uncertainties\" (used in translations 1, 4, and 6) is slightly more formal than \"Facing ongoing economic uncertainties\" (used in translations 2, 3, and 5). Both are acceptable, but \"faced with\" may be more commonly used in formal reports.\n- \"Businesses became more conservative\" (translation 1) and \"businesses became more cautious\" (translations 5 and 6) are both valid, but \"cautious\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- \"Trade finance applications fell\" (translation 1) is slightly less precise than \"trade finance declined\" (translations 2, 3, 5, and 6), as \"applications\" may imply a specific type of activity rather than the general decline in trade finance.\n- \"Mainlandrelated lending\" (translations 1 and 4) is missing a hyphen, whereas \"Mainland-related lending\" (translations 2, 3, 5, and 6) is the correct hyphenated form.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would combine the most natural phrasing, accurate terminology, and clarity. It would use \"banking system\" as the term for \"銀行體系,\" \"trade conflicts\" for \"貿易衝突,\" \"interest rate hikes\" for \"加息,\" \"trade finance\" for \"貿易融資,\" \"Mainland-related lending\" for \"中國內地相關貸款,\" and \"total loan growth\" for \"貸款總額增幅.\" It would also use \"cautious\" rather than \"conservative\" to reflect the financial context more accurately.\n---\nThe banking system continued its steady growth in 2018, with the balance sheet expanding by 5.9%. Faced with persistent economic uncertainties, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, businesses became more cautious in obtaining new loans. Total loan growth for the year slowed to 4.4%, down from 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans for use in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans for use outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, due to an uncertain global trade environment, trade finance declined by 7.6%. Growth in Mainland-related lending also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"banking system\" and \"investment-grade debt securities\" appropriately. The use of \"associated credit risk\" is natural and accurate. The only minor issue is the capitalization of \"Debt securities\" which is unnecessary unless it's a proper noun.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is concise but has some issues. \"Debt securities\" is capitalized unnecessarily. Also, \"Credit risk\" is capitalized, which is not standard unless referring to a specific named risk. The phrase \"Credit risk remained low\" is less natural than \"credit risk remained at a low level.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with the exception of using \"are\" instead of \"were\" in the second sentence. This is a minor grammatical issue, as the original text refers to a past state (2018), so \"were\" is more appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is mostly correct but has the same issue as the second with the capitalization of \"Debt securities\" and \"Credit risk.\" It also uses \"remained\" in the second sentence, which is slightly inconsistent with the past tense of the first sentence.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Debt securities\" with a capital \"D\" unnecessarily. It also uses \"securities\" instead of \"debt securities\" in the second sentence, which is slightly less precise than using the full term \"debt securities.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most natural and fluent translation. It uses \"debt securities\" consistently without unnecessary capitalization. It also uses \"credit risk\" in lowercase, which is appropriate. The use of \"were\" in the second sentence aligns with the past tense of the first sentence.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should maintain the correct tense, avoid unnecessary capitalization, and use the most natural phrasing. The sixth translation is the closest to this ideal, but it can be slightly refined for fluency and precision.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Since most of these debt securities were investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase than the 8.7% growth in 2017. Due to expectations of continued interest rate hikes in the U.S., some banks raised time deposit rates to attract depositors to convert current and savings deposits into time deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of current and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to an increase in funding costs. As the growth in total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly decreased from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\nThe original title, \"圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款,\" translates to \"Figure 5: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System.\" The junior translators have all captured the essential meaning, but there are subtle differences in punctuation, capitalization, and preposition usage that affect fluency and consistency.\nThe first translation, \"Figure 5: Loans and deposits of the banking system,\" is grammatically correct and uses lowercase for \"loans and deposits,\" which is acceptable in titles but less formal. The second translation, \"Figure 5: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System,\" capitalizes all major words, which is more consistent with title case and improves readability. The third and sixth translations omit the colon, which is less standard for figure captions. The fourth translation uses \"in the banking system,\" which is slightly less direct than \"of the banking system.\" The fifth translation mirrors the first but uses \"in\" instead of \"of.\"\nThe dictionary specifies that \"銀行體系\" should be translated as either \"banking system\" or \"banking sector.\" In this context, \"banking system\" is more appropriate, as it refers to the entire network of banks and their operations, which aligns with the concept of loans and deposits.\nThe best translation should follow title case, use the correct preposition (\"of\"), and maintain consistency with standard figure captions. Therefore, \"Figure 5: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\" is the most accurate and fluent translation.\n\n# Capital Adequacy\n\nThe original text discusses the financial health of the banking system, emphasizing its capital adequacy and the increase in capital ratios since the implementation of Basel III. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect the tone and precision of the message.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"banking system,\" \"Basel III,\" \"locally incorporated authorized institutions,\" and \"consolidated total capital ratio.\"\n- The structure and meaning of the sentences are preserved across all translations.\n- The use of \"Figure 6\" is consistent, which is important for reference.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"sufficiently abundant,\" which is slightly redundant and less natural than \"ample\" or \"well-capitalized.\"\n- The second junior translator uses \"sufficiently ample,\" which is also redundant and less idiomatic.\n- The third and sixth junior translators use \"ample\" and \"has ample capital,\" which is concise and natural.\n- The fourth junior translator uses \"reasonably ample,\" which introduces a nuance not present in the original text.\n- The fifth junior translator uses \"well-capitalized,\" which is a more formal and precise term in financial contexts, and also uses the abbreviation \"AIs\" for \"locally incorporated authorized institutions,\" which is acceptable if the term has been previously defined.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Well-capitalized\" is a standard term in financial reporting and conveys the intended meaning more precisely than \"ample\" or \"sufficiently abundant.\"\n- Using \"AIs\" as an abbreviation is appropriate if the term has been introduced earlier in the text, but since it is the first mention, using the full term \"locally incorporated authorized institutions\" is more reader-friendly.\n- The phrase \"capital ratios are at historical highs since the implementation of Basel III\" is more natural and grammatically correct than \"capital ratios have been at historical highs since...\" or \"capital ratios are at historical highs since...\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe banking system is well-capitalized, indicating that it has strong buffers to withstand potential shocks. Capital ratios are at historical highs since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate, but there are variations in style and formatting that can be refined for consistency and professionalism. The first translation uses \"AIs\" without explanation, which may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym. The second translation is fully spelled out but is somewhat wordy. The third and fourth translations use \"AIs\" and \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" respectively, with the latter being more formal and precise. The fifth and sixth translations are identical and follow a standard format with proper capitalization and spacing.\nThe best translation should balance clarity, conciseness, and formality. Using \"Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\" provides clarity, while \"AIs\" may be acceptable if the acronym has been previously defined in the document. Given the context, it is more appropriate to use the full term for the first mention to ensure clarity. Therefore, the most suitable translation is \"Figure 6: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions.\"\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Basel III leverage ratio,\" \"leverage ratio,\" \"banking system,\" and \"statutory minimum requirement.\" The only variation is in the use of \"regulation\" versus \"requirement\" for the term \"非風險為本規定,\" which is acceptable since both terms are valid in this context.\nThe translations differ slightly in prepositions and verb choices, such as \"became effective\" vs. \"took effect,\" \"designed to\" vs. \"aimed at,\" and \"within the banking system\" vs. \"in the banking system.\" These differences are stylistic and do not affect the meaning. However, \"took effect\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in regulatory contexts, making it a stronger choice.\nThe phrase \"significantly higher than\" is used consistently across translations, which is appropriate. The use of \"stood at\" in one translation adds a slight nuance of formality, but it is not necessary and may be redundant.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are correct and natural. However, the use of \"by the end of 2018\" is slightly more precise than \"as of the end of 2018\" or \"at the end of 2018,\" as it emphasizes the completion of the period.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"took effect,\" \"non-risk-based requirement,\" \"within the banking system,\" and \"by the end of 2018,\" with a slight preference for \"stood at\" to add a touch of formality.\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation within the banking system. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio stood at 8.0%, significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Incorporated Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and structure. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"Liquidity\" in all caps, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preference for lowercase unless it's an acronym. It also uses \"shocks from potential financial and economic pressures,\" which is slightly wordy.\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the ideal, using \"liquidity situation\" and \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\" appropriately. It also correctly uses \"Category 1 institutions\" with capitalization. However, it uses \"one-month period funds,\" which is slightly awkward.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2 but uses lowercase for \"liquidity coverage ratio\" and \"liquidity maintenance ratio,\" which is more natural in English unless the terms are defined as acronyms.\n4. **Translation 4** is well-structured and uses the correct acronyms (LCR and LMR) in parentheses. It also uses \"far exceeding\" and \"significantly higher than,\" which are both appropriate. However, it uses lowercase for \"category 1 institutions\" and \"category 2 institutions,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's use of \"Category 1 institutions\" with capitalization.\n5. **Translation 5** is very strong, using the correct acronyms and capitalization for \"Category 1 institutions\" and \"Category 2 institutions.\" It also uses \"far exceeding\" and \"significantly above,\" which are both appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"their\" instead of \"its\" in the first sentence, which is a grammatical error.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"Liquidity\" in all caps inconsistently and has a grammatical error with \"maintains steady\" instead of \"remains steady.\" It also uses lowercase for \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio\" and \"Liquidity Maintenance Ratio,\" which is less formal than using the acronyms in parentheses.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- Use the correct acronyms (LCR and LMR) in parentheses for the first mention of each term.\n- Capitalize \"Category 1 institutions\" and \"Category 2 institutions\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"banking system\" as the preferred translation for \"銀行體系.\"\n- Use \"remains robust\" or \"remains stable\" for \"維持穩健.\"\n- Use \"statutory minimum requirement\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness, such as using \"its\" instead of \"their\" when referring to the banking system.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe liquidity situation of the banking system remains stable, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering one-month funding), the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, significantly higher than the 90% statutory minimum requirement applicable in 2018. The average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also significantly above the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n-

rate weakened and approached the level of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. Nevertheless, the exchange and money markets for the Hong Kong dollar continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand significant shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"Currency Board system\" and \"monetary base\" consistently. It correctly uses \"foreign-exchange market\" and \"currency stability.\" However, it uses \"so that\" which is slightly less formal than \"keeping\" or \"ensuring.\"\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"Monetary Stability\" with a capital \"M,\" which is not standard in this context. It also uses \"Monetary Base\" with a capital \"M,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase \"monetary base.\" The phrase \"matching 100% of the changes\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, but it uses \"Monetary Base\" with a capital \"M,\" which is not ideal. It also uses \"any changes\" which is slightly less precise than \"if the monetary base changes.\"\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"Currency Board arrangements\" instead of \"Currency Board system,\" which is an acceptable alternative but less commonly used in this context. It also uses \"100 percent\" with a space, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"100%.\" The phrase \"matching the change in the Monetary Base by 100 percent\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Translation 5** is very strong, using \"Currency Board system\" and \"monetary base\" consistently. It uses \"correspondingly increased or decreased\" which is precise and natural. The only minor issue is the use of \"which entails\" which is slightly more formal than necessary.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, but it uses \"monetary base\" with a lowercase \"m\" and \"100 percent\" with a space, which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"mainly adopts\" which is slightly less formal than \"primarily employs.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- Use \"Currency Board system\" as it is the more standard term in this context.\n- Use \"monetary base\" with a lowercase \"m\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"100%\" without a space.\n- Use \"foreign-exchange market\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"currency stability\" with a lowercase \"c\" as it is more natural in this context.\n- Use \"correspondingly increased or decreased\" for precision and fluency.\n- Avoid capitalizing terms like \"Monetary Base\" unless it is a proper noun, which it is not in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the foreign-exchange market within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar. This monetary system primarily employs the Currency Board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide a minimum of 100% support for the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be correspondingly increased or decreased to match the changes in the monetary base by 100%.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued notes and coins  \n- The Aggregate Balance (the total balance of settlement accounts held by banks with the HKMA)  \n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Convertibility Undertaking,\" \"Aggregate Balance,\" and \"Convertibility Zone.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key economic mechanisms are clearly explained.\n- The use of \"strong-side CU\" and \"weak-side CU\" is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary options.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations are more verbose or repetitive. For example, the phrase \"thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone\" is repeated in several translations, which can be streamlined.\n- **Grammar and Word Choice:** Minor grammatical issues exist, such as \"the Hong Kong dollar interest rate\" (singular) versus \"Hong Kong dollar interest rates\" (plural), which should be consistent with the dictionary entry.\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"convertibility undertaking\" (lowercase) while others use \"Convertibility Undertaking\" (title case). The dictionary lists \"Convertibility Undertaking\" with a capital letter, so consistency is important.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone\" in multiple places.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"Convertibility Undertaking\" with title case and \"Aggregate Balance\" with title case.\n- Ensure that \"Hong Kong dollar interest rates\" is used consistently in plural form.\n- Streamline repetitive phrases to enhance readability.\n- Use precise verbs such as \"push up\" or \"raise\" for interest rates, and \"reduce\" or \"decrease\" for Aggregate Balance.\n- Ensure that the exchange rate ranges are clearly and concisely presented.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and precision of the original while ensuring fluency, grammatical correctness, and consistent terminology.\n---\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the Convertibility Undertaking. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side CU of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars from banks, increasing the Aggregate Balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of the Hong Kong dollar exceeds demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side CU of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing the Aggregate Balance and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of widening negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, which have driven carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which had been set at the 7.85 level since 2005, was triggered for the first time. Throughout the year, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times in 2018, with 13 triggers in April, 6 in May, and 8 in August. Despite this, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering around the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the tightening of interbank liquidity due to the approaching holidays, quarter-end, and year-end, which led to the unwinding of some carry trade positions. At the same time, to some extent, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported by the improvement in stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate\nThe original text is a simple label for a figure, likely from a report or presentation. The junior translators have provided several variations, with minor differences in capitalization and the use of singular vs. plural for \"exchange rate.\" The term \"Market Exchange Rate\" is correctly translated, and the year \"2018\" is properly placed. The use of a colon (\":\") is appropriate in this context to separate the figure label from the description.\nThe most consistent and grammatically correct translations are those that use \"Figure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate\" (translations 1, 3, and 4). These versions are fluent, natural, and follow standard conventions for labeling figures in English texts. The use of a colon is standard in such contexts, and the capitalization of \"Market Exchange Rate\" is appropriate as it functions as a title.\nTranslation 5 (\"Figure 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\") lacks a colon, which makes it slightly less formal and less clear in its structure. Translation 6 (\"Figure 1 2018 Market Exchange Rates\") uses the plural form \"Rates,\" which is not necessary unless the figure is showing multiple exchange rates. Since the original text uses the singular \"匯率,\" the singular form is more accurate.\nIn conclusion, the best translation would be \"Figure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate,\" as it is grammatically correct, follows standard formatting conventions, and accurately reflects the original Chinese text.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, the Aggregate Balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) decreased from HKD 12,268 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 11,362 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), purchased a total of HKD 1,035 billion at the weak-side CU rate of 7.85 in response to banks' requests. As a result, the Aggregate Balance fell from HKD 1,798 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 764 billion at the end of 2018. The total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) remained largely unchanged during the year. The Monetary Base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Aggregate Balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes stood at HK$113.62 billion.\n\nFigure 2: Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2018\n\n# Money Market\n\nDue to reduced interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking and market expectations of US interest rate hikes, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally rose in 2018. Driven by increased funding demand related to initial public offerings and seasonal liquidity needs, short-term interbank rates experienced greater fluctuations (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank rates remained largely below the Base Rate throughout 2018. Given the rising funding costs in the banking system, banks raised Best Lending Rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the upward adjustment of the target range for the US federal funds rate in late September.\n\nIn response to the four cumulative increases of 100 basis points in the target range for the US federal funds rate during the year, which was raised from 1.25 to 1.50 percent to 2.25 to 2.50 percent, the Base Rate was increased by a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, raising it from 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. The adjustment of the Base Rate was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the Base Rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the target range for the US federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or the average of the 5-day moving averages of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\nFigure 3: 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Discount Window borrowing,\" \"interest rate differentials,\" and \"money market\" or \"currency markets.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key financial concepts are preserved.\n- The numerical data and time references (e.g., \"mid-April,\" \"2017,\" \"2018\") are accurately translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"money market\" while others use \"currency markets.\" The original uses \"貨幣市場,\" which is more accurately translated as \"currency markets\" in the context of foreign exchange and interest rate dynamics.\n- **Fluency and Precision:** Some translations use \"discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate\" repeatedly, which is slightly repetitive. A more varied phrasing, such as \"discount for the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate\" or \"discount in the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate,\" could enhance readability.\n- **Tense and Flow:** A few translations use \"reached negative 620 points\" or \"reached -620 points,\" which is acceptable, but \"reached minus 620 points\" is more natural in financial contexts.\n- **Use of \"Discount Window\":** Some translations use \"discount window\" in lowercase, which is less formal. The term should be capitalized as \"Discount Window\" when referring to the official mechanism.\n- **\"Interest rate differentials\" vs. \"interest rate spreads\":** The original uses \"息差,\" which is best translated as \"interest rate differentials\" or \"interest rate spreads.\" While both are acceptable, \"interest rate differentials\" is more commonly used in financial literature.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"currency markets\" for \"貨幣市場.\"\n- Use \"Discount Window\" with a capital \"D\" and \"W\" when referring to the official mechanism.\n- Use \"interest rate differentials\" for \"息差\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Vary phrasing for \"discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate\" to avoid repetition.\n- Use \"minus 620 points\" instead of \"negative 620 points\" for a more natural financial expression.\n---\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate discount widened in the first four months, largely following the trend of the interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The 12-month forward points for the Hong Kong dollar reached minus 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed, the discount for the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate slightly decreased before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong currency markets continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: 2018 USD\/HKD Forward Points\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and clarity that can be refined.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"LERS,\" \"HKMA,\" \"CU,\" and \"Article IV Consultation.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points—such as the role of LERS in maintaining stability, the triggering of the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, and the IMF's support—are well conveyed.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Global Financial Crisis\" (GFC) in a way that may be redundant or less precise. For example, \"under numerous regional and even Global Financial Crisis tests\" (Translation 4) is awkward and unclear.\n- The term \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"CU\" without explanation, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.\n- Some translations use \"medium of payment and store of value\" or \"currency for payment and preservation,\" which are slightly less idiomatic than \"currency for payment and store of value.\"\n- The phrase \"the large financial services industry\" is used in some translations, but \"financial services industry\" is more concise and standard.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"CU\" is either spelled out or used consistently with its full name, depending on context.\n- Use \"currency for payment and store of value\" as a standard phrase.\n- Avoid redundancy, such as using \"Global Financial Crisis\" unnecessarily.\n- Ensure that the flow of the text is smooth and that the terminology is consistent with the dictionary.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented in 1983, has always been a crucial cornerstone for maintaining Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. It has demonstrated its ability to withstand significant shocks during multiple regional and global financial crises. Due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU), as part of the LERS design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable process of interest rate normalisation and a normal operation under the LERS. To enhance public understanding of the related operations and mechanisms of the LERS, the HKMA is committed to explaining the technical details of the system to the public and demonstrating the ability of Hong Kong's financial system to cope with shocks. The government is also resolute in maintaining the LERS. The stability of the exchange and money markets further reinforces public confidence in the government's commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and store of value. During the 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, stating that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, a pillar for maintaining stability, and helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the financial services industry.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintains supervision of banks' corporate, property-related, and Mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks. Banks hold a substantial amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs), which can be used through the Discount Window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The HKMA is always ready to provide additional liquidity by adjusting the issuance volume of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes to address the possibility of a sudden outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar. The HKMA also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to be prepared for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated as Backing Assets for the Monetary Base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching the Trigger Level. The ratio stood at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 5). Under the LERS, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all assets of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources provide a strong buffer to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Changes in the Backing Ratio in 2018\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC),\" \"Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC),\" \"HKMA,\" \"LERS,\" and \"Currency Board operations.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points—such as the topics discussed by the CBC in 2018—are well captured.\n- The use of terms like \"monetary and financial stability\" and \"foreign banks in Hong Kong\" is consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the CBC’s considerations included\" (Translation 5) or \"the potential impact of coordinated exits from unconventional monetary policies by multiple central banks\" (Translation 4), which, while grammatically correct, are less fluid than alternatives.\n- **Precision of Terms:** Translation 6 uses \"exploring\" instead of \"monitoring and examining,\" which is less precise than the original term \"監察和探討.\"\n- **Clarity of Concepts:** Some translations use \"theoretical framework\" (Translation 1) or \"theoretical framework of the LERS\" (Translation 4), which is acceptable, but \"theoretical framework\" may be more academic than necessary. \"Theoretical basis\" or \"theoretical aspects\" might be more natural in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the Currency Board Sub-Committee\" in Translation 3, which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original while ensuring clarity and fluency.\n- It should use the dictionary terms exactly as specified.\n- It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n- It should ensure that the meaning of the original is preserved without adding or omitting information.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC), under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2018, the CBC examined topics including the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of U.S. dollar loans to foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of Hong Kong dollar demand, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical aspects of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) since the implementation of three optimization measures. Minutes of the CBC meetings and the Currency Board operations reports submitted by the HKMA are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and uses the correct terminology from the dictionary. It is well-structured and fluent. However, it uses \"policy focus\" as a noun, which is slightly awkward in the phrase \"placed greater emphasis on policy focus.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"policy focus research\" instead of \"policy focus,\" which is more natural. It also uses \"host\" instead of \"organise\" in one instance, which is acceptable but slightly less formal.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"research\" instead of \"research programmes\" in the first sentence, which is less precise than the dictionary term. It also uses \"policy-related research\" instead of \"policy focus,\" which is slightly less aligned with the dictionary term but still acceptable. It also includes \"(HKMA)\" in parentheses, which is not necessary and slightly disrupts the flow.\n4. **Translation 4** is very close to the best version. It uses the correct terminology and structure. It also includes \"in 2016\" before the programme name, which is slightly more natural than placing it after.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"placed particular policy focus on research,\" which is awkward and not in line with the dictionary term. It also uses \"policy formulation\" instead of \"policy-making,\" which is less common in this context.\n6. **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 4 and is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"co-host\" instead of \"jointly host,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact dictionary terms where specified, maintain a formal and professional tone, and ensure clarity and fluency. Based on the above review, the best elements from the translations include:\n- Using \"research programmes\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"policy focus\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"policy-focused conferences\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"thematic research fellowship programme\" as per the dictionary.\n- Using \"HKMA\" without unnecessary parentheses.\n- Using \"organise\" or \"host\" consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continues to support research programmes in monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past four years, the HKIMR has placed greater emphasis on policy focus, as evidenced by its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. On one hand, the HKIMR has collaborated with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policy-focused conferences. On the other hand, it launched the thematic research fellowship programme in 2016 to support more research projects related to the HKMA's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, HKIMR invited a total of 16 research fellows and published 25 working papers. Throughout the year, HKIMR also hosted four international conference activities:  \n- The \"9th International Conference on the Chinese Economy,\" held in January, with the theme \"The Mainland’s Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" The conference was jointly organized by HKIMR, the Institute of Market Economy of the Development Research Centre of the State Council, and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, focusing on issues and risks related to the Mainland’s real estate market.  \n- The \"Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework\" conference, held in October and co-organized by HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The conference was one of the anniversary events marking the 20th anniversary of the BIS’s Asia Pacific Office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within the monetary policy framework.  \n- The \"Annual Central Bank Conference on the Microstructure of Financial Markets,\" held in November. The conference discussed theoretical research on financial market microstructure, empirical research results, and policy implications related to recent developments.  \n- The \"CEN workshop: A New Era for the Chinese Economy,\" held in November and co-organized by HKMA, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The workshop discussed pressing issues facing the Mainland’s economy and their impact on the global economy, with particular emphasis on policy issues relevant to central bank decision-makers. This was the first time the CEN workshop was held outside of Europe.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

banking sector remained stable in 2018. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ liquidity and credit risk management systems continued to be a key regulatory focus for the HKMA throughout the year. Given the ongoing rise in cyber-attacks and the broader adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management and operational resilience. The HKMA also issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks in May and began processing applications for virtual banking licenses. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen oversight of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products, promote barrier-free banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the HKMA continues to leverage new technologies and risk-based approaches to enhance the effectiveness of Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime. The HKMA has made satisfactory progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large exposure limits. In addition, the HKMA has strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to be committed to ensuring that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including the introduction of rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle facing the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the critical financial services required by the domestic economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their mode of operation, or even in extreme cases through disorderly failure. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks, responding to crises, and returning to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the financial system cannot be entirely risk-free, and Hong Kong's prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to ensure that if an authorized institution becomes unsustainable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution regime, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for several financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning Hong Kong resolution regime, it is necessary to enact resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the operational capacity of the HKMA to resolve non-viable authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the HKMA needs to adopt internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2018, the HKMA conducted a total of 187 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including AIs’ CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management, as well as the business strategies of AIs in response to fintech developments. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of AIs, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or their committees of AIs and followed up on the progress of AIs in implementing corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with AIs and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to conduct regular on-site examinations, complemented by thematic reviews, to assess areas identified as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA conducted a total of 392 on-site examinations and thematic reviews, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Other key areas include technology risk and operational risk management, as well as AML\/CFT controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Specialist review teams also conducted on-site examinations of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and MPF-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe original title, \"信貸增長及資產質素,\" is a straightforward heading likely used in a financial or banking context. The dictionary specifies that \"資產質素\" must be translated as \"asset quality,\" which is correctly applied in all translations. The term \"信貸增長\" is translated in various ways: \"Credit Growth,\" \"Loan growth,\" and \"Credit growth.\" While \"loan growth\" is a valid alternative, \"credit growth\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to the expansion of credit facilities or lending activities.\nAll translations correctly use \"asset quality\" as required by the dictionary. The only variation is in the translation of \"信貸增長,\" with \"credit growth\" being the most natural and widely accepted term in financial English. The use of \"Loan growth\" in one translation is less standard in this context and may be slightly less precise.\nThe formatting of the translations also varies slightly, with some including the \"#\" symbol, which is likely a formatting artifact and not part of the actual title. The most appropriate translation would be concise, professional, and consistent with standard financial terminology.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation is \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality.\"\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, all of them are largely accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\nThe first and second translations are nearly identical, with only minor differences in phrasing such as \"compared to an increase of 16.1%\" versus \"compared to a 16.1% increase.\" Both are grammatically sound and fluent.\nThe third translation stands out by using \"trade finance applications\" from the dictionary, which is a valid alternative. However, the phrase \"trade finance applications decreased\" may be slightly misleading, as \"trade finance\" itself refers to the financing of trade activities, not necessarily the number of applications. This could be interpreted as a decrease in the number of applications, which may not be the intended meaning.\nThe fourth and fifth translations are very similar, with the fourth using \"growth rate\" and the fifth using \"increase.\" Both are acceptable, though \"increase\" is more direct and commonly used in financial contexts.\nThe sixth translation uses \"loan volume\" instead of \"loan amount,\" which is a slight variation in terminology. \"Loan volume\" is acceptable but less common than \"loan amount\" in this context.\nThe most notable issue is the use of \"trade finance applications\" in the third translation, which may not be the best fit for the original term \"貿易融資.\" While \"trade finance applications\" is a valid alternative, \"trade finance\" is more direct and commonly used in financial reports to refer to the overall financing of trade activities.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"trade finance\" as per the dictionary, maintain the clarity and fluency of the first and second translations, and ensure that the terminology is consistent with financial reporting standards.\nFinal Translation:\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with the total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was mainly due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth in Loans and Advances\n\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, reporting a percentage increase in \"內地相關貸款\" (Mainland-related lending) and comparing it to the previous year's growth rate. The dictionary specifies that \"內地相關貸款\" must be translated as \"Mainland-related lending,\" which all junior translators have correctly used.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and accurately conveys the meaning. It uses \"HK$424.9 billion\" correctly, which is the standard way to express the amount in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. The structure is clear and concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Mainland-related lending\" and the reference to \"Table 3.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The number \"42,490 billion\" is incorrect. It should be \"424.9 billion\" (i.e., 42,490 * 10^8 = 424.9 * 10^9). This is a critical numerical error that changes the meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"424.9 billion HKD\" correctly and maintains the comparison to the 2017 growth rate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Mainland-related lending\" and \"Table 3.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same numerical error as the second translator: \"42,490 billion\" instead of \"424.9 billion.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is accurate, fluent, and uses the correct numerical value \"424.9 billion HKD.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Mainland-related lending\" and \"Table 3.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The numerical value is written as \"42,490 billion HK dollars,\" which is incorrect. Also, the phrase \"lower than the increase in 2017\" is slightly less precise than \"lower than the growth rate in 2017.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the correct numerical value. It should also maintain the comparison to the 2017 growth rate in a natural and precise way. The first and fifth translations are the most accurate, with the fifth being slightly more natural in structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nMainland-related lending increased by 1.4% to HK$424.9 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth in Mainland-related Lending\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"retail banks,\" \"Mainland-related lending,\" \"asset quality,\" \"banking sector,\" \"classified loan ratio,\" and \"authorized institutions\" (or \"AIs\"). However, there are subtle differences in tone and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of \"classified loan ratio\" is consistent across all translations.\n- The term \"Mainland-related lending\" is correctly used in all translations.\n- The term \"authorized institutions\" is consistently translated, with some using \"AIs\" as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The choice of \"remained stable\" versus \"remained robust\" for \"維持穩健\" is a point of variation. While both are acceptable, \"robust\" may be more appropriate in a financial context to convey strength and resilience.\n- Some translations use \"significantly lower than\" while others use \"much lower than\" or \"significantly below.\" These are all acceptable, but \"significantly lower than\" is more commonly used in formal financial reporting.\n- The phrase \"the banking sector as a whole\" appears in some translations, which is slightly more verbose than necessary. \"The overall banking sector\" is more concise and natural.\n- The use of \"while\" versus \"and\" in the final clauses can affect the flow. \"While\" is more appropriate when contrasting two related but distinct points.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"robust\" instead of \"stable\" to better reflect the nuance of \"維持穩健.\"\n- Use \"significantly lower than\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Use \"the overall banking sector\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"while\" to maintain a balanced contrast in the final clauses.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions remained robust in 2018. The classified loan ratio of retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, significantly lower than the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector declined from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding Mainland-related lending, the classified loan ratio of retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also decreased from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA strengthened its supervision to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management principles. In particular, the HKMA actively gained insights into the backgrounds and structures of large corporations, thereby enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risk. Additionally, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for corporate lending, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for property developers' loans, asset-backed financing, and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since October 2009 have enhanced the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to potential reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for new residential mortgage lending fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) also decreased from 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and Debt Servicing Ratio for New Residential Mortgage Lending\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"authorized institutions,\" \"Inherent Risk Assessment,\" \"Maturity Assessment,\" \"iCAST,\" \"information technology governance,\" and \"on-site examinations.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n- Most translations use natural English phrasing and maintain a formal tone appropriate for regulatory or policy-related texts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework\" (C-RAF) while others use \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF)\" or just \"C-RAF.\" The dictionary allows both, but consistency is key.\n- **\"Risk Information-Driven Cyber Attack Simulation Testing\" vs. \"iCAST\":** One translation uses the full phrase, while others use the acronym. The dictionary allows both, but \"iCAST\" is more concise and likely preferred in official contexts.\n- **\"Cybersecurity\" vs. \"Cyber Resilience\":** Some translations use \"cyber resilience\" while others use \"cybersecurity.\" The original text uses \"網絡防衛\" (cyber defense), which is best translated as \"cyber resilience\" in the context of the framework.\n- **\"Authorized Institutions\" vs. \"AIs\":** While \"AIs\" is a valid abbreviation, it may not be as clear to all readers. Using \"authorized institutions\" is more reader-friendly unless the context is highly technical.\n- **Tense and Timing:** Some translations use \"have completed\" while others use \"completed.\" The original text uses past tense, so \"have completed\" is more accurate.\n- **\"During the year\" vs. \"This year\":** Both are acceptable, but \"This year\" is more direct and commonly used in formal reports.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"C-RAF\" consistently as the acronym for \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\"\n- Use \"iCAST\" for \"風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試\" as it is the more concise and likely preferred term in official contexts.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" rather than \"AIs\" for clarity.\n- Use \"cyber resilience\" to align with the framework's focus on resilience rather than just security.\n- Use \"have completed\" to reflect the ongoing nature of the assessments.\n- Use \"This year\" for clarity and formality.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe technology risks faced by the banking sector remain relatively high. The HKMA introduced the \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework\" (C-RAF) in 2016. The first phase of implementation covered 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed three stages of assessment: Inherent Risk Assessment, Maturity Assessment, and (if applicable) iCAST. These assessments help authorized institutions identify areas requiring improvement and take corrective actions to enhance cyber resilience. Meanwhile, the HKMA has established a timetable for the second and third phases of implementation, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations, focusing on the cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Smart Banking,\" \"Banking Made Easy initiative,\" \"Regtech,\" and \"AML\/CFT surveillance technologies.\" However, some translations use \"financial compliance technology\" instead of \"regulatory technology\" or \"Regtech,\" which is less precise and not in line with the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first and second translations are the most fluent, with natural sentence structures and minimal grammatical errors. The third and fourth translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"online banking environment user experience\" in the fourth translation, which is redundant. The fifth and sixth translations are also fluent but vary slightly in phrasing.\n3. **Consistency**: The second and sixth translations are the most consistent in using \"Regtech\" and \"regulatory technology\" appropriately. The first and fifth translations use \"financial compliance technology\" in some instances, which is less precise.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they accurately reflect the context of Hong Kong's financial regulatory environment.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote Smart Banking and foster the development of fintech in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued the revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May. Additionally, under the \"Banking Made Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has streamlined the regulatory requirements related to remote onboarding, online finance, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. In September, the scope of the \"Banking Made Easy\" initiative was expanded to promote the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) by banks. The three new focus areas include AML\/CFT surveillance technologies, regulatory technology for prudent risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Yuen Kwok-hung, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, delivered a speech titled \"Regulatory Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018,\" hosted by the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs U.S. monetary policy continues to normalize, the HKMA has strengthened its oversight of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risk. This year, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to assess the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of U.S. dollar liquidity, as well as their internal capacity to conduct liquidity stress tests. In addition, the HKMA has been monitoring the compliance of authorized institutions with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirements that took effect in January.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"market risk management,\" \"on-site examinations,\" \"Foreign Exchange Global Code,\" \"over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives,\" \"Margining and risk mitigation standards,\" and \"authorized institutions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"targeted,\" \"specialized,\" or \"thematic\" to describe the nature of the examinations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"authorized institutions\" consistently and includes \"treasury operations,\" which is accurate. However, it uses \"non-central counterparty\" instead of \"non-central settlement\" or \"non-central clearing,\" which is slightly off from the original term \"非中央結算.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"AIs\" as an abbreviation for \"authorized institutions,\" which is acceptable but may not be as clear for all readers. It also uses \"financial services\" instead of \"treasury operations,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"non-central clearing\" correctly and includes \"treasury operations,\" but the phrase \"specialized on-site examinations on\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"non-central clearing\" correctly and includes \"treasury operations,\" but it uses \"financial services\" instead of \"treasury operations,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly places \"Margining and risk mitigation standards\" before \"Foreign Exchange Global Code,\" which changes the intended emphasis. It also uses \"financial businesses\" instead of \"treasury operations.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"non-central settlement,\" which is the most accurate translation of \"非中央結算.\" However, it uses \"in order to assess how authorized institutions comply\" instead of \"to assess the compliance of authorized institutions,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"non-central settlement\" for \"非中央結算\" as it is the most precise term.\n- Use \"treasury operations\" instead of \"financial services\" or \"financial businesses\" for accuracy.\n- Maintain the structure \"to assess the compliance of authorized institutions with new international standards in their treasury operations\" for clarity and formality.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"Margining and risk mitigation standards\" is correctly placed after \"Foreign Exchange Global Code\" to reflect the original emphasis.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe HKMA, in addition to reviewing the market risk management of debt securities portfolios of authorized institutions, also conducted specialized on-site examinations focusing on the Foreign Exchange Global Code and the margining and risk mitigation standards for non-central settlement over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, to assess the compliance of authorized institutions with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# AML\/CFT\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report,\" \"Hong Kong banking sector,\" \"HKMA,\" \"payment and trading hub,\" \"AML\/CFT policy statement,\" \"international financial centres,\" and \"anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that affect fluency and clarity.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure that mirrors the original Chinese text.\n- Proper use of formal and professional language appropriate for a government report.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Some translations use \"Financial Services\" with a capital \"F\" inconsistently, which should be lowercase unless it's part of a proper noun.\n- The use of \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"C\" is inconsistent; the dictionary allows for \"international financial centres\" in lowercase.\n- Some translations use \"stem from\" or \"arise from\" instead of \"come from,\" which is slightly more formal but not incorrect.\n- The phrase \"with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness\" or \"with the goal of enhancing the capacity\" is slightly repetitive across translations and could be more varied.\nImprovements could include:\n- Ensuring consistent capitalization of terms like \"Financial Services\" and \"International Financial Centre.\"\n- Using a more varied set of verbs to express causation (e.g., \"reflect,\" \"stem from,\" \"arise from,\" \"originate from\").\n- Ensuring that the final sentence is concise and avoids redundancy in the phrasing of the policy's objectives.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and formality of the original, use the dictionary terms accurately, and ensure consistent and natural English phrasing.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report, published by the government in April, points out that the Hong Kong banking sector faces a high money laundering threat, similar to other international financial centres, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats facing Hong Kong stem not only from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illegal proceeds from corruption abroad, fraud by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong's status as a payment and trading hub. With the assistance of the HKMA, the government formulated an AML\/CFT policy statement outlining responses to these threats, aiming to enhance the capacity of the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime while also attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"AML\/CFT,\" \"authorized institutions (AIs),\" and \"corporate beneficial ownership.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key legal concepts are preserved.\n- The use of \"AML\/CFT\" is well-integrated in most translations, though some use the full term \"anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism\" for clarity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** Some translations use \"grant\" or \"provide\" for \"賦予靈活性,\" which is acceptable, but \"grant\" is more formal and precise in legal contexts.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat \"AML\/CFT\" unnecessarily, which can be distracting.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The use of \"thereby comprehensively strengthening\" is repetitive and can be rephrased for better flow.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations mix \"AML\/CFT\" with the full term, which can be inconsistent. It is better to use one form consistently unless the full term is necessary for clarity.\n- **\"認可機構\" as \"authorized institutions\" or \"AIs\":** While both are correct, \"authorized institutions\" is more formal and appropriate in legal texts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"grant\" for \"賦予\" to maintain a formal tone.\n- Use \"AML\/CFT\" consistently, with the full term only when necessary for clarity.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is varied and avoids repetition.\n- Maintain a formal and precise tone, as is expected in legal documents.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"corporate beneficial ownership\" is used consistently and correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on March 1, introducing amendments that grant flexibility in verifying customer identities to align with the development of authorized institutions using technology to facilitate customer account openings. The new legislation also broadens the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to assume AML\/CFT responsibilities, thereby comprehensively strengthening the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime. These amendments, together with the revisions made under the Companies Ordinance to enhance transparency of corporate beneficial ownership, assist authorized institutions in carrying out their AML\/CFT obligations.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with authorized institutions (AIs) regarding anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) policies and regulatory approaches, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a new unit titled \"Regulatory Approach to AML\/CFT\" under the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) in October, alongside the revised \"AML\/CFT Guidelines (Applicable to Authorized Institutions)\" to enable more effective implementation of the risk-based approach and reduce barriers for AIs in adopting new technologies under the AML\/CFT regime.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, which is a critical requirement. However, there are subtle variations in tone, word choice, and sentence structure that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms (e.g., \"HKMA,\" \"HKAB,\" \"FMLIT\").\n- Accurate translation of the core message regarding the importance of information sharing in the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime.\n- Proper use of tenses and time references (e.g., \"at the end of 2018,\" \"in early 2019\").\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"information exchange\" instead of \"information sharing,\" which is less idiomatic in this context.\n- The use of \"substantial\" versus \"tangible\" or \"substantive\" is contextually interchangeable, but \"tangible\" may be more precise in this context.\n- The phrase \"has already achieved\" is slightly more emphatic than necessary and may not be the most neutral or formal tone for official reporting.\n- The use of \"is expected to be completed\" is slightly less direct than \"will be completed,\" which is more definitive and aligns better with the tone of the original text.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and formality of the original while ensuring natural English phrasing and precise terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nInformation sharing plays an increasingly important role in the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime. With the support of the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector has actively participated in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) and has achieved tangible results. The review of the FMLIT pilot program commenced at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

accurate but vary in fluency, punctuation, and stylistic choice. The first and second translations are nearly identical, with the only difference being the presence of a period in the first. The third translation includes a hashtag, which is not appropriate in formal writing. The fourth translation uses \"Status as an International Financial Centre,\" which is grammatically correct and stylistically more natural than \"status\" as a noun. The fifth and sixth translations are also correct but use a slightly more formal structure.\nThe most notable issue across all translations is the use of \"status\" as a noun. While grammatically correct, \"status\" can be vague and less precise in this context. A more natural and commonly used phrasing in formal English would be \"position\" or \"role\" when referring to a city's standing in the global financial system. Additionally, the dictionary provides multiple acceptable translations for \"國際金融中心,\" including \"International Financial Centre,\" \"IFC,\" and \"international financial centre.\" The use of \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"C\" is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to a specific designation.\nThe best possible translation would use \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"C,\" avoid unnecessary punctuation like hashtags, and use a more natural phrasing such as \"status\" or \"position\" depending on the intended tone.\nHong Kong’s position as an International Financial Centre.\n\nConsolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre is one of the HKMA's primary responsibilities. Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries have made good progress this year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) serving as the best example.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the optimization of the mutual access schemes and the development of the Greater Bay Area have reinforced Hong Kong's role as a gateway to Mainland China and as an offshore renminbi business hub. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"mutual access schemes,\" \"Greater Bay Area,\" \"offshore renminbi business hub,\" and \"gateway to Mainland China.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of synonyms like \"solidified,\" \"consolidated,\" \"secure,\" and \"thriving\" effectively conveys the intended meaning of the original Chinese terms.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the launch of optimized measures\" or \"the introduction of optimized measures,\" which are not as concise as \"optimized measures for.\"\n- The phrase \"the global offshore renminbi business hub\" appears in one translation, but the dictionary only lists \"offshore renminbi business hub,\" so the addition of \"global\" is unnecessary and not in line with the dictionary.\n- The use of \"the territory\" and \"the city\" to refer to Hong Kong is acceptable but less natural than simply using \"Hong Kong.\"\n- Some translations use \"has also become more solidified\" or \"has also become more solid,\" which are grammatically correct but could be more concise or natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"optimized measures for\" instead of \"the launch of optimized measures\" or \"the introduction of optimized measures.\"\n- Avoid adding unnecessary adjectives like \"global\" when the dictionary does not include them.\n- Use \"Hong Kong\" consistently instead of \"the territory\" or \"the city.\"\n- Choose more natural phrasing such as \"has become more consolidated\" or \"has become more secure\" depending on context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nOptimized measures for the mutual access schemes between Mainland China and Hong Kong's capital markets, along with the development of the Greater Bay Area, have further strengthened Hong Kong's unique position as the gateway to Mainland China. Hong Kong's status as an offshore renminbi business hub has also become more consolidated, with thriving renminbi financial activities in the territory.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is committed to exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres, and the green bond market. The HKMA has also strengthened its marketing campaign to promote Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. On the international front, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in related international initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub, the HKMA is committed to implementing seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at promoting the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment sectors. Key progress made this year regarding these seven Smart Banking measures includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the Faster Payment System (FPS), fully connecting different banks and stored value facilities (collectively referred to as \"e-wallets\").\n- Released the Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework for the banking sector and promoted industry implementation of Open APIs.\n- Enhanced fintech research and talent training.\n- Strengthened cross-border fintech collaboration.\n- Revised the Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks and processed applications for virtual bank licences.\n- Smooth operation of the upgraded version of the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS 2.0); and\n- Expanded the \"Banking Made Easy\" initiative to promote the adoption of regulatory technology by banks.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, emphasizing the collaborative role of the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the HKMA’s banking departments in implementing certain measures. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing, verb choice, and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"金融科技促進辦公室\" as \"Fintech Facilitation Office,\" \"FFO\" as \"FFO,\" and \"金管局\" as \"HKMA.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate prepositions and structures such as \"under the HKMA\" or \"within the HKMA.\"\n- The use of \"promoting the implementation\" or \"implementing\" is accurate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"plays a vital role\" or \"plays a key role,\" which are slightly more emotive than the original, which uses \"擔當重要角色\" (plays an important role). While not incorrect, \"important\" is more neutral and formal, aligning better with the tone of the original.\n- The phrase \"driving the implementation\" in Translation 5 is slightly more dynamic than the original, which uses \"推動落實\" (promote the implementation). \"Promoting the implementation\" is more precise.\n- Some translations use \"various banking departments\" while others use \"banking departments.\" Both are acceptable, but \"various\" adds a slight nuance of diversity, which may or may not be intended.\n- The phrase \"in conjunction with\" in Translation 4 is slightly more formal and precise than \"together with,\" which is also acceptable but less formal.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"plays an important role\" to match the neutral tone of the original.\n- Use \"promoting the implementation\" to align with the original’s phrasing.\n- Use \"the HKMA’s various banking departments\" to reflect the collaborative nature of the departments.\n- Maintain consistency in prepositions and phrasing for clarity and formality.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe HKMA's Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the HKMA's various banking departments, plays an important role in promoting the implementation of the aforementioned measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimization measures under the mutual access schemes between Mainland China and Hong Kong's capital markets, Hong Kong's unique position as a gateway to Mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement model for Bond Connect, along with the State Council's announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors in the Mainland's debt securities market, has further enhanced the efficiency and appeal of the scheme. The HKMA has also closely collaborated with Mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial facilitation measures, facilitating individuals and businesses living, working, and operating in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong's offshore renminbi business continues to thrive, with the renminbi deposit pool rising 6% year-on-year to RMB 657.7 billion; the renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system achieved an average daily transaction value of RMB 101.01 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Pilot Bond Grant Scheme,\" \"Qualifying Debt Instrument scheme,\" and \"Green Finance.\" However, some translations use \"debt securities\" instead of \"bonds\" in the phrase \"institutions issuing debt securities in Hong Kong for the first time,\" which is slightly more formal and less aligned with the original's use of \"債券.\"\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first, second, and sixth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The third and fifth translations have minor grammatical issues, such as \"working closely with the government to revise legislative changes\" (should be \"to make legislative changes\" or \"to enact legislative changes\"). The fourth translation uses \"works closely\" instead of \"works closely with,\" which is slightly awkward.\n3. **Consistency and Style**: The first and sixth translations are the most consistent in tone and style, using formal and professional language appropriate for a government or financial institution. The second and fourth translations are also strong, but the use of \"communicating Hong Kong's advantages\" is slightly less direct than \"promoting Hong Kong's advantages.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial and governmental terminology. However, the use of \"Green Finance\" with a capital \"F\" in some translations is more consistent with the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote Hong Kong’s bond market development, the HKMA has implemented the \"Pilot Bond Grant Scheme\" proposed in the Budget initiative, providing funding to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong. It is also working closely with the government to enact legislative changes, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemptions under the Qualifying Debt Instrument scheme. The HKMA has also intensified its market promotion activities, promoting Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, including organizing numerous large-scale and thematic outreach events to position Hong Kong as a hub for Green Finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA leads several regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation of the FSB, as a member of the Supervision and Implementation Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and as Chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Hong Kong as an international financial centre,\" \"CMU,\" \"Bond Connect,\" \"Mainland debt securities,\" and \"HKTR.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and aligns with the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain a formal tone suitable for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"security and efficient operation\" and \"system availability rate of 100%,\" which are accurate but slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"underpin\" and \"facilitate the settlement,\" which are good, but it omits \"handling bank-to-bank transactions\" and \"system availability rate.\"\n- **Translation 3** is fluent and accurate, but it uses \"custody of Mainland debt securities\" instead of \"hold,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal, using \"on behalf of\" and \"central securities depositories (CSDs),\" but it adds \"Northbound\" with a capital letter unnecessarily.\n- **Translation 5** is similar to 4 but omits the \"(CSDs)\" abbreviation, which is acceptable but less precise.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"system availability rate\" and \"CMU system,\" which is redundant since \"CMU\" is already defined.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"safe and efficient operation\" instead of \"security and efficient operation\" for better fluency.\n- Ensure \"system availability rate\" is used consistently.\n- Use \"on behalf of\" for clarity in the context of holding securities.\n- Maintain the correct use of abbreviations like \"CSDs\" when appropriate.\n- Ensure that \"Bond Connect Northbound\" is written with a lowercase \"n\" unless it is a proper noun.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and clarity in financial terminology.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In 2018, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories (CSDs) in the Mainland, the CMU continues to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect northbound transactions and holds Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the HKMA designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), bringing their operations under HKMA supervision. As of now, the number of designated retail payment systems under HKMA supervision has increased to six. The HKMA also supervises 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees. These licensees are actively launching new products and services, striving to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the scope of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Smart Banking,\" \"banking sector,\" and \"financial ecosystem.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of synonyms such as \"initiatives,\" \"measures,\" \"opportunities,\" and \"transformation\" is appropriate and reflects the nuances of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"During the year\" vs. \"this year\" vs. \"within the year\":** While all are grammatically correct, \"this year\" is more natural and concise in English.\n- **\"Integration of banking and technology\" vs. \"convergence of banking and technology\" vs. \"combination of banking and technology\":** \"Integration\" is the most precise and commonly used term in this context, especially in policy or regulatory discussions.\n- **\"Reach a higher level\" vs. \"elevate to a higher level\" vs. \"take the banking sector to a higher level\":** \"Take the banking sector to a higher level\" is more dynamic and idiomatic in English.\n- **\"Significant,\" \"enormous,\" \"vast,\" \"tremendous\":** These adjectives are all acceptable, but \"significant\" is more neutral and widely used in formal writing, making it the most appropriate choice for this context.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should aim for clarity, fluency, and natural phrasing while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms. The best version would combine the most natural phrasing from the translations, using \"this year\" instead of \"during the year\" or \"within the year,\" \"integration\" instead of \"convergence\" or \"combination,\" and \"take the banking sector to a higher level\" for a more dynamic expression.\n---\nThe HKMA announced seven measures to promote Smart Banking in September 2017, aiming to take the banking sector to a higher level and seize the significant opportunities brought by the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress this year in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# Faster Payment System (FPS)\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"零售銀行\" as \"retail banks,\" \"儲值支付工具\" as either \"SVFs\" or \"stored value facilities,\" and \"轉數快\" as \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information—such as the system's launch date, functionality, and the number of participating institutions—is preserved across all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"real-time,\" \"cross-bank,\" and \"instant\" is appropriate and aligns with the intended meaning of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"stored value facilities\" while others use \"SVFs.\" While both are acceptable, consistency is important for clarity and professionalism. \"SVFs\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** The first and third translations use \"the Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"the 'Faster Payment System' (FPS)\" respectively, which is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"the Faster Payment System (FPS)\" or \"FPS\" with the full name introduced once.\n- **Word Choice:** The sixth translation uses \"account linking services\" instead of \"account binding services.\" While both are similar, \"binding\" is more precise in the context of financial systems.\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** Some translations, such as the first and third, use phrases like \"enabling bank and stored value facilities users\" or \"enabling banks and stored value facility users,\" which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"SVFs\" or \"stored value facilities\" throughout the translation.\n- Use \"FPS\" or \"Faster Payment System\" consistently, introducing the acronym after the full name.\n- Replace \"account linking services\" with \"account binding services\" for accuracy.\n- Streamline sentence structures to enhance fluency and reduce redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) was successfully launched in September, enabling users of banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) to make real-time cross-bank transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi anytime and anywhere, simply by entering the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value facilities operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\n\"轉數快\"在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\nThe original text provides factual data about the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) in Hong Kong, including registration numbers, transaction volumes, and monetary values. The dictionary specifies that \"轉數快\" must be translated as either \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS,\" and the best choice depends on context and clarity.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and provides accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population,\" which is slightly awkward phrasing. Also, \"value exceeding HKD 104.9 billion\" is slightly inconsistent with the original's \"逾1,049億港元.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Faster Payment System\" and accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population proportion\" is redundant and awkward. Also, \"total amount of over 104.9 billion Hong Kong dollars\" is slightly inconsistent with the original's \"逾1,049億港元.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly states \"20 million registrations\" and \"48 million transactions,\" which are 10 times higher than the original. This is a critical error.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"CNY 27.5 billion\" is incorrect; the original states \"27.5億元人民幣,\" which is \"RMB 2.75 billion.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"value of over HKD 104.9 billion\" is slightly inconsistent with the original's \"逾1,049億港元.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and accurate figures.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HK$104.9 billion\" is slightly inconsistent with the original's \"1,049億港元\" (which is \"HKD 104.9 billion\").\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Accurately reflect the original figures: 2 million registrations, 4.8 million transactions, HKD 104.9 billion, and RMB 2.75 billion.\n- Use natural English phrasing, such as \"representing 27% of Hong Kong's population\" or \"accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population.\"\n- Ensure consistency in currency abbreviations: \"HKD\" for Hong Kong dollars and \"RMB\" for Chinese yuan.\n**Improved Translation:**\n\"Faster Payment System (FPS) has received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, representing 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and emphasis that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Accuracy and Terminology**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Common QR Code Standard for Retail Payments,\" \"Hong Kong Common QR Code (HKQR),\" \"mobile application,\" \"SMEs,\" and \"payment schemes.\" This is a strength across all translations.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound. However, some variations in sentence structure and phrasing affect fluency. For example, the phrase \"making it convenient for businesses\" in Translation 3 is slightly less direct than \"facilitating merchants\" in Translation 4.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The original text emphasizes that the application is \"the world's first\" and \"convenient for SMEs.\" Some translations use \"facilitating\" or \"making it convenient,\" which are both acceptable, but \"facilitating\" may be more formal and precise in this context.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard business terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n5. **Clarity and Emphasis**: Translation 6 stands out for its clear emphasis on the novelty of the application with \"marking a global first,\" which effectively highlights the innovation. However, it slightly changes the structure of the sentence, which may affect the flow.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA launched the Common QR Code Standard for Retail Payments and the related mobile application \"Hong Kong Common QR Code\" (HKQR) in the same month. It is the world's first mobile application to integrate multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, facilitating merchants, especially SMEs, to accept payment schemes from different payment service providers using a single QR code, without needing to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen APIs refer to the liberalisation of banking data by allowing third-party service providers access to relevant banking information, thereby better and more conveniently integrating banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment through a single system. To promote the development and provision of Open APIs in the banking sector, the HKMA released the Open API Framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various Open API functions in four phases. As of the end of January 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 Open API endpoints in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Scientific Research and Talent Development\n\nBased on the provided translations, several observations can be made regarding translation quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness. All translations generally convey the core message accurately and use the correct dictionary terms. However, there are variations in phrasing, sentence structure, and clarity that affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the English output.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of dictionary terms such as \"HKMA,\" \"eTradeConnect,\" \"we.trade,\" \"DLT,\" \"Memorandum of Understanding,\" and \"Global Trade Connectivity Network.\"\n- Accurate translation of key concepts like \"distributed ledger technology,\" \"trade finance platform,\" and \"proof of concept.\"\n- Generally clear and coherent sentence structures that maintain the original meaning.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the results of the HKMA-led trade finance proof of concept\" (Translation 3), which could be more naturally phrased as \"the results of the HKMA-led proof of concept for trade finance.\"\n- The phrase \"conduct a proof of concept for interconnectivity between the two platforms\" (Translation 2) is slightly less natural than \"conduct a proof of concept for interoperability between the two platforms.\"\n- Some translations use \"automating trade finance applications\" (Translation 3) instead of \"automating trade finance processes,\" which is more consistent with the original text.\n- The use of \"simultaneously\" in some translations (e.g., Translation 1) is redundant and can be omitted for better flow.\n- The phrase \"the trade finance concept validation results\" (Translation 6) is not as idiomatic as \"the results of the trade finance proof of concept.\"\nImprovements would focus on:\n- Ensuring consistent and natural phrasing, particularly around technical terms and processes.\n- Using more idiomatic expressions such as \"interoperability\" instead of \"interconnectivity\" or \"integration.\"\n- Maintaining parallel structure and clarity in sentences, especially when describing the platform's purpose and the consortium's activities.\n- Ensuring that the timeline and sequence of events are clearly conveyed without redundancy.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the phrasing for fluency and clarity.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nBuilding on the results of the HKMA-led proof of concept for trade finance, a consortium of Hong Kong banks launched the trade finance platform \"eTradeConnect\" in October, based on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. As of the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium. In October, \"eTradeConnect\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a proof of concept for interoperability between the two platforms. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities for \"eTradeConnect\" to connect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connectivity Network.\"\n\nMr. Norman Chan, the Chief Executive of the HKMA (left), at the eTradeConnect launch ceremony.\n\nTo cultivate more fintech talent, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (HKASTRI) in January to launch the upgraded version of the \"Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme\" (FCAS 2.0). FCAS 2.0 comprises four initiatives tailored for young professionals at different stages of their career development. Over 200 students have benefited from the scheme.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA Chief Executive\" and \"Hong Kong Science Park.\" However, \"Lam Ka-lei\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Lin Jiali\" or \"Lin Jia Li.\" Also, \"Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute\" is a more accurate name than \"Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute\" used here.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is fluent and uses the correct terms from the dictionary. However, \"Lin Jiali\" is misspelled as \"Lin Jiali\" (should be \"Lin Jia Li\" or \"Lin Jiali\"). Also, \"Hong Kong Institute of Applied Technology\" is not the correct name; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several errors. \"Lin Jalih\" is a misspelling of \"Lin Jiali.\" Also, \"Hong Kong Applied Science Institute\" is not the correct name; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute.\" Additionally, \"Wong Ka Keung\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Wong Hap-keung.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA Chief Executive\" and \"Hong Kong Science Park.\" However, \"Lam Ka-lei\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Lin Jiali.\" Also, \"far left\" and \"far right\" are not consistent with the original text, which specifies \"left one\" and \"right one.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate in terms of structure. However, \"Lin Ka-leung\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Lin Jiali.\" Also, \"Albert Wong\" is not the correct name; the correct name is \"Wong Hap-keung.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA Chief Executive\" and \"Hong Kong Science Park.\" However, \"Lam Ka-lik\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Lin Jiali.\" Also, \"Wong Kew-chung\" is likely incorrect; the correct name is \"Wong Hap-keung.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Ensure that all names are correctly spelled and match the original Chinese names.\n- Use the exact terms from the dictionary, such as \"HKMA Chief Executive\" and \"Hong Kong Science Park.\"\n- Maintain consistency in the positioning of individuals (e.g., \"second from the left\" and \"first from the right\").\n- Ensure that the full name of the institution is used: \"Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nHKMA Chief Executive Mr. Norman Chan (second from the left) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony with Cyberport Chairman Dr. Lin Jiali (first from the left), Chairman of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Mr. Wang Mingxin (second from the right), and Chief Executive of Hong Kong Science Park Mr. Wong Hap-keung (first from the right).\n\n# Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Office of Financial Development Service (OFDS) under the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has continued to strengthen its fintech collaboration with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA's sponsorship of the Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme, which provided 50 students with a six-week internship at several renowned companies in Shenzhen to experience the local fintech ecosystem; additionally, the HKMA co-hosted the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award for the second time with the OFDS.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA (second from the right), conversed with the first batch of Shenzhen fintech summer interns.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) signing fintech collaboration agreements with several international financial regulators in 2018. The translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in structure and terminology that affect clarity and consistency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"FINMA\" without the full name, which is acceptable but lacks the full name for clarity. The use of \"a fintech collaboration agreement\" is correct, and the sentence structure is clear.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses the full name \"Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority\" instead of the acronym \"FINMA,\" which is more formal and may be preferred in official contexts. The use of \"agreements\" (plural) is incorrect, as the original text refers to a single agreement.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Correctly uses both the full name and the acronym for FINMA in parentheses, which adds clarity. The use of \"a fintech collaboration agreement\" is accurate, and the placement of the purpose clause (\"to promote fintech collaboration\") is natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Similar to the first, but uses \"FINMA\" without the full name. The use of \"a fintech collaboration agreement\" is correct, and the sentence is fluent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"agreements\" (plural) incorrectly, as the original text refers to a single agreement. The placement of the purpose clause is slightly awkward with a comma before \"to promote fintech collaboration.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses the full name for \"Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority\" and correctly uses \"agreement\" (singular). The sentence is fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct form of the term \"fintech collaboration\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use the appropriate English name for each regulatory body, either the full name or the accepted acronym.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy, particularly in the use of singular vs. plural forms.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent sentence structure.\nThe third junior translator's version is the most accurate and well-structured, as it includes both the full name and acronym for FINMA, uses the correct singular form \"agreement,\" and places the purpose clause naturally.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA also signed a fintech collaboration agreement with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018 to promote fintech collaboration.\n\nIn reviewing the translations, several observations can be made. First, all translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" for \"全球金融創新網絡,\" which aligns with the dictionary. However, the term \"網絡\" is translated as \"cyber space\" in translations 1 and 3, which is incorrect. \"網絡\" in this context refers to a \"network\" of institutions, not \"cyber space.\" This is a critical error that affects the clarity and accuracy of the translation.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, translations 2, 4, 5, and 6 are more natural and grammatically sound. Translation 1 and 3 suffer from the incorrect use of \"cyber space,\" which disrupts the intended meaning. Translation 2 uses \"network\" correctly and maintains a formal yet clear tone. Translation 4 and 6 are also strong, with minor differences in phrasing such as \"regulators\" versus \"regulatory authorities\" and \"firms\" versus \"companies.\" These are stylistic choices and do not affect the accuracy.\nTranslation 5 uses \"plan\" instead of \"initiative,\" which is slightly less precise than \"initiative\" in this context. \"Initiative\" better conveys the proactive nature of the program.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would retain the correct terminology, use \"network\" for \"網絡,\" and maintain a formal yet fluent tone. It should also use \"initiative\" to reflect the proactive nature of the program and \"companies\" or \"firms\" as appropriate.\nImproved Translation:\nIn August, the HKMA, along with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions, announced the Global Financial Innovation Network initiative. The network aims to provide innovative companies with a more effective way to interact with regulators and to promote cooperation among regulators on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"financial inclusion,\" \"HKMA,\" \"digital banking,\" and \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone and nuance that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms.\n- Accurate rendering of the main message: the introduction of virtual banks in Hong Kong and their impact on fintech, digital banking, and financial inclusion.\n- Proper use of tenses and grammatical structures.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Some translations use \"momentum\" while others use \"impetus\" or \"new energy.\" While all are acceptable, \"momentum\" is more commonly used in this context.\n- The phrase \"bring novel experiences\" or \"bring a fresh experience\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"bring new experiences\" or \"offer new experiences.\"\n- The use of \"revised\" before \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" is present in some translations but not all. The original text mentions it as a \"修訂本,\" which implies a revised version, so including \"revised\" is appropriate.\n- The phrase \"Following public consultation\" is slightly more formal than \"After public consultation,\" but both are acceptable.\n- The use of \"approximately\" versus \"about\" is a matter of style, but both are correct.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining the phrasing for natural English flow and consistency in terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nIntroducing virtual banks will add new momentum to Hong Kong's fintech applications and bring new experiences to digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and SMEs, and therefore also help promote financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the HKMA issued the revised \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May and received about 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of FSS has steadily increased this year. To assist in establishing the regulatory technology ecosystem, FSS was opened to Regtech projects starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved to use the FSS for testing, of which 28 had completed their trials and the relevant products had subsequently been launched in the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases seeking to use the \"FSS Chatroom\" to obtain regulatory feedback during the early stages of fintech project development. Approximately 70% of these cases came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year

risk factors, including the continued normalization of U.S. interest rates leading to tighter financial conditions, escalating trade tensions between major economies, and the rise of populism and heightened geopolitical risks in various parts of the world. Global stock markets generally declined, and U.S. Treasury yields also rose with the four interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Amid the rising U.S. interest rates, the dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe political and economic pressures domestically, leading to significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of the delegation by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe original sentence is straightforward and formal, stating that the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) sets investment objectives for the Exchange Fund. All six translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" However, there are subtle differences in verb tense and formality that affect the overall tone and accuracy.\nThe first junior translator uses \"establishes,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal and less commonly used in this context compared to \"sets.\" The second and sixth translators use \"has set,\" which introduces a completed action in the past, implying that the objectives are no longer being set, which may not be accurate if the objectives are ongoing or current. The third, fourth, and fifth translators use \"sets,\" which is the most neutral and appropriate verb in this context, as it reflects a current, ongoing responsibility of the committee.\nIn terms of fluency and natural English usage, \"sets\" is the most commonly used verb in formal statements of this nature, especially in official or institutional contexts. It conveys a present, active role without implying completion or past action. Therefore, the best choice is to use \"sets\" as the verb.\nBased on this review, the most accurate and natural translation would be:\n**The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:**\n\n(a) Safeguarding capital;  \n(b) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) Ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) Seeking investment returns as much as possible under the premise of complying with items (a) to (c) above, in order to protect the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a legal or financial context. The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" and \"target asset mix\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentence is largely preserved, with the main clause indicating that the objectives have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset mix.\n- The use of \"take into account\" and \"consider\" is appropriate, though \"comprehensively\" adds a nuance of thoroughness that may be more suitable in a formal context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"targets\" instead of \"objectives,\" which is less precise in this context. \"Objectives\" better aligns with the formal tone of the original.\n- The second translation uses \"purposes\" instead of \"objectives,\" which is slightly less precise in a legal or financial context.\n- The third and fifth translations use \"objectives\" and \"consider,\" which is accurate but slightly less formal than \"take into account.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"comprehensively consider,\" which is fluent and formal but slightly less direct than \"take into account.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"comprehensively take into account,\" which is the most precise and formal phrasing among the options.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Objectives\" is more appropriate than \"targets\" in a formal legal or financial context.\n- \"Take into account\" is more precise and formal than \"consider.\"\n- \"Comprehensively\" adds a nuance of thoroughness that aligns well with the original's emphasis on comprehensive consideration.\n- The phrase \"have been reflected in\" is accurate and maintains the passive voice used in the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset mix of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in word choice, phrasing, and emphasis. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"full backing\" and \"in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements,\" which are appropriate. However, \"in order to preserve\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"ample support\" instead of \"full backing,\" which is a slight variation in meaning but still acceptable. The phrase \"to safeguard asset value\" is concise and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with \"full support\" and \"in accordance with the Currency Board system.\" The phrase \"in order to safeguard\" is slightly more formal than needed, but still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate and natural. It uses \"monetary base\" (lowercase) instead of \"Monetary Base\" (title case), which is a minor inconsistency. The phrase \"to ensure the value\" is slightly less formal than \"to safeguard the value.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but has a minor issue: it mentions only \"bond markets\" and omits \"stock markets\" in the Investment Portfolio section. This is a factual error. Additionally, \"aiming to ensure the preservation of asset value\" is slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"to provide full support\" and \"to ensure the value,\" which are natural and concise. It also correctly includes both \"bond markets\" and \"stock markets.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"Currency Board system\" is more commonly used than \"Currency Board arrangements\" in financial contexts, so it is preferable.\n- \"Monetary Base\" should be capitalized as it refers to a specific economic concept.\n- \"Investment Portfolio\" is more standard than \"IP\" in formal writing.\n- \"Bond markets and stock markets\" should both be included for accuracy.\n- \"Safeguard\" is more precise than \"preserve\" or \"ensure\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"in accordance with the Currency Board system\" is more natural than \"in accordance with the regulations of the Currency Board system.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund is largely divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full support for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, in order to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and gradually diversified a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a broader range of asset classes, including debt securities and equity securities from emerging markets and the Mainland, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Debt securities and equity securities from emerging markets and the Mainland are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus plus the total amount of deposits from the Future Fund and subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and clarity. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, the phrase \"for strategic purposes under the government's account\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is clear and grammatically sound. The structure is natural, and the meaning is well-preserved. It is one of the stronger translations.\n3. **Third junior translator**: The phrase \"purchased for the Exchange Fund accounts for strategic purposes by the government\" is confusing and grammatically incorrect. The sentence structure is awkward and may mislead the reader.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. The phrase \"purchased for the Exchange Fund account by the Government for strategic purposes\" is clear and well-structured. The use of \"Government\" with a capital \"G\" is appropriate in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and natural. The phrase \"that the government purchased for the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes\" is clear and well-structured. The sentence flows smoothly and is easy to understand.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: The phrase \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account\" is grammatically incorrect. \"Exchange Fund account\" should not be used as a subject in this way. The sentence structure is slightly off, which affects the clarity.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and preserve the original meaning without unnecessary complexity. It should also use the exact terms from the dictionary: \"Strategic Portfolio,\" \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" The phrase \"for strategic purposes\" should be clearly attributed to the government, and the sentence structure should reflect that the government purchased the shares for the Exchange Fund.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the clarity of the fifth and fourth translations, ensuring grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that the government purchased for the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the Exchange Fund's investment performance assessment does not include it.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"the\" before \"Future Fund\" in the first sentence, which is slightly inconsistent with the more formal tone of the original text.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent but has a minor grammatical issue with \"except primarily for the Future Fund,\" which is awkwardly phrased. It uses \"investment portfolio\" in lowercase, which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's preference for \"Investment Portfolio\" as a proper noun.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"IP\" from the dictionary, which is acceptable but less formal than \"Investment Portfolio.\" It also uses \"allocation\" instead of \"proportion,\" which is a slight deviation from the original meaning. The use of \"Government funds\" with a capital \"G\" is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase version.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is well-structured and grammatically correct. It uses \"from time to time\" instead of \"occasionally,\" which is a stylistic choice but still accurate. It correctly uses \"the Future Fund\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" as per the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"from time to time\" and \"allocation\" appropriately. However, it capitalizes \"Government funds\" inconsistently with the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is grammatically sound but uses \"investment portfolios\" in lowercase, which may not align with the dictionary's preference for \"Investment Portfolio\" as a proper noun. It also uses \"investment portfolio\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" correctly.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Consistency in terminology is crucial. The dictionary specifies \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" as proper nouns, so they should be capitalized.\n- \"From time to time\" is a more formal and natural alternative to \"occasionally\" in this context.\n- \"Proportion\" is more precise than \"allocation\" in the context of financial assets.\n- \"Government funds\" should be in lowercase as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"with the Future Fund being the main exception\" is more natural than \"except primarily for the Future Fund.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund from time to time accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio, with the Future Fund being the main exception. The interest rate for Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio mix. As of the end of 2018, the proportion of the Future Fund in the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and clarity. A critical review of each translation reveals the following:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"tactical deviations,\" \"tracking error,\" and \"HKMA.\" However, some translations use \"strategic allocation\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" interchangeably, which may confuse readers. The term \"strategic asset allocation\" should be used consistently for \"策略性資產配置,\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" for \"戰略性資產配置.\"\n2. **Clarity and Precision**: The first and fifth translations are the most precise in explaining the relationship between strategic and tactical allocations. The fifth translation also uses \"benchmark configuration\" instead of \"benchmark allocation,\" which is slightly less precise than \"benchmark allocation\" as per the dictionary.\n3. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"strategically allocates assets to seek returns exceeding the benchmark\" (fourth translation), which is less natural than \"strategic allocation as a guide to conduct tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns exceeding the benchmark.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use formal and professional language suitable for financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement**: The best translation should maintain precise terminology, ensure clarity in the distinction between strategic and tactical allocations, and use natural, fluent English. It should also avoid redundancy and ensure that the relationship between the investment process, benchmark, and deviations is clearly conveyed.\n---\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the allocation reflected in the investment benchmark, indicating the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to conduct tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The HKMA is authorized to determine tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can select positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\nThe original text is a single term, \"直接投資,\" which is defined in the dictionary as \"Direct investment.\" All junior translators have provided translations that are either \"Direct Investment\" or \"# Direct investment\" with slight variations in capitalization and punctuation.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Direct investment\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The translations are concise and accurate in terms of terminology.\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of the hashtag (#) in translations 2, 3, and 6 is unnecessary and does not align with standard English usage for this term.\n- Inconsistencies in capitalization (\"Direct Investment\" vs. \"Direct investment\") may be misleading, though both are technically correct.\nImprovements:\n- Remove the hashtag to maintain clarity and standard formatting.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization, using \"Direct investment\" as the most neutral and commonly used form in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation is \"Direct investment,\" without any additional punctuation or unnecessary capitalization.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"IP\" and \"BP\" as abbreviations, which are acceptable given the dictionary. However, \"IP\" is used inconsistently (e.g., \"Exchange Fund’s IP\" vs. \"this portion of the IP\"). The phrase \"executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"BP\" and \"IP\" correctly. The phrase \"part of the IP\" is more consistent than the first translation. However, \"implements\" is slightly less precise than \"execute\" or \"employ\" in the context of risk management strategies.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"Backing Portfolio\" and \"Investment Portfolio\" in full, which is more readable than abbreviations. However, \"macro risk management strategies for the Exchange Fund are implemented through derivatives\" is slightly wordy and less direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"EFIO\" as an abbreviation for the office, which is appropriate. It also uses \"Backing Portfolio\" and \"Investment Portfolio\" in full, which improves readability. The phrase \"employs derivatives to implement\" is clear and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"exclusively handle\" which is slightly more restrictive than the original text. Also, \"These Investment Portfolios are invested in...\" is awkward and incorrect, as it refers to multiple portfolios when the text refers to one.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Very similar to the third and fourth translations. It uses \"implements\" and is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The use of abbreviations like \"EFIO,\" \"IP,\" and \"BP\" should be consistent and only used when they are standard in the field.\n- The phrase \"executes\" or \"implements\" should be used with care, as \"execute\" is more commonly used in financial contexts for strategies.\n- The term \"derivatives\" should be used as per the dictionary, and the sentence structure should be clear and concise.\n- The phrase \"the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio\" is more precise than \"the entire BP and part of the IP.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA established the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August, responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office's staff directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the Investment Portfolio is invested in global fixed-income markets and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivatives.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of employing external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, aiming to achieve sustainable returns, enabling the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and professional investment expertise.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"外聘投資經理\" as \"external fund managers,\" \"基金管理與託管費\" as \"fund management and custodian fees,\" \"交易費\" as \"transaction costs,\" and \"預扣稅及其他稅項\" as \"withholding and other taxes.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"primarily influenced by market factors\" and \"vary annually\" or \"vary from year to year\" is appropriate and conveys the intended nuance.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator uses \"are mainly influenced by market factors\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than \"are primarily influenced by market factors.\"\n- The second and third translators use \"primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually\" or \"vary each year,\" which are both acceptable but slightly less natural than \"vary from year to year.\"\n- The fourth junior translator uses \"hiring\" instead of \"employing,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation.\n- The fifth junior translator uses \"primarily due to market factors\" which is slightly more wordy than \"primarily influenced by market factors.\"\n- The sixth junior translator uses \"affected by\" instead of \"influenced by,\" which is a minor stylistic choice but slightly less precise in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- To enhance fluency and naturalness, \"vary from year to year\" is slightly more idiomatic than \"vary annually\" or \"vary each year.\"\n- \"Primarily influenced by market factors\" is more concise and formal than \"primarily due to market factors.\"\n- \"Expenses related to employing external fund managers\" is slightly more formal than \"expenses related to hiring external fund managers,\" though both are acceptable.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nExpenses related to employing external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"risk assessment,\" \"risk-control tools,\" and \"performance attribution analyses.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology and maintain a formal tone suitable for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have minor grammatical issues, such as missing articles (e.g., \"HKMA has established strict control measures...\") or awkward phrasing (e.g., \"to keep pace with the Exchange Fund’s increasingly diversified investments\").\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term \"investment portfolio\" is translated as \"IP\" in one translation, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preferred options of \"IP\" or \"Investment Portfolio.\" However, \"IP\" is an abbreviation and may not be suitable in all contexts.\n- **Clarity and Nuance:** Some translations use phrases like \"drivers of different performance\" or \"factors contributing to different performance outcomes,\" which are acceptable but could be more precise. The original text emphasizes identifying the causes behind performance differences, which is best captured by \"identify the causes behind different performance outcomes.\"\n- **Punctuation and Sentence Flow:** A few translations lack proper punctuation or have run-on sentences, which can affect readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should maintain a formal, professional tone while ensuring clarity and grammatical correctness.\n- It should use the dictionary terms consistently and appropriately, avoiding abbreviations unless they are standard in the field.\n- The sentence structure should be varied to avoid monotony and enhance readability.\n- The translation should accurately reflect the original's emphasis on the importance of risk management, the implementation of control measures, and the analytical processes used by the HKMA.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe increasingly complex investment environment highlights the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has enhanced its risk assessment to align with the growing diversification of the Exchange Fund's investments; it also employs risk-control tools to assess market risk under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to identify the causes behind different performance outcomes, thereby assessing how to fully leverage the investment management capabilities of both internal and external fund managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"equity securities,\" and \"FCLTGlobal.\"\n- The structure and content of the translations are largely consistent with the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate terminology for ESG factors and responsible investment.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Capitalization of \"Responsible investment\":** Some translations capitalize \"Responsible investment\" inconsistently. The dictionary lists it as \"Responsible investment\" without capitalization, so it should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun, which it is not.\n- **Use of \"PRO\":** The term \"PRO\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary provides both \"PRO\" and \"Principles of Responsible Ownership.\" While \"PRO\" is acceptable, it is less clear and should be used only if the context explicitly refers to the acronym.\n- **Variations in phrasing:** Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"supervision\" instead of \"monitoring\" or \"long-term goals-oriented\" instead of \"based on long-term goals.\" These variations are minor but affect fluency and consistency.\n- **Redundancy and repetition:** Some translations repeat \"environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Maintain consistent capitalization of \"responsible investment\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use the full term \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" unless the acronym \"PRO\" is explicitly referenced.\n- Ensure consistent use of terms like \"monitoring\" and \"long-term goals.\"\n- Streamline the text to avoid redundancy and improve fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to assist investors in determining how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, applicable to the selection, appointment and monitoring processes of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity securities portfolios must comply with the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" when managing these investments. Overall, the HKMA has incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of relevant ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the not-for-profit organisation FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term goals.\n\n# The original text is simply the heading \"# 外匯基金的表現\", which translates directly to \"The Exchange Fund’s performance\" according to the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly translated the term \"外匯基金的表現\" as \"The Exchange Fund’s performance,\" which is accurate and matches the dictionary entry.\nHowever, there is a notable inconsistency in the formatting of the translations. Specifically, translations 2 and 5 include the \"#\" symbol at the beginning, which is present in the original Chinese text. This symbol is typically used in markdown to denote headings, so its inclusion in the English translation is appropriate if the goal is to maintain the original formatting. On the other hand, translations 1, 3, 4, and 6 omit the \"#\" symbol, which may be a mistake if the formatting is intended to be preserved.\nIn terms of fluency, grammar, and vocabulary, all translations are correct and natural. The phrase \"The Exchange Fund’s performance\" is a standard and appropriate way to translate \"外匯基金的表現\" in an English context, especially in financial or economic discussions.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain the original formatting, including the \"#\" symbol, as it likely serves a structural or stylistic purpose in the document. Therefore, the most accurate and well-formatted translation would be to include the \"#\" symbol, as seen in translations 2 and 5.\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\n# The financial markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, multiple risk factors that had previously been underestimated by the market emerged one by one, including the pace of interest rate normalisation, the impact of the US government’s foreign trade policy and protectionism on global trade, as well as the geopolitical environment, leading to significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"US-China trade disputes,\" \"emerging market,\" \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"MSCI World Index,\" and \"MSCI Emerging Markets Index.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, clarity, and precision that can be refined for maximum fluency and accuracy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the escalation of trade disputes, the decline in stock markets, and the specific percentage drops in the indices.\n- The use of terms from the dictionary is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"since the end of January\" while others use \"since early January.\" The original text says \"自1月底開始,\" which more accurately translates to \"since the end of January.\"\n- The phrase \"fluctuating downward\" or \"fluctuating declines\" is used in several translations, which is slightly redundant. A more natural phrasing would be \"repeatedly falling\" or \"continuously declining.\"\n- Some translations use \"two-digit percentage drops\" or \"double-digit losses,\" which are both acceptable, but \"double-digit losses\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"which covers developed market stocks\" is used in some translations, while others use \"which covers developed country stock markets.\" The former is more concise and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"since the end of January\" to match the original text.\n- Replace \"fluctuating downward\" with \"repeatedly falling\" or \"continuously declining\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Use \"double-digit losses\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"which covers developed market stocks\" for brevity and natural phrasing.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate these refinements while maintaining the clarity and accuracy of the original message.\nThe US-China trade disputes have escalated, causing significant concern among investors. Emerging markets and the Hong Kong stock market have repeatedly fallen since the end of January, with the Hang Seng Index declining as much as 27% from its peak that month. Starting in the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets also sharply declined, recording double-digit losses. Overall in 2018, global stock markets generally fell, with the MSCI World Index, which covers developed market stocks, declining 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also falling 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond markets, US Treasury yields generally rose in 2018 due to US monetary policy normalisation. However, the bond markets remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the 10-year US Treasury yields increased from around 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by the end of the year, influenced by investors' concerns over the US-China trade disputes and a shift towards safe haven assets.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened this year following US interest rate hikes. The US dollar index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the Chinese yuan fell approximately 5% against the dollar. Additionally, some emerging markets were further impacted by domestic political and economic instability, leading to further depreciation of their currencies. For example, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira fell by approximately 50% and 30% against the dollar, respectively. In contrast, demand for safe haven assets drove the Japanese yen up 2.7% against the dollar.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Returns\n\n# The original text is simply the heading \"# 外匯基金的表現\", which translates directly to \"The Exchange Fund’s performance\" according to the provided dictionary.

Therefore, the most accurate and well-formatted translation would be to include the \"#\" symbol, as seen in translations 2 and 5.\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage and structure. It correctly uses \"currency translation effect\" and \"valuation loss\" as per the dictionary. However, it incorrectly states \"HK$10.9 billion\" instead of \"HK$109 billion\" for the total investment income, which is a critical numerical error.\n- **Translation 2** correctly uses all dictionary terms and provides the correct figures (HK$109 billion, HK$574 billion, etc.). However, it uses \"HKD\" instead of \"HK$\" and writes \"non-HKD assets\" instead of \"non-Hong Kong dollar assets\" as specified in the dictionary. This is a minor but important deviation.\n- **Translation 3** misrepresents the figures (e.g., HK$10.9 billion instead of HK$109 billion, HK$57.4 billion instead of HK$574 billion), which is a major issue. It also incorrectly uses \"non-HKD assets\" instead of \"non-Hong Kong dollar assets.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses the correct figures and dictionary terms, but mislabels \"currency translation effect\" as the cause of the \"valuation loss\" on non-HKD assets, which is not the clearest phrasing. It also uses \"HKD\" instead of \"HK$.\"\n- **Translation 5** misrepresents the figures (e.g., HK$20.7 billion instead of HK$207 billion), which is a significant error. It also uses \"HKD\" and \"HKD 500 million\" instead of \"HK$500 million.\"\n- **Translation 6** correctly uses \"currency translation effect\" and \"valuation loss\" but incorrectly states \"investment income of HKD 2.19 billion from other investments\" instead of \"other investment income from investment holding subsidiaries.\" It also uses \"HKD\" instead of \"HK$.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct figures as stated in the original text.\n- Use the exact dictionary terms as specified.\n- Use \"HK$\" instead of \"HKD\" for consistency with financial reporting standards.\n- Maintain clarity and fluency in English.\nBased on this, the best translation would be a synthesis of Translation 2 and Translation 1, correcting the numerical errors and ensuring proper formatting and terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$109 billion in 2018, which included gains on bonds of HK$574 billion, losses on Hong Kong equities of HK$207 billion, losses on other equities of HK$387 billion, a currency translation effect of HK$90 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and other investment income of HK$219 billion from investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$5 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund's total assets reached HKD 405.49 billion. The total market value of investments in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HKD 283.6 billion, of which private equity amounted to HKD 191.1 billion and real estate amounted to HKD 92.5 billion. Investment commitments, which had been incurred but not yet drawn down, totaled HKD 202.4 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information accurately, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金\" and \"Strategic Portfolio\" for \"策略性資產組合.\"\n- Most translations use \"Investment Portfolio\" for \"投資組合\" and \"Backing Portfolio\" for \"支持組合,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"annualised internal rate of return\" is used correctly for \"內部回報率年率\" in most translations.\n- The phrase \"since inception\" is appropriately used for \"開展投資以來\" in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"annual rate of return\" instead of \"rate of return\" for the 0.3% figure, which is less precise than \"rate of return\" as per the dictionary.\n- The second translation uses \"had a rate of return of 0.3%\" and \"had an annualised internal rate of return,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less fluent than alternatives.\n- The third translation uses \"achieved a rate of return\" and \"delivering a rate of return,\" which is more verbose and less direct.\n- The fourth translation uses \"investment return\" and \"returning,\" which is acceptable but not as standard as \"rate of return.\"\n- The fifth translation uses \"IP\" for \"投資組合\" and \"the IP’s rate of return,\" which is acceptable but less clear than \"Investment Portfolio.\"\n- The sixth translation is the most fluent and precise, using \"recorded an investment return\" and \"achieved an annualised internal rate of return.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"rate of return\" consistently for \"回報率.\"\n- Use \"Investment Portfolio\" and \"Backing Portfolio\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"annualised internal rate of return\" for \"內部回報率年率.\"\n- Use \"since inception\" for \"開展投資以來.\"\n- Maintain grammatical correctness and fluency.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the clarity of the sixth translation with the precision of the dictionary terms and the fluency of the first and second translations.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) recorded a rate of return of 0.3% in 2018, with the Investment Portfolio returning -2.4% and the Backing Portfolio returning 2.1%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 12.9% since inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the investment rate of return of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and the average investment rate of return for different periods. The average rate of return of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 3.2%, over the past 5 years was 2.1%, over the past 10 years was 2.8%, and since 1994 has been 4.7%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2018.\n"}

公眾教育計劃\n\n金管局資訊中心設於國際金融中心2期55樓，向公眾介紹金管局工作及提高公眾對貨幣與銀行業事宜的了解。資訊中心分為展覽館及圖書館兩部分，每星期6天開放予公眾參觀使用。展覽館介紹金管局的工作，以及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展；另備閱讀資料與展品，供研究香港貨幣、銀行業與金融事務。\n\n資訊中心的貨幣展區介紹香港紙幣與硬幣的設計、防偽特徵、製作過程及其他趣味知識。該展區在2018年第1季展開翻新工程，加入多項互動元素，例如寓學習於玩樂的遊戲，使訪客對香港貨幣有所認識之餘，更可樂在其中。此外，貨幣展區新增一棵藝術紫荊樹，是由2,018顆以不再適合流通並已切碎鈔票為媒材製成的透明立方塊拼綴而成，與展區內另一幅以香港硬幣為媒材砌成的馬賽克作品相映成趣。全新形象的貨幣展區於8月16日重新開放。\n\n資訊中心為訪客提供導賞服務。年內資訊中心接待超過59,000名訪客，並為學校及其他團體提供580多次導賞服務（圖3）。資訊中心自2003年12月啟用以來累計接待的訪客總數超過705,000人次。毗鄰展覽館的圖書館收藏26,000多種書籍、期刊及其他刊物，以供研究香港貨幣、銀行業、金融與中央銀行事務等課題。圖書館亦備存《銀行業條例》第20條規定的「認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊」及「認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊」。\n\n推出互動遊戲介紹香港鈔票製作過程。\n\n藝術紫荊樹懸於半空，配以燈光效果，展現樹姿在不同季節的美態。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體提供導賞服務。\n\n來自各區的中學生及教師出席公眾教育講座。\n\n為與社區保持聯繫及增進市民對金管局工作的認識，金管局在2018年共舉辦3場公眾教育講座，吸引約1,500名中學生及教師參加，主題包括聯匯制度、香港鈔票、銀行體系穩定、存款保障計劃、「轉數快」、儲值支付工具、金融科技、消費者保障及金融業就業資訊等。教育講座自1998年推出以來，已有接近6萬名師生參與。\n\n圖3 2018年到訪資訊中心的團體類別\n\n# 金管局員工\n\n金管局是政府架構的一部分，但按非公務員條款聘請員工，吸引具適當經驗及專門知識的人才。作為公營機構，金管局不斷精簡工作流程，提高效率及成本效益。金管局致力維持精簡靈活的組織架構，並盡可能透過調配現有人手推行新措施及應付不斷增加的工作量。\n\n金管局是提供平等就業機會的僱主，並確保員工能夠在沒有歧視的環境下工作。金管局的平等機會政策適用於聘用、薪酬與福利、表現評核、晉升、調職╱培訓機會及一般行為操守等方面。\n\n金管局聘用、培訓及維持一支專業優秀的工作團隊，以履行政策目標及靈活應對工作要求的轉變。金管局要求其員工維持高水平的操守及道德標準，不論何時都恪守極高的個人行為及操守規範，並以金管局的最佳利益為依歸。\n\n# 2019年1月1日的主要人力資源數據\n\n# 2018年組織架構變動\n\n外匯基金投資辦公室於8月1日成立，取代過往由儲備管理部與風險管理及監察部負責的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的成立凸顯金管局的投資職能，提升其機構形象，並能更靈活應對市場的變化，以配合持續擴展及多元化的外匯基金投資工作。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表1 2019年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n負責監察投資風險的員工為外匯基金投資辦公室組織架構的一部分， 在此則歸納於風險管理及監察部以方便呈示其工作職能。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2018年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。\n2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。金管局高層人員人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁、處置機制辦公室專員及外匯基金投資辦公室首席營運官在內。\n3. 其他福利包括公積金或合約酬金（視情況而定）、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國庫券收益率":["10-year US Treasury yields"],"2014\/2015年為基期的數列":["2014\/2015-based series"],"2018年的金融市場":["The financial

only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\", \"official website\" for \"網站\", \"corporate governance\" for \"機構管治\", \"cybersecurity\" or \"IT security\" for \"資訊科技保安\", and \"public education programmes\" for \"公眾教育活動\". This adherence to the dictionary is commendable.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, there are slight variations in style and word choice that could be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English. For instance, \"society and the market\" is used in some translations, while others use \"the community and the market\" or \"society and the market.\" While all are acceptable, \"society and the market\" is more consistent with the original Chinese and is used in most translations.\nThe phrase \"to address the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and increasingly demanding workloads\" appears in several translations. While accurate, \"increasingly demanding workloads\" is slightly more formal than \"increasingly heavy workload\" or \"increasing workload,\" which may be more natural in this context.\nThe use of \"supporting employees in enhancing professional capabilities\" versus \"supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities\" is also a minor stylistic choice. Both are correct, but \"staff\" may be more commonly used in formal institutional contexts.\nThe phrase \"exercising strict financial control\" is used in one translation, which is slightly more formal than \"strictly controlling finances,\" but both are acceptable.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while ensuring natural phrasing and consistency in terminology. It would use \"society and the market,\" \"increasing workload,\" and \"supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities\" for a balanced and natural tone.\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with society and the market through the media, official website, public education programmes, and other channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen corporate governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, and strengthening cybersecurity, to address the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and the increasing workload.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n# 傳媒關係與社交媒體\nThe original text is a simple title consisting of two terms: \"傳媒關係\" (media relations) and \"社交媒體\" (social media). The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely accurate and consistent with standard English usage. However, there are a few observations to be made:\n1. **Capitalization and Punctuation**: The first and fourth translations include the hashtag symbol (#) at the beginning, which is not present in the original Chinese text. This may be an unnecessary addition unless the context specifically requires it (e.g., for social media posts or hashtags). The original text appears to be a standard title, so the hashtag should be omitted.\n2. **Capitalization**: The first, fifth, and sixth translations use title case (\"Media Relations and Social Media\"), while the second, third, and fourth use sentence case (\"media relations and social media\"). Title case is more appropriate for headings or titles, especially in formal or professional contexts, which seems to be the case here.\n3. **Consistency**: All translations are consistent in terms of terminology, using \"media relations\" and \"social media\" correctly. These are standard translations for the respective Chinese terms and are widely accepted in both academic and professional contexts.\n4. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically correct and fluent in English. There are no errors in syntax or vocabulary.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The terms \"media relations\" and \"social media\" are culturally appropriate in English and accurately reflect the meaning of the original Chinese terms.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nGiven the above observations, the best translation would be in title case without the hashtag, as it aligns with standard title formatting and avoids unnecessary punctuation. The most appropriate translation is therefore:\n**Media Relations and Social Media**\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and structure that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is clear and accurate, using \"enhance its transparency\" and \"improve public understanding.\" It also uses \"held a total of 96 public media events\" and \"handled a large number of media inquiries daily.\" The structure is natural and fluent.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"promote public understanding\" instead of \"improve,\" which is slightly less common in formal contexts. It also uses \"organized\" instead of \"held,\" which is acceptable but slightly less direct. The structure is still fluent.\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"arranged\" for \"media interviews\" and \"issued\" for \"press releases,\" which are both correct. The structure is natural.\n4. **Translation 4** is nearly identical to Translation 3, with the addition of \"during the year\" for \"media interviews.\" This is slightly more explicit but not incorrect.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"operations\" instead of \"work\" and \"public activities\" instead of \"public events.\" While these are not incorrect, \"public events\" is more precise in this context. It also uses \"on a daily basis\" instead of \"daily,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"maintains close communication\" instead of \"maintains close contact,\" which is a slight variation in phrasing. It also uses \"throughout the year\" and \"a large volume of media inquiries,\" which are both natural and accurate.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"improve public understanding\" as it is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- Use \"held\" instead of \"organized\" or \"arranged\" for consistency with the original verb \"舉辦.\"\n- Use \"public events\" instead of \"public activities\" for precision.\n- Use \"daily\" instead of \"on a daily basis\" for conciseness.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated exactly as specified: \"HKMA,\" \"press conferences,\" and \"stand-up interviews.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary terms and natural English phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the HKMA held a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews, and 64 other public events. In addition, 39 media interviews were arranged, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued, with a large number of media inquiries handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA's core activities, the HKMA organizes press briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, covering a variety of topics including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further leverage social media to strengthen communication with the public.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan (left) and the Environment Bureau’s mascot, Big Waster, have joined forces through social media to promote the use of good-as-new banknotes for wrapping lai-sees.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's core activities and operations. In 2018, it handled 9,950 inquiries, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, and banknotes and coins, particularly the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, guidelines and circulars related to the banking sector, the Faster Payment System (FPS), virtual banking, and the 2018 New Series Hong Kong Banknotes.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of each type of inquiry in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text, \"圖1 公眾查詢總數.\" However, there are minor differences in style and punctuation that can be refined for consistency and fluency.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"Queries,\" while the second, third, and sixth use \"Inquiries.\" Both \"queries\" and \"inquiries\" are acceptable translations for \"查詢,\" but \"inquiries\" is more commonly used in formal or official contexts, which seems appropriate here given the likely nature of the data being presented (e.g., public inquiries to a government or organization).\nThe second and third translations differ in punctuation: the second uses a colon after \"Figure 1,\" while the third omits the colon. The standard format for labeling figures in English is \"Figure 1: [Title],\" so including the colon is more consistent with standard formatting.\nThe fifth translation, \"Figure 1: Total public inquiries,\" omits \"Number of,\" which makes the phrase slightly less formal and precise. Including \"Number of\" adds clarity and formality, which is appropriate for a title that likely appears in a report or document.\nBased on these observations, the most refined and consistent translation would be \"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries,\" as it uses the more formal term \"inquiries,\" includes the colon for standard formatting, and maintains the full phrase \"Number of\" for clarity and precision.\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2018, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin in 2018, and regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 13 inSight articles, explaining various thematic issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"HKMA\" as the official name for 金管局.\n- The term \"Coin Carts\" is consistently used for 收銀車, and the dictionary terms for other key phrases are mostly respected.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the translations are fluent and grammatically sound.\n- The use of \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" for 轉數快 is consistent across most translations, with only one using \"FPS\" alone.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first junior translator incorrectly translates 認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊 as \"register of securities staff\" without including \"authorized institutions,\" which is a key part of the term.\n- The second and third junior translators use \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" for 認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊, which is more accurate than the first translation.\n- The term \"SVF licensees\" is used in the dictionary, but some translations use \"Stored Value Facility Licensees\" instead of \"SVF licensees,\" which is less concise.\n- The phrase \"facilitating public access\" is used in some translations, while others use \"making it convenient for the public to access,\" which is more natural.\n- The term \"institutional website\" in the fifth translation is not in the dictionary, and \"official website\" is the correct term.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"official website\" as per the dictionary.\n- The full term \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" should be used for 認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊.\n- \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions\" should be used for 認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊.\n- \"Register of Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees\" is the most complete and accurate term from the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"making it convenient for the public to access\" is more natural than \"facilitating public access.\"\n- The term \"FPS\" should be used with the full name \"Faster Payment System\" for clarity.\n- The phrase \"being cautious of phone scams\" is more natural than \"guarding against telephone scams\" or \"being vigilant against telephone fraud.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA's official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English and Traditional and Simplified Chinese, making it convenient for the public to access the latest information from the HKMA. The website also hosts the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees\" under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated topic pages and prominent quick links to highlight new HKMA initiatives, such as the Faster Payment System (FPS), and important and timely matters, such as being cautious of phone scams and the parking locations of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\nTo promote the implementation of Open APIs in the banking sector, the HKMA is leading by example by providing Open APIs on its official website starting in July, facilitating public access to important HKMA information. The first 50 sets of Open APIs were successfully launched in July, covering areas frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and the Coin Cart Schedule. The remaining 80 sets of data will be rolled out in phases by mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on the website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the design and content of its official website to make it more user-friendly and accessible. The redesigned website is expected to be launched within 2019.\n\nHKMA leads by example in promoting the development and application of Open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but contains a critical error: \"liberalisation six days a week\" is incorrect. \"開放\" should be translated as \"open\" or \"open to the public,\" not \"liberalisation,\" which refers to economic policy. The sentence structure is awkward in this instance.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the correct meaning. However, it also incorrectly uses \"liberalisation\" instead of \"open.\" The sentence \"is liberalisation to the public for visits six days a week\" is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It correctly uses \"open\" for \"開放\" and avoids the error seen in the first two translations. However, it uses \"functions\" for \"工作\" in the context of the HKMA, which is slightly less precise than \"work\" or \"operations.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"open\" for \"開放\" and provides a natural sentence structure. It also uses \"sections\" for \"部分,\" which is acceptable, though \"parts\" is more common in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"open\" correctly and maintains a natural flow. It also uses \"comprises\" for \"分為,\" which is a more formal and precise term than \"divided into.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"researching\" instead of \"research on,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"open\" and avoids the error seen in the first two translations. It also uses \"divided into\" for \"分為,\" which is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"enhance public understanding of monetary and banking sector matters\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"enhance public understanding of monetary and banking matters.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"open\" for \"開放\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"HKMA Information Centre\" for \"金管局資訊中心.\"\n- Use \"banking sector\" for \"銀行業.\"\n- Maintain a natural and fluent English structure.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing and ensure clarity.\nBased on this, the fifth and sixth translations are the strongest, with the sixth being slightly more concise and natural in phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, and aims to introduce the HKMA’s work and enhance public understanding of monetary and banking sector matters. The Information Centre is divided into an exhibition hall and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA’s work, as well as the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking sector; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking sector, and financial affairs.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"security features,\" \"currency section,\" \"Information Centre,\" \"Bauhinia tree,\" \"production process,\" \"mosaic artwork,\" \"see-through cubes,\" \"banknotes,\" \"revamp,\" and \"liberalisation\" (though \"liberalisation\" is not the best fit for \"開放\").\n- Most translations maintain the structure and flow of the original text, with clear explanations of the revamp and the new features.\n- The use of terms like \"interactive elements,\" \"educational games,\" and \"complement\" are appropriate and convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Liberalisation\"** is incorrectly used for \"開放\" (open). The correct term from the dictionary is \"revamp,\" and \"open\" should be used instead of \"liberalisation.\"\n- Some translations use \"exhibition area\" instead of \"currency section,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"game-based learning\" in one translation is less natural than \"games that combine learning with fun.\"\n- Some translations use \"launched a revamp\" instead of \"underwent a revamp,\" which is less idiomatic.\n- The phrase \"with its new look\" in one translation is less precise than \"with its revamped image\" or \"with its revamp.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"open\" is used for \"開放\" and not \"liberalisation.\"\n- Use \"currency section\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Choose more natural phrasing such as \"games that combine learning with fun\" over \"game-based learning.\"\n- Use \"underwent a revamp\" instead of \"launched a revamp.\"\n- Ensure that the final sentence uses \"revamped\" consistently with the dictionary term.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Information Centre’s currency section introduces the design, security features, production process, and other interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. The section underwent a revamp in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating various interactive elements, such as games that combine learning with fun, allowing visitors to learn about Hong Kong currency while enjoying themselves. In addition, the currency section has added a Bauhinia tree, constructed from 2,018 see-through cubes made from shredded banknotes no longer suitable for circulation, which complements another mosaic artwork within the section made from Hong Kong coins. The revamped currency section reopened on August 16.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"Information Centre\" for \"資訊中心.\"\n- The term \"guided tours\" is consistently used for \"導賞服務,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"Banking Ordinance\" is correctly used for \"《銀行業條例》.\"\n- The term \"register of securities staff\" is used correctly in most translations, though some use \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" which is not in the dictionary.\n- The term \"authorized institutions\" is used correctly for \"認可機構.\"\n- The term \"local representative offices\" is used correctly for \"本地代表辦事處.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Translation 2 and 4 use \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" which is not in the dictionary. The correct term is \"register of securities staff.\"\n- Translation 5 incorrectly separates \"register of securities staff\" and \"register of local representative offices,\" omitting \"authorized institutions\" from the former, which is required by the dictionary.\n- Translation 6 incorrectly states \"exceeded 705,000 times\" instead of \"exceeded 705,000 visitors.\"\n- Translation 6 also uses \"banking sector, finance, and central banking matters,\" which is slightly awkward compared to the more concise \"banking sector, finance, and central banking.\"\n- Translation 5 and 6 use \"banking sector\" and \"central banking\" interchangeably, which is acceptable but could be more consistent.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"register of securities staff\" is used without adding \"of authorized institutions\" unless it is explicitly in the dictionary.\n- Use \"central banking\" consistently instead of \"central bank affairs\" or \"central banking matters.\"\n- Ensure that the number of visitors is clearly stated as \"over 705,000 visitors\" and not \"over 705,000 times.\"\n- Use \"maintains\" consistently for \"備存\" instead of \"holds\" or \"houses.\"\n- Ensure that the full title \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" is used as per the dictionary.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre received over 59,000 visitors and provided guided tours for schools and other groups 580 times (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has cumulatively received over 705,000 visitors. The library, located adjacent to the exhibition hall, holds over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics such as Hong Kong currency, the banking sector, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"register of securities staff\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIntroduce the production process of Hong Kong banknotes through an interactive game.\n\nThe original sentence describes an artistic display of a Bauhinia tree suspended in mid-air with lighting effects, emphasizing the tree's beauty across different seasons. The junior translators have all correctly used \"Bauhinia tree\" as required by the dictionary. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and nuance that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the accurate use of \"Bauhinia tree\" and the general structure of the sentence. The use of \"accompanied by,\" \"complemented by,\" and \"paired with\" all convey the idea of the lighting effects enhancing the tree. The phrase \"showcasing its beauty in different seasons\" is common and effective, though \"showcasing the beauty of the tree's form\" adds a slightly more detailed nuance.\nWeaknesses include redundancy and lack of variation in phrasing. For example, translations 2, 3, and 4 use \"showcasing its beauty in different seasons,\" which is repetitive. Translation 5 improves this by using \"across different seasons,\" which is slightly more natural. Translation 6 uses \"showcases the beauty of the tree’s form in different seasons,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward due to the placement of \"showcases.\"\nImprovements could include varying the verbs used to describe the lighting effects and the tree's display. \"Suspended\" is a more precise term than \"hangs\" when describing something mid-air. Also, \"form\" can be omitted if it doesn't add significant meaning, as the sentence is more about the beauty of the tree in different seasons rather than its physical form.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"suspended\" for a more precise description, vary the verb used for the lighting effects, and ensure the sentence flows naturally while maintaining the intended meaning.\nThe final translation is:\nThe Bauhinia tree is suspended in mid-air, paired with lighting effects, showcasing its beauty across different seasons.\n\nThe original sentence, \"資訊中心為學校及其他團體提供導賞服務。\" translates to \"The Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\" The dictionary specifies that \"資訊中心\" must be translated as \"Information Centre\" and \"導賞服務\" as \"guided tours.\" All six junior translations correctly use these terms.\nIn terms of grammar and fluency, all translations are grammatically correct and natural in English. The prepositions \"for\" and \"to\" are both acceptable in this context, though \"for\" is more commonly used when indicating the intended recipients of a service. The repetition of the same translation across multiple junior translators suggests a lack of variation in approach, but this does not detract from the accuracy or fluency of the translations.\nThe best possible translation would maintain the exact terminology from the dictionary while ensuring natural phrasing. Since all translations are essentially identical, there is no need for significant changes. However, to ensure the most natural and widely accepted phrasing, using \"for\" is preferable in this context.\nThe final translation is:\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers from various districts attended a public education seminar.\nThe original sentence is straightforward and concise. The junior translators have all correctly translated the key terms \"中學生\" as \"secondary school students\" and \"公眾教育講座\" as \"public education seminar.\" The only variation among the translations lies in the use of \"different districts\" versus \"various districts\" and the use of \"the\" versus \"a\" before \"public education seminar.\"\n\"Various districts\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in written English than \"different districts,\" making it a more appropriate choice for this context. Additionally, using \"a public education seminar\" rather than \"the public education seminar\" is more natural in this context, as it implies a general event rather than a specific one that has been previously mentioned.\nTherefore, the best translation is: \"Secondary school students and teachers from various districts attended a public education seminar.\"\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA's work, the HKMA held three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Faster Payment System (FPS), stored value facilities, fintech, consumer protection, and careers in the financial industry. Since the launch of the education seminars in 1998, nearly 60,000 teachers and students have participated.\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018\nThe original Chinese text is a straightforward title for a chart or diagram, likely from a report or presentation. The key term \"資訊中心\" is correctly translated as \"Information Centre\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary entry.\nThe first junior translator's version, \"Figure 3 Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018,\" is grammatically correct and fluent, though it lacks a colon after \"Figure 3,\" which is standard in such titles.\nThe second junior translator's version, \"Figure 3: Group Categories of Visitors to the Information Centre in 2018,\" is also correct but slightly changes the meaning by using \"Visitors\" instead of \"Groups,\" which may not be as precise as \"Groups\" in the original.\nThe third junior translator's version, \"Figure 3: Group categories visiting the Information Centre in 2018,\" is grammatically correct but uses lowercase \"categories,\" which is less formal and less appropriate for a title.\nThe fourth junior translator's version, \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018,\" is very similar to the first one but includes the colon, making it more standard for a title.\nThe fifth junior translator's version, \"Figure 3: Types of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018,\" uses \"Types\" instead of \"Categories,\" which is a synonym but slightly different in nuance. \"Categories\" is more commonly used in the context of grouping data.\nThe sixth junior translator's version, \"Figure 3: Types of Groups That Visited the Information Centre in 2018,\" is grammatically correct but includes \"That Visited,\" which is more verbose than necessary and slightly less concise than \"Visiting.\"\nConsidering all these translations, the best version would be the fourth one, \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018,\" as it is grammatically correct, uses the appropriate terminology, and follows standard title formatting with a colon after \"Figure 3.\" It also accurately reflects the original Chinese text without unnecessary changes or additions.\n\n# HKMA Staff\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"streamlines its work processes\" and \"reallocation of existing staff\" is appropriate. However, \"wherever possible\" is slightly less direct than \"as much as possible.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with slight variations in phrasing such as \"enhance efficiency\" and \"makes every effort.\" The use of \"streamlined and flexible\" is slightly more concise than \"lean and flexible.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has a minor grammatical error: \"As a public-sector entities\" should be \"As a public-sector entity.\" The use of \"workflows\" is slightly more technical than \"work processes,\" and \"redeployment\" is a less common term than \"reallocation.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"expertise\" instead of \"specialized knowledge\" is slightly more natural. The phrase \"cope with increasing workloads\" is more active than \"manage increasing workloads.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the fourth, with the use of \"utilizing existing staff\" instead of \"redeploying existing staff.\" While correct, \"utilizing\" is slightly less precise in this context than \"redeploying\" or \"reallocating.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation has a grammatical error: \"As public-sector entities\" should be \"As a public-sector entity.\" The use of \"streamlines workflows\" is slightly more technical than \"streamlines work processes.\" The phrase \"handles the increasing workload\" is slightly less active than \"cope with increasing workloads.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Lean and flexible\" is more commonly used in organizational contexts than \"streamlined and flexible.\"\n- \"Redeploying\" or \"reallocating\" is more precise than \"utilizing\" in the context of staff management.\n- \"Cope with\" is more active and natural than \"manage\" or \"handle\" in this context.\n- \"As much as possible\" is more direct and natural than \"wherever possible\" or \"makes every effort.\"\n- \"Work processes\" is more natural than \"workflows\" in this context.\n- \"Public-sector entity\" should be used consistently with the singular form, as \"HKMA\" is a singular entity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure, but it employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and expertise. As a public-sector entity, the HKMA continuously streamlines its work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The HKMA is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and strives to implement new measures and cope with increasing workloads by redeploying existing staff as much as possible.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and consistency with the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Consistency with Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms \"HKMA,\" \"equal opportunities employer,\" and \"equal opportunities policy.\" However, the term \"表現評核\" is consistently translated as \"performance assessment,\" which is accurate. The term \"薪酬\" is translated as \"remuneration\" in all translations, which is appropriate. The term \"一般行為操守\" is translated as \"general conduct,\" \"general code of conduct,\" or \"general conduct standards,\" with \"general conduct\" being the most concise and natural choice.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some variations in phrasing affect readability. For example, \"non-discriminatory environment\" and \"discrimination-free environment\" are both acceptable, but \"non-discriminatory\" is more commonly used in formal contexts. The use of \"recruitment\" instead of \"hiring\" or \"employment\" is appropriate, but the original text uses \"聘用,\" which is more accurately translated as \"employment\" or \"recruitment.\"\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The phrase \"remuneration and benefits\" is more precise than \"remuneration and welfare\" or \"remuneration and salary,\" as \"welfare\" is not explicitly mentioned in the original text. The term \"transfer\/training opportunities\" is acceptable, but \"job transfers\/training opportunities\" is slightly more explicit.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience, especially in formal or professional contexts. The use of \"general conduct\" is standard in workplace policies.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer and ensures that employees can work in a non-discriminatory environment. The HKMA’s equal opportunities policy applies to employment, remuneration and benefits, performance assessment, promotion, transfer\/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice, fluency, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" as the translation for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The core message of the original text is preserved in all translations: the HKMA's commitment to maintaining a professional team, upholding high ethical standards, and acting in its best interests.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the translations are grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Word Choice and Nuance:** Some translations use \"highly capable\" or \"excellent\" to describe the team, which is acceptable, but \"high-caliber\" or \"outstanding\" may be more precise in formal contexts.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat terms like \"standards of conduct and ethics\" or \"personal behavior and conduct,\" which can be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** While all translations are fluent, some phrases, such as \"adhering to the highest standards of personal conduct and ethics at all times,\" could be more naturally phrased as \"adhering to the highest standards of personal conduct and ethics at all times.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"high-caliber\" or \"outstanding\" to describe the workforce, as these terms are more formal and precise.\n- Avoid redundancy by using \"conduct and ethics\" once and not repeating it.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"acting in the best interests of the HKMA\" is used consistently and clearly.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while refining the language for clarity, precision, and natural flow.\nThe HKMA employs, trains, and maintains a professional and high-caliber workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to changing work requirements. The HKMA requires its employees to maintain high standards of integrity and ethics, adhering to the highest standards of personal conduct at all times, and acting in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# 2018 Organizational Structure Changes\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Investment Office,\" \"Risk & Compliance Department,\" \"Reserves Management Department,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" The translations also maintain the core message of the original text: the establishment of the Exchange Fund Investment Office, its purpose in replacing previous departments, and its benefits in terms of institutional image and flexibility.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and grammatically correct sentence structures.\n- Effective conveyance of the original meaning, including the purpose and benefits of the new office.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"accommodate\" or \"support\" in the final sentence, which are slightly less precise than \"align with\" or \"in line with\" when describing the relationship between the office's flexibility and the expansion of investment activities.\n- The use of \"taking over\" versus \"replacing\" is a minor stylistic choice, but \"replacing\" is more precise in this context.\n- The use of \"Risk and Compliance Department\" versus \"Risk & Compliance Department\" is a matter of style, but the former is more commonly used in formal English.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and accuracy of the junior translations while refining the final sentence for greater precision and fluency.\nFinal Translation:\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserves Management Department and the Risk & Compliance Department. The establishment of the Exchange Fund Investment Office highlights the HKMA's investment functions, enhances its institutional image, and enables it to respond more flexibly to market changes, in line with the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund's investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the HKMA by department.\n\nTable 1: HKMA Staff Establishment and Actual Number of Employees as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organizational structure of the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO). They are grouped under the Risk & Compliance Department for the purpose of presenting their functions.\n\n# Remuneration and Benefits Policy and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC),\" \"HKMA,\" \"remuneration,\" \"cash package,\" \"provident fund scheme,\" \"variable pay,\" \"fixed pay,\" and \"Governance Sub-Committee (GSC).\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"remuneration package,\" \"service conditions,\" and \"basic benefits.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"seeks the views of its Governance Sub-Committee,\" which is slightly awkward. Also, \"terms of service\" is less common than \"service conditions.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\" which is slightly redundant since EFAC is already defined.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"fixed pay (i.e., basic pay)\" which is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary term \"fixed pay\" and \"basic salary.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"under his jurisdiction\" which is unnecessary and adds a subjective tone.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"which is paid once a year\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"paid annually.\"\n- **Translation 6** is the most comprehensive, using both acronyms (FS, EFAC, GSC, HKMA) and providing a clear, fluent structure. However, it uses \"salary levels\" instead of \"remuneration levels,\" which is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary term \"remuneration.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, maintain fluency, and avoid redundancy or unnecessary phrasing.\n- It should use \"remuneration\" consistently, as per the dictionary, rather than \"salary.\"\n- The phrase \"determines the remuneration and service conditions\" is more natural than \"determines the remuneration and terms of service.\"\n- Including both the full name and acronym for \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Governance Sub-Committee\" improves clarity.\n- The phrase \"paid annually based on employee performance\" is more concise and natural than \"paid once a year based on the employee's performance.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its Governance Sub-Committee (GSC), and determines the remuneration and service conditions of HKMA staff by taking into account market remuneration levels and practices. The remuneration package includes a cash package and a provident fund scheme, along with some basic benefits. The cash package comprises monthly fixed pay (i.e., basic salary) and variable pay, which is paid annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with correct use of dictionary terms. However, the phrase “consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain advice from the Governance Sub-Committee” is slightly awkward. It would be clearer to specify that the advice comes from the GSC via the EFAC.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, but the phrase “seeking advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the performance of the Governance Sub-Committee” is slightly off. The GSC is not being assessed for performance; rather, it is providing advice on the HKMA’s performance.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. It correctly uses “salary surveys” instead of “remuneration survey,” which is slightly more colloquial but still acceptable. The phrase “adjusted separately” is slightly unclear, though it is understandable in context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly uses the abbreviations EFAC and GSC in parentheses, which improves clarity. The phrase “maintain their remuneration competitiveness” is slightly awkward, but it is still clear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. The phrase “solicit advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee through its Governance Sub-Committee” is slightly wordy but still clear. The use of “findings of a survey” is slightly more formal than “results of a survey,” which is acceptable.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate, but the phrase “seeking recommendations from its Governance Sub-Committee through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee” is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as the GSC seeking recommendations from the EFAC, which is not the case.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms (EFAC, GSC, HKMA, etc.).\n- Be grammatically correct and fluent.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing.\n- Maintain the nuance of the original text, particularly regarding the process of consultation and the rationale for special adjustments.\nBased on this, the fourth and fifth translations are the strongest, with the fourth being slightly more precise in its use of abbreviations and clarity in the consultation process.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the remuneration of HKMA employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) for recommendations from its Governance Sub-Committee (GSC), and considers the GSC’s assessment of HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a remuneration survey conducted by an independent human resources consultancy firm in the financial industry, and other relevant factors. Employees with outstanding individual performance may also receive special adjustments to maintain their remuneration competitiveness.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"variable pay,\" \"fixed pay,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" \"GSC,\" \"Division Head,\" and \"HKMA Chief Executive.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"remuneration\" and \"approval\" is appropriate and aligns with the formal tone of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"recuse themselves\" which is slightly more formal and legalistic than necessary, and \"the entire approved amount\" is less precise than \"the lump sum approved.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"disbursement\" and \"scheme,\" which are acceptable but not as commonly used in formal HR or governance contexts.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"absent from meetings\" which is less formal than \"excused from meetings\" or \"will not attend meetings.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"compensation\" instead of \"remuneration,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary term.\n- **Translation 5** is the most balanced, using \"excused from meetings\" and \"lump sum approved,\" which are both natural and precise.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"issuance of variable pay,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"distribution of variable pay.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"remuneration\" as per the dictionary, not \"compensation.\"\n- \"Excused from meetings\" is more natural and formal than \"absent from meetings\" or \"will not attend meetings.\"\n- \"Lump sum approved\" is more precise than \"total approved amount\" or \"entire approved amount.\"\n- \"Distribution of variable pay\" is more standard in HR and governance contexts than \"disbursement\" or \"issuance.\"\n- The phrase \"based on the Financial Secretary’s authorization\" is more natural than \"under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed pay and variable pay based on individual employees' performance; the variable pay system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed pay and distribution of variable pay for employees at the level of Executive Directors and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Sub-Committee, with the relevant employees excused from meetings when their remuneration proposals are discussed. For employees at the level of Division Head and below, adjustments to fixed pay and distribution of variable pay are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive, based on authorization from the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the lump sum approved for remuneration payments.\n\n# Executive Remuneration\n\nTable 2 lists the remuneration data of senior management in 2018.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual remuneration of employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual remuneration for the relevant position.  \n2. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of senior personnel at the HKMA includes the Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, the Commissioner of the Resolution Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Exchange Fund Investment Office.  \n3. Other benefits include the provident fund scheme or contractual remuneration (as applicable), medical and life insurance, as well as accumulated annual leave during the year. These benefits may vary depending on the individual service conditions of each senior personnel.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019

Report\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary (FS)\n\n# Opinions\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which are set out on pages 167 to 273. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2018, and the income and expenditure account, Statement of Comprehensive Income, statement of changes in equity, and Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and they present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2018, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date. They have also been prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in the audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe original title, \"# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值,\" translates to \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value.\" The dictionary provides exact translations for \"金融資產\" (financial assets), \"金融負債\" (financial liabilities), and \"公平值\" (fair value), which are all correctly used in the translations provided.\nAmong the junior translators' versions, several are very similar. The second, third, fifth, and sixth translations are nearly identical, using \"measured at fair value,\" which is a standard and accurate term in financial reporting. The first and fourth translations use \"carried at fair value\" and \"accounted for at fair value,\" respectively, which are also acceptable but slightly less common in modern financial terminology.\n\"Measured at fair value\" is the most precise and widely accepted term in accounting and financial reporting standards, such as IFRS and GAAP. It clearly conveys that the financial assets and liabilities are valued based on their fair market value. Therefore, the best translation would use this phrasing.\nValuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes to the Financial Statements 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe original sentence is a technical financial statement that describes how the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined, using either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are differences in fluency, clarity, and grammatical structure.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"fair value,\" \"financial assets,\" \"financial liabilities,\" \"quoted prices in active markets,\" \"valuation techniques,\" \"Level 1 inputs,\" and \"Level 2 inputs.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally clear, and the meaning is preserved across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is the most fluent and grammatically sound, with a natural flow and clear separation of the two valuation methods.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is slightly less direct than \"fair value is based on.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"valued at fair value using quoted prices,\" which is slightly redundant and less precise than \"based on.\"\n- **Translation 4** has awkward phrasing: \"the financial assets and all of the financial liabilities' fair value is based on...\" which is grammatically awkward.\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the best version, but \"have fair values based on\" is slightly less precise than \"the fair value is based on.\"\n- **Translation 6** omits \"similar\" in \"same assets or liabilities,\" which is a minor but important detail from the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- The best version should clearly state that the fair value is based on either quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or valuation techniques with observable market data (Level 2).\n- The phrase \"the same asset or liability\" should be used to match the original, which includes \"similar\" in the Chinese.\n- The sentence should be structured to clearly separate the two valuation methods without redundancy.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe fair value of 93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, numerical formatting, and the use of prepositions and verb tenses that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"financial assets,\" \"fair value,\" \"valuation techniques,\" \"Level 3 inputs,\" and \"unlisted investment funds.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"primarily consisting of\" or \"mainly consisting of\" is appropriate and natural in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical formatting:** There is inconsistency in the representation of the amount \"2,756.31億港元.\" Some translations use \"275.63 billion HKD\" (incorrectly omitting the comma and misplacing the decimal), while others use \"2,756.31 billion HKD\" (which is also incorrect, as the original is 2,756.31 billion HKD, not 2,756.31 billion). The correct format should be \"HKD 2,756.31 billion\" or \"HKD 2,756.31 billion.\"\n- **Verb tense:** Some translations use the present tense (\"is estimated\"), while others use the past tense (\"was estimated\"). The original text uses the past tense (\"是以估值方法估計\"), so the past tense is more appropriate.\n- **Prepositions and phrasing:** The phrase \"with parameters not based on observable market data\" is more concise and natural than \"and the parameters used were not based on observable market data.\"\n- **Currency symbol formatting:** Some translations use \"HK$275.631 billion\" while others use \"HKD 275.631 billion.\" The use of \"HKD\" is more standard in financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the numerical value is correctly formatted as \"HKD 2,756.31 billion.\"\n- Use the past tense (\"was estimated\") to match the original.\n- Use concise phrasing such as \"with parameters not based on observable market data.\"\n- Maintain consistency in the use of \"HKD\" as the currency symbol.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets totaled HKD 2,756.31 billion, primarily consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nThe original sentence discusses the importance of valuing financial assets and liabilities at fair value, given the large amounts involved and the use of estimates, and identifies this as a key audit matter. The dictionary provides exact translations for three terms: \"關鍵審計事項\" → \"Key audit matters\", \"金融負債\" → \"financial liabilities\", and \"公平值\" → \"fair value\".\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"Key audit matter\" should be \"Key audit matters\" (plural) as per the dictionary. Also, \"carried at fair value\" is slightly less precise than \"measured at fair value\" in accounting terminology.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Key audit matters\" correctly, but \"involvement of estimates\" is slightly awkward. \"Measured at fair value\" is better than \"carried at fair value\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The structure is clear and fluent, but \"significant amount\" should be \"significant amounts\" to match the original. Also, \"due to\" is a good choice, but the placement of the reason clause could be more natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"significant amounts\" and \"estimates required\" effectively, and \"measured at fair value\" is the correct accounting term. It also uses \"key audit matter\" in lowercase, which is appropriate unless it's a title.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is less precise than \"measured at fair value.\" Also, \"Key audit matter\" should be \"Key audit matters\" (plural).\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Similar to the fifth, but uses \"accounted for at fair value\" and \"large amount\" instead of \"significant amounts.\" The latter is less precise than the former.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Key audit matters\" (plural) as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"measured at fair value\" as the most accurate accounting term.\n- Use \"significant amounts\" to match the original's nuance.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent structure in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the estimates required, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about audit procedures related to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and prepositions that affect fluency and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n- **Translation 1 and 3 and 6** use \"accounted for at fair value.\" While grammatically correct, \"accounted for\" is more commonly used in contexts of accounting entries or recognition, not valuation. This may be slightly less precise in the context of fair value measurement.\n- **Translation 2, 4, and 5** use \"measured at fair value\" or \"carried at fair value.\" These are more precise in the context of financial reporting and valuation. \"Measured at fair value\" is the most standard and widely accepted phrasing in accounting and auditing literature.\n- **Translation 1 and 3** begin with \"Regarding the valuation...\" which is acceptable but slightly less direct than starting with \"The audit procedures for the valuation...\"\n- **Translation 6** omits the article \"the\" before \"audit procedures,\" which is a minor grammatical error.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"measured at fair value\" for precision, start with \"The audit procedures for the valuation...\" for clarity and directness, and ensure proper grammar and article usage. The dictionary terms \"金融資產\" and \"金融負債\" are correctly translated as \"financial assets\" and \"financial liabilities,\" respectively, and \"公平值\" is correctly rendered as \"fair value.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\n- Understand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including relevant monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including those related to application program monitoring in computer systems;  \n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If market quotes are used, verify the prices based on independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original title, \"# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值,\" is a heading or subheading likely used in a financial or accounting document. The key terms are \"投資物業\" (investment properties) and \"公平值\" (fair value), both of which have exact translation options in the dictionary.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **First junior translator**: \"The investment properties, which are accounted for at fair value, are being valued.\"  \n   - This is a full sentence, but it is not appropriate as a title. It reads more like a statement than a heading. Also, \"accounted for\" is less precise than \"carried at\" or \"measured at\" in accounting terminology.\n2. **Second junior translator**: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\"  \n   - This is a strong title, but \"accounted for\" is not the most precise term in accounting contexts. \"Carried at\" or \"measured at\" are more standard.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Same as the second, so the same evaluation applies.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: \"Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value.\"  \n   - This is a good title, with \"measured at\" being a standard accounting term. However, \"investment properties\" is lowercase, which may be inconsistent with the title style.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\"  \n   - This is a strong title. \"Carried at\" is a standard term in accounting for assets measured at fair value. The capitalization is consistent with a title.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: \"# Valuation of Investment Properties Recorded at Fair Value\"  \n   - The use of \"#\" is likely a formatting artifact and not part of the original text. \"Recorded at\" is not the standard term in accounting; \"carried at\" or \"measured at\" are more appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best translation**:  \nThe most accurate and natural translation would use \"carried at\" as it is the standard accounting term for assets measured at fair value. The title should be concise, grammatically correct, and use proper capitalization. The use of \"#\" should be omitted unless it is part of the original formatting, which it is not in the original text.\n**Final translation**:  \nValuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes to the Financial Statements 2.12, 20, and 21.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"投資物業\" as \"investment properties,\" \"公平值\" as \"fair value,\" \"聯營公司\" as \"associate,\" \"合營公司\" as \"joint venture,\" \"主要業務\" as \"principal activities,\" and \"估值方法\" as \"valuation techniques.\" However, there are a few notable issues:\n1. **Numerical Accuracy**: The sixth translation incorrectly uses \"HKD 253.21 billion\" and \"HKD 443.36 billion\" instead of the correct \"HK$25.321 billion\" and \"HK$44.336 billion.\" This is a critical error that affects the accuracy of the financial figures.\n2. **Consistency in Terminology**: While all translations use the correct dictionary terms, some variations in phrasing exist, such as \"accounted for at fair value\" versus \"carried at fair value\" versus \"stated at fair value.\" These are all acceptable, but \"accounted for at fair value\" is more standard in financial reporting.\n3. **Fluency and Style**: The translations vary slightly in fluency. For example, the third and fourth translations use \"totaling\" and \"amounting to,\" which are both correct but slightly different in tone. The second and fifth translations use \"the total value of these interests amounting to,\" which is slightly more formal and precise.\n4. **Clarity and Structure**: The sixth translation has a minor grammatical issue: \"3 associate and 20 joint venture\" should be \"3 associates and 20 joint ventures.\" Additionally, \"significant judgment and estimates\" should be \"significant judgments and estimates\" to match the plural form of \"judgments.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and precision of the second and fifth translations, correct the numerical errors from the sixth, and ensure grammatical accuracy and consistency in terminology.\n---\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, amounting to HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in three associates and 20 joint ventures, whose principal activities involve holding overseas investment properties, with the total value of these interests amounting to HK$44.336 billion. Regardless of whether these investment properties are held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, their fair value is primarily determined based on valuations conducted by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：**\nThe dictionary specifies that **投資物業** must be translated as **investment properties** and **公平值** as **fair value**.\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of dictionary terms, clear and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly formal tone due to \"Regarding,\" which may be less common in professional audit contexts.\n2. **Translation 2:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Direct and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy due to the repetition of \"valuation of.\"\n3. **Translation 3:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Measured at fair value\" is less standard in accounting terminology than \"accounted for at fair value\" or \"carried at fair value.\"\n4. **Translation 4:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties carried at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Carried at fair value\" is a standard accounting term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more formal than necessary for the context.\n5. **Translation 5:**  \n   *\"The audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Valuing\" is a gerund, which may be less formal than \"valuation of.\"\n6. **Translation 6:**  \n   *\"Regarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, audit procedures include:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as Translation 1.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as Translation 1.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe most natural and standard phrasing in accounting and auditing contexts is **\"accounted for at fair value\"** or **\"carried at fair value.\"** Between these, **\"accounted for at fair value\"** is more commonly used in IFRS and GAAP contexts. The phrase **\"audit procedures for the valuation of\"** is slightly wordy, while **\"audit procedures for valuing\"** is more concise and natural.\nThe best balance of clarity, conciseness, and standard terminology is achieved by using **\"accounted for at fair value\"** and **\"audit procedures for valuing.\"**\n### Final Translation:\n**The audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:**\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports on investment properties directly held by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluate whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe original text states that the \"金融管理專員\" (Monetary Authority) is responsible for \"其他資料\" (other information), which includes all information in the \"金融管理局2018年年報\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2018 Annual Report), except for \"財務報表\" (financial statements) and \"我的審計師報告\" (my auditor's report).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly. The phrase \"is responsible for other information\" is accurate. However, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report for 2018\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Similar to the first, but uses \"2018 Annual Report\" instead of \"Annual Report for 2018,\" which is more natural. Also uses \"auditors' report\" with an apostrophe, which is correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently and \"data\" instead of \"information,\" which is less precise. \"Other data\" is not as clear as \"other information.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Incorrectly refers to \"Financial Management Department\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the term in the dictionary is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" appropriately. The phrase \"but excludes\" is more natural than \"excluding.\" Also uses \"auditor’s report\" with an apostrophe, which is correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly. The phrase \"within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report for 2018\" is slightly wordy but grammatically correct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as the full name, as it is the most specific and accurate term from the dictionary.\n- Use \"information\" rather than \"data\" for \"其他資料\" to maintain clarity and consistency with the original.\n- Use \"Annual Report\" without the word \"for\" to make the phrase more concise and natural.\n- Use \"auditor’s report\" with an apostrophe to reflect possession correctly.\n- Avoid any incorrect substitutions, such as \"Financial Management Department.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This information includes all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2018 Annual Report, but excludes the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, nor do I issue any form of attestation conclusion regarding other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information and consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements. The key elements to preserve are the proper names and the hierarchical relationship between the entities.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The sentence structure is awkward and unclear. \"The Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s responsibilities regarding the financial statements\" is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to the financial statements\" misplaces the Audit Sub-Committee, suggesting it is under both the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which is not accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's Audit Sub-Committee bear responsibilities regarding the financial statements\" is grammatically correct but lacks clarity in the relationship between the entities.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\" is clear and grammatically correct, but the phrase \"under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" might be misinterpreted as the Monetary Authority being under the EFAC.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements\" is clear and grammatically correct, with a more precise structure.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\" is very similar to the fourth translation and suffers from the same potential ambiguity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly indicate that the Audit Sub-Committee is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and that both the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee have responsibilities regarding the financial statements. The structure should reflect the hierarchical relationship accurately and clearly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of terminology, structure, and precision. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and correctly references the \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\" However, the phrase \"must be responsible for preparing\" is slightly wordy compared to \"is responsible for preparing.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and the correct terminology. The structure is concise and natural, with \"in accordance with\" and \"instructions issued by\" being appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"as it considers necessary\" instead of \"that it considers necessary,\" which is slightly less precise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second, with the same strengths. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and the correct terminology. The structure is slightly more wordy, but still fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and the correct terminology. The structure is clear and natural, with a slight preference for \"given\" over \"issued\" for \"instructions.\" The use of \"It must also implement\" adds clarity by separating the two main responsibilities.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority,\" which is not the preferred term in the dictionary. This is a critical error, as \"Monetary Authority\" is the correct term for \"金融管理專員\" in this context. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" and the correct terminology. The use of \"HKICPA\" is appropriate, and the structure is concise and natural. The phrase \"directions issued by\" is slightly less common than \"instructions issued by,\" but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"金融管理專員\" should be translated as \"Monetary Authority\" (not \"Financial Management Commissioner\").\n- The term \"香港會計師公會\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants\" or \"HKICPA.\"\n- The term \"《香港財務報告準則》\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.\"\n- The term \"《外匯基金條例》\" should be translated as \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n- The term \"行政長官\" should be translated as \"Chief Executive.\"\n- The term \"財務報表\" should be translated as \"financial statements.\"\nThe best translation should use \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" and \"Chief Executive\" consistently. It should also use natural English phrasing, such as \"in accordance with\" and \"instructions issued by.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting an official or institutional context. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning accurately, but there are subtle differences in word choice and style that affect fluency and formality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)\" as per the dictionary.\n- The use of \"overseeing\" or \"supervising\" is appropriate, though \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal institutional contexts.\n- The inclusion of \"EFAC\" in the fourth translation adds clarity for readers familiar with the acronym.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"supervising,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise than \"overseeing\" in this context.\n- The fourth translation is the only one that includes the acronym \"EFAC\" in parentheses, which is a minor but useful addition for clarity.\n- The use of \"group's\" with an apostrophe is consistent across translations, though \"Group\" with a capital \"G\" might be more appropriate in formal institutional writing, depending on the organization's style guide.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- \"Overseeing\" is more natural and commonly used in formal institutional writing than \"supervising.\"\n- Including the acronym \"EFAC\" in parentheses after the full name enhances clarity and is a minor but valuable addition.\n- Capitalizing \"Group\" may be appropriate if it refers to a specific, named entity, though this depends on context not provided here.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \nUnderstand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;  \nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;  \nDetermine whether the Monetary Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline of the plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identified during the audit.\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline of the plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several strengths and weaknesses are evident. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" or \"EFAC,\" \"關鍵審計事項\" as \"Key audit matters,\" \"財務報表\" as \"financial statements,\" and \"審核委員會\" as \"Audit Sub-Committee.\" This is a positive consistency across all translations.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, the translations are generally accurate, though some exhibit minor issues. For example, the first junior translator uses \"I will determine\" and \"I will describe,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly repetitive. The second and third translators use \"I determine\" and \"I describe,\" which is more concise but may be less formal. The fourth and fifth translators use \"I will determine\" and \"I will describe,\" which is consistent and formal, aligning well with the tone of an audit report.\nThe use of vocabulary is mostly appropriate, though some translations could be more precise. For instance, the phrase \"public interest derived from such communication\" in the second translation is slightly awkward compared to \"public interest generated by such communication\" in the third and fourth translations. Additionally, the phrase \"in which case I will decide not to communicate the matter in the report\" in the fourth and fifth translations is more concise and natural than \"and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report\" used in the first and third translations.\nCulturally, all translations are appropriate for an audit report, maintaining the formal and professional tone required. However, the use of \"EFAC\" as an acronym is not consistently applied across all translations, which may affect clarity for readers unfamiliar with the term.\nImprovements could include ensuring consistent use of \"EFAC\" where appropriate, refining phrasing for clarity and conciseness, and ensuring that the conditional clauses are clearly structured to reflect the legal and regulatory nuances of the original text.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone, use \"EFAC\" consistently, and ensure clarity and precision in the conditional clauses.\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), I will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the current period, thereby constituting Key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report unless disclosure of a matter is prohibited by law or regulation, or in extremely rare circumstances where the adverse consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest generated by its disclosure, in which case I will decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nDirector of Audit Zhu Nai Zhang\nThe review of the junior translators' work reveals several key issues. First, the title \"審計署署長\" is correctly translated as \"Director of Audit\" in all submissions, which aligns with the dictionary entry. However, the transliteration of the name \"朱乃璋\" shows inconsistencies.\nThe name \"朱乃璋\" should be transliterated as \"Zhu Nai Zhang\" according to standard Pinyin conventions. The first junior translator correctly used this form. However, the second and third translators used \"Chu\" instead of \"Zhu,\" which is incorrect. \"Chu\" is typically used for the surname \"朱\" in Cantonese romanization, but since the text is in Traditional Chinese and not specifically tied to a Cantonese context, the Mandarin Pinyin \"Zhu\" is more appropriate.\nThe fourth junior translator used \"Zhu Nai-chang,\" which incorrectly splits the character \"璋\" into \"chang\" instead of \"zhang.\" The fifth junior translator used \"Zhu Nai Wang,\" which is a complete misrepresentation of the name. The sixth junior translator used \"Chu Nai-cheung,\" which again mixes Cantonese romanization with incorrect character transliteration.\nBased on this review, the best approach is to use the standard Mandarin Pinyin transliteration \"Zhu Nai Zhang\" for the name \"朱乃璋,\" ensuring consistency with the dictionary entry and proper linguistic conventions.\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
