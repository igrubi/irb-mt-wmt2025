{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Over the past ten years, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant changes, with many episodes beyond the imagination of even the best scriptwriters. In last year’s annual report, I noted that the 2017 financial market performance was \"surprisingly good,\" while also mentioning that the outlook \"concealed hidden concerns.\" Looking back at 2018, it might be described as \"started well but ended off-colour.\" Shortly after global stock indices reached record highs in January, the bullish investment sentiment quickly encountered the cold front of US-China trade tensions, compounded by the ongoing Brexit impasse, worsening geopolitical conditions, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. These factors led to a sharp reversal of the optimistic market sentiment, resulting in a significant decline in asset prices throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell 20.3% from its peak to its trough, ending the year with a drop of approximately 10%, marking its worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its peak, declining by 13.6% for the year, recording its largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: Resilient, the Foundation of Confidence\n\nDespite volatile external conditions, Hong Kong’s financial system remains resilient, and the currency market operates smoothly. The Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented for 35 years, has successfully coped with the challenge of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HK$10,000 billion worth of funds has flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to an increase in \"sell Hong Kong dollars, buy U.S. dollars\" carry trade activities. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the U.S. dollar weakened at the beginning of the year. The \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking,\" established in 2005, was first triggered in April and triggered 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fulfilled the \"buy Hong Kong dollars, sell U.S. dollars\" Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking in accordance with the established mechanism, orderly and transparently absorbing HK$103.5 billion of Hong Kong dollar selling pressure in the market. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) recorded a cumulative increase of 105 basis points in 2018, and banks also adjusted upwards their prime lending rates following the U.S. interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and at appropriate times explained the operational mechanism of the \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable process of interest rate normalization in Hong Kong and also a normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Hong Kong Linked Exchange Rate System at the end of last year, and the HKSAR government also emphasized that the Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s currency stability. This has helped to stabilize the confidence of the people of Hong Kong in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\n# The original text, “銀行體系 穩中有進,” translates to “Banking system: with stronger resilience and progress.” The junior translators have provided several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1: “The banking sector with stronger resilience and progress.” This version is grammatically correct but lacks a clear structure. It reads as a fragment rather than a complete sentence.\nTranslation 2: “Banking System: With Stronger Resilience and Progress.” This is a clear and concise translation, but it uses all caps for “Banking System,” which may not be necessary unless it's a title.\nTranslation 3: “Banking Sector: With Stronger Resilience and Progress.” This is very similar to Translation 2, but uses “Sector” instead of “System.” Both are acceptable, but “system” may be more accurate given the term “體系.”\nTranslation 4: “The banking sector is developing with stronger resilience.” This translation adds the verb “is developing,” which is not present in the original text. While it may be a reasonable interpretation, it introduces new information not in the original.\nTranslation 5: “Banking system with stronger resilience, progress.” This version is grammatically incomplete and lacks a clear structure. It also uses a comma instead of a conjunction, which may confuse the reader.\nTranslation 6: “Banking system: with stronger resilience and making progress.” This is a good attempt, but “making progress” is slightly more verbose than necessary. “Progress” alone would be sufficient.\nBased on the above analysis, the best approach would be to use “Banking system: with stronger resilience and progress.” This version is concise, grammatically correct, and accurately reflects the original text. It uses the correct terms from the dictionary and maintains the intended meaning.\nThe final translation is:\nBanking system: with stronger resilience and progress.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed latent flaws and risks in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to introduce a series of reforms targeting financial markets and financial institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in the banking sector. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) banking supervision focuses on two key areas: first, prudent supervision of banks' asset-liability risks; and second, banks' conduct standards, neither of which should be neglected. In terms of asset-liability risk supervision, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA has the responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards, ensuring that the Hong Kong banking sector operates prudently and soundly. By the end of last year, the capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong banks reached 20.3%, which is significantly higher than the international minimum standard of 8% and also a marked increase from the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. Large banks' average liquidity coverage ratio reached 167.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the global financial crisis, where public funds had to be used to rescue \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, the Financial Stability Board has established international standards for the resolution mechanisms of financial institutions. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that have fully implemented mechanisms meeting the requirements. The HKMA's Resolution Mechanism Office is implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to implement structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the \"Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules,\" and more related rules will be introduced in the future.\n\nIn view of the continued rise in housing prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority took preemptive actions and launched a total of eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that, in the event of a reversal in the property market, the local banking system would have sufficient resilience to cope with shocks. These measures proved highly effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also declined from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. During the year, banking credit recorded a moderate growth of 4.4%, with overall asset quality remaining good, and the non-performing loan ratio in retail banking further dropped to 0.5%, well below the international and local historical averages. Last year, the banking sector's profitability continued to grow, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups performed well in Hong Kong, becoming important pillars of their group's profitability.\n\n# Sound and Virtuous Culture: Leadership by Example Influences All Levels\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality and accuracy. The first translation, \"Sound and Virtuous Culture: Lead by Example,\" is concise and captures the essence of the phrase, but it omits the full meaning of the original text. The second translation, \"Stable and virtuous culture, with top-down influence and bottom-up emulation,\" is more comprehensive but uses \"stable\" instead of \"sound\" and adds \"emulation\" which is not explicitly in the original text. The third translation, \"Sound and virtuous culture – leadership by example,\" is similar to the first but lacks the full context. The fourth translation, \"Sound culture, sector to stability,\" is confusing and does not accurately reflect the original meaning. The fifth translation, \"Stable and Virtuous Culture: Upper Level Leads, Lower Level Follows,\" is more accurate but uses \"stable\" instead of \"sound\" and is somewhat awkward in phrasing. The sixth translation, \"Sound and Virtuous Culture: The Upper Levels Lead by Example, Influencing the Lower Levels,\" is the most comprehensive and accurate, capturing the full meaning of the original text.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that accurately reflects the original meaning, uses the correct terms from the dictionary, and is fluent and natural in English. The translation should use \"sound\" for \"穩\" and \"culture\" for \"文化,\" and it should convey the idea of leadership by example influencing all levels. The final translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to regulate bank conduct and promote a sound banking culture. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nStrengths include the consistent use of \"Bank Conduct Department\" and \"HKMA\" as the correct translations for \"銀行操守部\" and \"金管局,\" respectively. The translations also generally convey the intent of promoting fair treatment of customers and strengthening consumer protection. The use of \"sound culture\" and \"three pillars\" is accurate and aligns with the dictionary's suggested translations for \"穩善文化\" and \"三大支柱.\"\nWeaknesses include inconsistencies in the translation of terms like \"推動\" (promote, drive, encourage, etc.) and \"評估\" (assessment, self-assessment, evaluation). Some translations use \"promote\" consistently, while others use \"drive\" or \"encourage,\" which may not always be the best fit. Additionally, the phrase \"標本兼治\" is translated as \"both symptomatic and root-cause solutions\" or \"both symptoms and root causes,\" which is accurate but could be more concise.\nThe term \"全港\" is translated as \"across all 18 districts of Hong Kong\" in one translation, which is overly specific and not necessary. The dictionary provides \"Territory-Wide\" as an alternative, which is more appropriate and concise.\nThe phrase \"三大支柱\" is translated as \"three pillars\" in all translations, which is correct. However, the use of \"sound bank culture\" is more consistent than \"sound banking culture\" or \"sound culture.\"\nThe term \"落實\" is translated as \"implementation\" or \"implementing,\" which is accurate. However, \"put in place\" or \"operationalising\" could also be considered, though \"implementation\" is the most common and natural choice.\nThe phrase \"上行下效\" is translated as \"lead by example\" or \"permeates from top to bottom,\" which captures the intended meaning. However, \"lead by example\" is more concise and natural in English.\nThe term \"自我評估\" is consistently translated as \"self-assessment,\" which is correct.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are generally well-written, but some use passive voice unnecessarily, which can make the text feel less direct. For example, \"the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on bank culture\" is more direct than \"regulatory measures on bank culture were further introduced.\"\nOverall, the best translation would combine the strengths of all six, ensuring consistency in terminology, fluency, and accuracy. It would use \"promote\" for \"推動,\" \"self-assessment\" for \"自我評估,\" and \"sound culture\" for \"穩善文化.\" It would also avoid overly specific translations like \"across all 18 districts of Hong Kong\" and use \"Territory-Wide\" instead.\nThe final translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English, while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms provided.\nHere is the improved translation:\nIn terms of regulating the conduct of banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Banking Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes, in addition to setting out various regulatory requirements targeting the basic conduct of bank operations, we have vigorously promoted reforms in banking culture in recent years, encouraging banks to promote a sound culture through governance, reward systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms. We aim to ensure that good conduct permeates from top to bottom within banks, fundamentally restoring and enhancing customers’ trust and respect for banks. Following the provision of specific guidelines to all banks in Hong Kong in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on banking culture by the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, enabling the three pillars of a sound banking culture to be effectively implemented.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote inclusive finance last year, meeting the needs of communities unable to adopt new technologies. For example, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to drive the launch of elderly-friendly cash withdrawal services at convenience stores through the \"Electronic Payment Services\" platform, with the convenience store network expanding to over 300 stores. We also contacted Hong Kong Post to introduce the \"Elderly Cash Withdrawal\" service at seven major post offices located in outlying islands and the New Territories. The banking industry responded to the HKMA's recommendations by actively increasing barrier-free facilities and providing inclusive banking services for people with disabilities and the general public. One example is the number of voice-guided ATMs, which increased more than tenfold within a year to over 700 units. Additionally, under the HKMA's active promotion, we expect banks to gradually establish more physical branches in remote areas and introduce mobile banking services, enhancing convenience for the public.\n\n# Smart Banking: A New Experience\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify key terms such as \"金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), \"轉數快\" (FPS), and \"共用二維碼\" (shared QR code).\n- The translations are fluent and maintain the formal tone appropriate for a government or financial institution's announcement.\n- Most translations use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" consistently for \"轉數快,\" which aligns with the dictionary's \"Faster\" and \"FPS\" options.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"fintech\" without fully justifying it in context, while others use \"financial technology\" more consistently.\n- The term \"市民\" is translated as \"public\" or \"citizens,\" which is acceptable, but \"the public\" is more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"短短半年\" is translated as \"in just half a year\" or \"in the short span of just six months.\" The former is more concise and natural.\n- The dictionary specifies \"萬個\" should be translated as \"million,\" but some translations use \"2.58 million accounts\" instead of \"2.58 million,\" which is more precise.\n- The term \"日均交易量\" is translated as \"average daily transaction volume,\" which is accurate, but \"daily average transaction volume\" is also acceptable.\n- Some translations use \"registered users\" instead of \"registration records,\" which is a slight deviation from the original text.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"financial technology\" consistently for \"金融科技\" unless \"fintech\" is more natural in context.\n- Use \"the public\" for \"市民\" to maintain a formal tone.\n- Translate \"短短半年\" as \"in just half a year\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"2.58 million\" instead of \"2.58 million accounts\" to match the original's \"萬個.\"\n- Use \"average daily transaction volume\" for \"日均交易量.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most appropriate and contextually accurate English alternatives.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority closely collaborated with banks and the technology industry to launch the \"Smart Banking New Era\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of Hong Kong's financial technology and offering the public a brand-new experience in payment and banking services. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) in September. It is a globally unique retail fast payment system that breaks down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing the public to enjoy 24\/7 real-time fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also simultaneously launched the world's first \"shared QR code\" standard and application, enabling merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems through a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been widely welcomed by the public. In just half a year, registration records have exceeded 2.58 million, with an average daily transaction volume of 60,000 transactions, averaging 20,700 Hong Kong dollars and 38,000 renminbi per transaction respectively.\n\nIn May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the authorization of virtual banks, followed by 33 institutions submitting applications for virtual bank licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have already been issued, and they are expected to officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks help promote the development and innovation of Hong Kong's financial technology, providing individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises with new services and experiences, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open API framework in July. Banks will open external interfaces for their products and services in four phases, creating a more flexible and open fintech environment, enabling bank customers to more conveniently integrate account information, obtain information, and select services that better meet their needs. Throughout the year, a total of 42 new technology products used the HKMA’s fintech regulatory sandbox for testing, among which 28 completed trials, and the related products and services have already been successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with multiple banks, officially launched \"eTradeConnect\" in October last year. This trade financing platform, which adopts \"distributed ledger technology,\" will enhance the efficiency of banks in approving trade financing. \"eTradeConnect\" is currently testing connections with related platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFintech has not only been widely applied in daily life, but in recent years it has also entered the fields of compliance and regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages banks to use compliance technology (Regtech) to assist in handling day-to-day operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Consolidate and Enhance Financial Strength\n\nThe competition between international financial centres is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in economic, social, and technological development, seize opportunities, and constantly open up new areas of development for Hong Kong's financial sector. Green finance represents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project financing markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and collaborates with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in developing green finance. In addition to supporting the Government's preparatory work for the issuance plan of HKD 1,000 billion in government green bonds, we held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two large-scale international conferences, to enhance the market's understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the Government's green bond subsidy scheme launched last year and the green finance certification service in Hong Kong. The amount of green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded USD 11 billion, which is more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown growing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016. The number of its collaborating partners has more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for exchange in infrastructure financing within the region. Last year, the HKMA co-hosted its first high-level roundtable meeting with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council, discussing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role in supporting central state-owned enterprises' \"going global\" initiatives. This laid a solid foundation for future collaborative expansion of development opportunities between central state-owned enterprises and Hong Kong's financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

This is the first time since the HKMA introduced three initiatives to optimize the Linked Exchange Rate System in 2005 that the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking has been triggered. In 2018, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times.\n\n# July 24\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and three note-issuing banks announced the launch of the 2018 Hong Kong new series banknotes.\n\n# October 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as primary liquidity providers in Hong Kong's offshore renminbi market.\n\n# Banking System\n\n# January 10\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding a policy change by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The key elements are the date (2019年1月1日), the entity (金管局), the policy (逆周期緩衝資本), and the change (由1.875%上調至2.5%).\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"countercyclical buffer capital\" correctly. The phrase \"effective from January 1, 2019\" is natural. However, \"was increased\" implies a past action, which may not align with the formal tone of the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation uses \"announces\" and \"adjusted upwards,\" which are appropriate. However, \"effective from January 1, 2019\" is slightly awkward compared to \"effective January 1, 2019.\" Also, \"Hong Kong's\" may be redundant if the subject is already clear.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and natural. \"Has been increased to 2.5% from 1.875%\" is a clear and formal expression. However, the structure \"applicable to Hong Kong\" is slightly less precise than \"applicable in Hong Kong.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of \"will increase\" introduces a future tense, which may not match the original's tone of a completed policy change. \"Applicable to Hong Kong\" is slightly less precise than \"applicable in Hong Kong.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural. \"Will be raised\" is appropriate for a policy change. However, \"starting from\" is slightly informal compared to \"effective from.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The use of \"published\" is less appropriate than \"announces\" or \"announced\" in this context. \"Adjusted upwards\" is correct, but \"effective January 1, 2019\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"announced\" to reflect the formal nature of the announcement, \"effective January 1, 2019\" for clarity, and \"adjusted upwards\" or \"raised\" to reflect the policy change. \"Applicable in Hong Kong\" is more precise than \"applicable to Hong Kong.\" The use of \"from 1.875% to 2.5%\" is clear and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that, effective January 1, 2019, the countercyclical buffer capital applicable in Hong Kong will be raised from 1.875% to 2.5%.\n\n# February 2nd\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of a revised ordinance related to anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to render the text into English, though with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Ordinance to Amend the 2018 Ordinance\" which is redundant and awkward. The term \"Countering\" is not in the dictionary, and \"counter-financing\" is not the best fit for \"籌集\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is more concise and uses \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" which aligns with the dictionary. However, \"Amendment\" is placed incorrectly, and the structure is slightly off.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"Combat\" is not in the dictionary, and \"Combat\" is not a direct translation of \"打擊.\" The placement of \"2018\" at the end is also unconventional in legal terminology.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The translation is concise but lacks proper capitalization and structure. \"Amendment Ordinance\" is not the standard legal phrasing.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly uses \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" and places \"Amendment\" appropriately. However, \"is gazetted\" is less formal than \"has been gazetted.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the least accurate. It uses lowercase for \"anti-money laundering\" and \"financial institutions,\" which is not standard in legal documents. Also, \"revised\" is not the best fit for \"修訂\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"2018\" as a prefix, as it is a year and typically placed at the beginning.\n- Use \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Amendment\" as a noun, not a verb.\n- Use \"Ordinance\" with proper capitalization.\n- Use \"has been gazetted\" for formality and accuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 2018 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance has been gazetted.\n\n# February 28\nThe original text is a simple date: \"2月28日,\" which translates to \"February 28\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating the characters \"月\" (month), \"2\" (2 or two), \"日\" (day, dates, or Day), and \"28\" (28). The space \" \" is to be translated as an empty string, meaning it should be omitted.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"February 28th\"** – This is grammatically correct but adds an unnecessary \"th\" suffix, which is not standard in formal or neutral English date formats. It is more common to write \"February 28\" without the ordinal suffix unless specifying a particular day in a narrative context.\n2. **\" # 2月28日\"** – This is a direct copy of the original text with a hashtag, which is not a proper English translation. It fails to translate the characters and retains the Chinese format.\n3. **\"February 28\"** – This is a correct and concise translation. It uses the proper month name and numerical day format, which is standard in English.\n4. **\" # 2 month 28 day\"** – This translation is awkward and overly literal. It uses \"month\" and \"day\" as separate words, which is not standard in English date formatting. The hashtag is also unnecessary.\n5. **\"two day 28\"** – This is incorrect in both grammar and format. \"Two day 28\" is not a standard way to express a date in English and is confusing.\n6. **\"February 28\"** – This is identical to the third translation and is correct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and follow standard English date formatting. \"February 28\" is the most appropriate choice as it uses the correct month name, numerical day format, and omits unnecessary elements like the ordinal suffix or literal translations of \"month\" and \"day.\" It also adheres to the dictionary by using \"February\" for \"月\" and \"28\" for \"28,\" while omitting the space as instructed.\n**Final Translation:**\nFebruary 28\n\nThe original text discusses the Financial Stability Board's report on Hong Kong's progress in reforming the over-the-counter derivatives market and establishing a financial institution resolution framework. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"interbank review\" and \"establishment of financial institution resolution framework.\" The term \"interbank review\" is not in the dictionary, and \"establishment\" is not the best fit for \"設立.\" The translation is fluent but not fully aligned with the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"review report\" and \"establishing a framework for the resolution of financial institutions.\" \"Review report\" is not in the dictionary, and \"resolution of financial institutions\" is not the best match for \"處置.\" The translation is accurate but slightly off in terminology.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"interbank assessment\" and \"financial institution resolution framework.\" \"Interbank assessment\" is not in the dictionary, but the rest is accurate. The translation is fluent and adheres well to the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"peer review report\" and \"establishing a financial institution resolution framework.\" \"Peer review report\" is not in the dictionary, but the rest is accurate. The translation is fluent and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"interbank peer review\" and \"set up of a framework for the resolution of financial institutions.\" \"Interbank peer review\" is not in the dictionary, and \"set up\" is not the best fit for \"設立.\" The translation is accurate but slightly off in terminology.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"concerning Hong Kong\" and \"establishment of a financial institutions resolution framework.\" \"Concerning\" is not the best fit for \"發出,\" and \"financial institutions\" should be singular. The translation is accurate but lacks fluency.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, maintain fluency, and convey the intended meaning. The term \"發出\" should be translated as \"published\" or \"issued.\" \"確認\" should be \"recognising.\" \"處置\" should be \"resolution.\" \"設立\" should be \"establishing.\" \"同業\" should be \"interbank.\" \"報告\" should be \"report.\" \"進展理想\" should be \"substantial progress.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Stability Board published a report on Hong Kong's interbank peer review, recognising substantial progress in recent years in reforming the over-the-counter derivatives market and establishing a financial institution resolution framework.\n\n# March 23\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority facilitated the Hong Kong Association of Banks in issuing the \"Guideline on Barrier-Free Banking Services.\"\n\n# May 4th\n\nThe 2018 Banking (Disclosure) (Amendment) Rules and the 2018 Banking (Specified Multilateral Development Banks) (Amendment) Notice have been gazetted.\n\n# May 18\n\nThe original text is a formal legal notice announcing the gazetting of two documents: the \"2018 Banking (Amendment) Ordinance (Effective Date) Notice\" and the \"Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules.\" The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate in terms of structure, but it misrepresents the title of the first document. It reads as if it is a \"Notice of the Gazette of the Ordinance,\" which is not the case. The original text refers to the \"Notice\" as part of the title, not as a separate entity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"have been gazetted\" as a verb, which is grammatically incorrect in this context. The verb \"gazetted\" should be used as an adjective or past participle, not as a verb in the present perfect tense.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly identifies the titles of the two documents and uses \"gazetted\" as an adjective, which is appropriate in legal contexts. However, it could be slightly more formal by using \"have been gazetted\" instead of \"gazetted\" alone.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is awkward and unclear. It uses \"gazetted Rules on Exposure Limits for Banking Risks,\" which is not the correct structure. The original text refers to the \"Rules\" as a separate document, not as a rule about banking risks.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the correct structure. It uses \"gazetted\" as an adjective and correctly identifies the titles of the documents. However, it omits the word \"Notice\" in the first title, which is part of the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of the dictionary terms used, but it misplaces the word \"Notice\" in the title. It reads as if the \"Notice\" is part of the amendment, which is not the case.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the titles of the two documents.\n- Use \"gazetted\" as an adjective to describe the documents.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for legal notices.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated correctly and consistently.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n**The \"Notice on the Effective Date of the 2018 Banking (Amendment) Ordinance\" and the \"Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules\" have been gazetted.**\n\n# May 30\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在經完成公眾諮詢後發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The HKMA following consultation publishes the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Guideline\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Following consultation\" is awkward and lacks clarity. \"Virtual banks\" should be capitalized as \"Virtual Banks\" for consistency with the dictionary.  \n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The HKMA publishes the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks following the completion of public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of \"HKMA,\" \"Guideline,\" \"Virtual Banks,\" and \"public consultation.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Authorization\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's a proper noun.  \n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"HKMA published the revised edition of the 'Authorization of Virtual Banks' guideline following the completion of public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"revised edition\" and \"guideline.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" should be \"The HKMA\" for formality. \"Guideline\" is lowercase, which is acceptable but inconsistent with the dictionary.  \n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"HKMA publishes the revised guideline on the authorization of virtual banks following the completion of public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Natural flow and correct use of \"guideline\" and \"virtual banks.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" should be \"The HKMA\" for formality. \"Authorization\" is lowercase, which is acceptable but may be capitalized depending on context.  \n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The HKMA published a revised version of the 'Authorization of Virtual Banks' guideline following the completion of public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"revised version\" and \"guideline.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Published\" is in past tense, but the original sentence uses \"發出\" (issued), which is more neutral and can be in present tense.  \n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority publishes the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks following the completion of public consultation.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Full name of the authority is used, which is more formal.

The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is concise but lacks clarity in structure. It uses \"Rules on Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism)\" which is awkward. Also, \"Taxation (Amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance Draft\" is not grammatically correct.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is more fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"Resolution Regime\" for \"處置機制\" and \"Loss-absorbing Capacity Requirement\" for \"吸收虧損能力規定.\" However, \"related draft 2018 taxation (amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"banks\" instead of \"Banking Sector\" is less precise. Also, \"Tax (Amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance 2018\" is not in the correct order and lacks clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is well-structured and accurate. It uses \"Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements for the Banking Sector under the Resolution Mechanism of Financial Institutions\" which is clear and precise. However, \"Ordinance Draft\" is not standard legal terminology.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is overly convoluted and uses \"Ability of Financial Institutions to Absorb Losses\" which is not as precise as \"Loss-absorbing Capacity.\" Also, \"Draft Ordinance\" is not clearly connected to the rest of the sentence.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is close to being correct but ends with \"草案\" which is not translated. It should be \"Draft\" instead of \"草案.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and grammatically correct. It should use the dictionary terms accurately and maintain the legal tone of the original text. The structure should clearly indicate the gazetting of the rules and the related draft ordinance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"Rules on the Resolution Mechanism for Financial Institutions (Loss-absorbing Capacity Requirements — Banking Sector)\" (the \"Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules\") and the related \"2018 Tax (Amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance Draft\" have been gazetted.\n\n# October 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Monetary Authority of Macau signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly implement professional training and mutual recognition of qualifications under the Enhanced Competency Framework for Banking Professionals.\n\n# November 16\n\nThe original text is a list of legal documents that have been gazetted. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and mostly accurate. However, \"Banking Industry Ordinance\" is not a direct match for the original, which uses \"銀行業（修訂）條例\" — \"Banking (Amendment) Ordinance\" would be more precise. Also, \"Rules on Risk Exposure Limits for the Banking Industry\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of structure and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, \"Banking Industry (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules\" is slightly awkward and could be more natural as \"Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is overly wordy and includes unnecessary punctuation. For example, \"under the Banking Ordinance (Amendment) Ordinance (2018)\" is redundant and confusing. The use of \"Banking Ordinance (Amendment) Ordinance\" is incorrect — it should be \"Banking (Amendment) Ordinance.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is overly verbose and uses phrases like \"Notice of Gazette\" which is not standard. The structure is also awkward, and the use of \"Rules on Capital of Banking Industry\" is not idiomatic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is the most accurate and fluent. It uses the dictionary terms correctly and maintains a natural, legal tone. The structure is clear and concise, and the use of \"Banking Sector\" aligns well with the term \"銀行業\" (banking industry).\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is concise but has some grammatical issues. For example, \"effective dates\" should be \"effective date\" as the original refers to a single date. Also, the structure \"Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be concise, use the dictionary terms accurately, and maintain a natural legal tone. It should avoid redundancy and unnecessary punctuation. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, but it can be refined slightly for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe “2018 Banking (Amendment) Ordinance (Effective Date) (No. 2) Notice,” the “Banking Sector (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules,” the “2018 Banking Sector (Capital) (Amendment) Rules,” and the “2018 Banking Sector (Disclosure) (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules” have been gazetted.\n\n# December 14\n\nThe original sentence, 《吸收虧損能力規則》生效。, translates to a formal statement about the implementation of a rule or set of rules related to the capacity to absorb losses. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to apply them.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **\"The Rules on Loss-absorbing Capacity come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Rules on\" to denote the subject, and \"come into operation\" is a natural phrasing for \"生效\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Loss-absorbing Capacity\" is a compound noun that could be more concise.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n2. **\"The Loss-absorbing capacity Rules come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"come into operation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The placement of \"capacity\" after \"Loss-absorbing\" is awkward and less idiomatic.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct.\n3. **\"Rules on Loss-absorbing Capacity come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Similar to the first translation, but omits the article \"The\", which is acceptable in headlines or titles.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less formal than including \"The\".  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct.\n4. **\"The Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"come into operation\" and correctly applies the dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules\" is a bit awkward as a compound noun.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct.\n5. **\"Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and direct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitting \"The\" may be acceptable in certain contexts, but it feels less formal.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct.\n6. **\"Loss-absorbing Rules come into operation.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Very concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Loss-absorbing Rules\" omits \"capacity\" and \"loss\" from the original, which may misrepresent the meaning.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Incorrect, as it omits \"capacity\" and \"loss\".\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be both grammatically correct and semantically accurate. It should reflect the formal tone of the original and use the dictionary terms appropriately. Among the translations, the first one, **\"The Rules on Loss-absorbing Capacity come into operation,\"** is the most natural and accurate. It includes the article \"The\" for formality, uses \"Rules on\" to denote the subject, and correctly applies the dictionary terms. However, \"Loss-absorbing Capacity\" could be slightly refined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules come into operation.\n\n# December 19th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced regulatory measures (namely self-assessment, focused assessments, and dialogues on banking culture) to understand the progress of reforming Hong Kong's banking culture.\n\n# December 21\nThe original text is a simple date: \"12月21日\", which translates to \"December 21\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating the characters \"月\" (month), \"日\" (day), and the numbers \"12\" and \"21\". The most accurate and natural translation would be \"December 21\", as it directly corresponds to the given date without unnecessary additions like \"st\" or \"dates\".\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. The first, fourth, and fifth translations are correct and concise, using \"December 21\" or \"# December 21\", which is appropriate for a date format. However, the second and sixth translations use \"December 21st\", which is grammatically correct but less commonly used in formal or written contexts. The third translation, \"December 21 dates\", is incorrect as it adds an unnecessary word that changes the meaning of the original text.\nConsidering the dictionary options and the need for a natural and accurate translation, \"December 21\" is the most appropriate and concise translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nThe HKMA publishes the latest list of authorized institutions designated as Systemically Important.\n\n# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\n\n# January 23\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between the Monetary Authority and two Swiss entities to enhance financial cooperation in specific areas. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Memorandum of Understanding\" or \"MoU\" for \"備忘錄\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"renminbi\" is used appropriately for \"人民\" in the context of currency.\n- The phrase \"financial collaboration\" or \"financial cooperation\" is used consistently for \"合作.\"\n- The term \"infrastructure financing\" is correctly used for \"基建融資.\"\n- The term \"wealth management\" is accurately used for \"財富管理.\"\n- The term \"internationalisation\" is correctly used for \"國際化.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"both parties\" which is slightly less precise than \"the two sides\" or \"both regions.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"the two sides\" but adds \"another\" before \"Memorandum of Understanding,\" which is unnecessary and slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the ideal, but uses \"between the two sides\" and \"both regions,\" which is slightly repetitive.\n- **Translation 4** introduces \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" which is not in the original text and may be an assumption not supported by the source.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Financial Affairs\" instead of \"Department of Finance\" and \"locations\" instead of \"regions,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Financial Department\" instead of \"Department of Finance\" and \"places\" instead of \"regions,\" which is less formal and less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"Monetary Authority\" is used consistently without adding unnecessary details like \"Hong Kong.\"\n- Use \"the two sides\" or \"both regions\" consistently for \"兩.\"\n- Avoid redundancy, such as using \"another\" before \"Memorandum of Understanding.\"\n- Use \"regions\" instead of \"locations\" or \"places\" for a more formal tone.\n- Ensure that \"Department of Finance\" is used as per the dictionary, not \"Financial Affairs\" or \"Financial Department.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance to strengthen financial cooperation between the two sides in areas including the internationalisation of the renminbi, wealth management, infrastructure financing, and international financial affairs. The Monetary Authority also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to promote financial innovation in both regions.\n\n# January 31st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched an upgraded version of the \"Fintech Talent Cultivation Programme\" (FCAS 2.0), which is aimed at strengthening the nurturing of local fintech talent to cope with the rising demand from industries.\n\n# March 9\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a governmental or institutional agreement. The key terms to be translated include \"金融\" (financial), \"備忘錄\" (Memorandum of Understanding or MoU), \"監管\" (regulatory), and \"科技\" (technology or fintech). The dictionary provides multiple options for these terms, and the translations by junior translators vary in their use of these terms and in fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"financial technology\" and \"furthering collaboration.\" The term \"furthering\" is slightly vague and less direct than \"promote.\" The use of \"financial technology\" is correct but could be more concise with \"fintech.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"fintech\" and \"bilateral fintech collaboration.\" This is concise and accurate. \"Bilateral\" is a good choice to emphasize the two-party nature of the agreement.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"fintech\" and \"between the two parties.\" This is clear and accurate. The inclusion of \"HKMA\" and \"MoU\" adds clarity and formality.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Similar to the third, but omits \"HKMA\" and uses \"between the two parties.\" It is still clear and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"financial technology\" and \"supervisory\" with a lowercase \"s.\" This is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary's \"supervision\" or \"supervisory\" and the term \"supervisory\" should be capitalized if used as a proper noun or title.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"fintech\" and \"collaboration in fintech.\" This is clear and concise, though \"collaboration in fintech\" is slightly wordier than \"fintech collaboration.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. \"Fintech\" is more concise and commonly used than \"financial technology.\" \"Memorandum of Understanding\" or \"MoU\" should be used as per the dictionary. \"Promote\" is more direct than \"furthering\" or \"encourage.\" \"Bilateral\" or \"between the two parties\" effectively conveys the mutual nature of the agreement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding to promote fintech collaboration between the two parties.\n\n# March 27-28\n\nThe Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority jointly co-organised a two-day executive workshop for administrative officers with the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.\n\n# May 15\n\nIFFO與香港銀行公會合辦「建設可持續發展的一帶一路：香港的關鍵角色」研討會。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a formal announcement about an event co-organized by IFFO and the Hong Kong Association of Banks. The key elements are: the event name, the organizers, and the event's purpose.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"co-organised\" and accurately translates \"可持續\" as \"sustainable\" and \"關鍵角色\" as \"key role.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"seminar\" instead of \"symposium\" or \"conference,\" which may not match the formality of the original. Also, the event title is slightly simplified.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly co-organised\" and includes the full name of the association (HKAB), which adds clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Critical Role\" instead of \"Key Role,\" which is less aligned with the original term \"關鍵角色.\" Also, the event is labeled as a \"seminar\" rather than \"symposium\" or \"conference.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"symposium\" and includes \"Sustainable Development\" as a direct translation of \"建設可持續發展.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Sustainable Development of the Belt and Road\" is a bit awkward and not the most natural phrasing. Also, \"jointly co-organised with\" is redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly co-organised\" and \"seminar\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The event title is slightly simplified, and \"Key Role\" is less precise than \"Critical Role\" in some contexts, though both are acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Association of Banks\" and \"co-organised\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The event title is not fully translated, and the structure is awkward with \"the 'Building... seminar.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly co-organises\" and \"Critical Role.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The verb tense is present tense (\"co-organises\") instead of past tense, which is more appropriate for a completed event. Also, the structure is slightly awkward.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- The event should be referred to as a \"symposium\" or \"conference\" to match the formality of the original.\n- \"Jointly co-organised\" is the most accurate and natural phrasing for \"合辦.\"\n- \"Sustainable Belt and Road\" is more concise and natural than \"Sustainable Development of the Belt and Road.\"\n- \"Key Role\" is more aligned with the original term \"關鍵角色\" than \"Critical Role.\"\n- The full name of the association, \"Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB),\" should be included for clarity.\n- The event title should be enclosed in quotation marks and accurately reflect the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIFFO and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly co-organised the symposium \"Building a Sustainable Belt and Road: Hong Kong's Key Role.\"\n\n# May 29\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Investment Promotion Bureau jointly co-organised a seminar in Guangzhou with the theme \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area • New Opportunities in Overseas Treasury Management\".\n\n# June 14\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 6月14日\". The key elements are the month \"6月\" and the day \"14日\". According to the dictionary, \"月\" should be translated as \"June\" (since it is the sixth month), and \"日\" should be translated as \"day\" or \"Date\". The number \"14\" should be translated as \"14\" or \"fourteen\".\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **June 14th** – This is a natural and fluent translation. It uses the ordinal form \"14th\" which is appropriate in English for dates. However, it omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be important depending on context.\n2. **# June 14** – This translation preserves the \"#\" symbol and uses the correct month and day. However, it omits the \"th\" in \"14th\", which is less formal but still acceptable in some contexts.\n3. **June 14** – This is a concise and correct translation. It omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be acceptable if it's not crucial to the meaning.\n4. **June 14 day** – This is awkward and unidiomatic. In English, we do not say \"June 14 day\"; the correct form is \"June 14th\" or \"June 14\".\n5. **# June 14** – Same as translation 2. It is correct but lacks the ordinal \"th\".\n6. **June 14 day** – Same as translation 4. It is unidiomatic and incorrect.\nReasoning for the best possible translation:\n- The \"#\" symbol may be a heading or label, so it should be preserved.\n- The month \"6月\" should be translated as \"June\".\n- The day \"14日\" should be translated as \"14th\" to reflect the ordinal nature of the date in English.\n- The number \"14\" should be written as \"14\" rather than \"fourteen\" for consistency with date formatting.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is: **# June 14th**.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Capital Market Association jointly co-organised the \"2018 Green and Social Bond Principles\" Annual General Meeting and Conference in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 15\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Research Bureau of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) jointly co-organised the \"Seminar on Collaboration between Mainland China and Hong Kong on Green Finance\" in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 25th\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 6月25日\". The dictionary provides several options for translating the characters \"月\" (month), \"日\" (day), and the numbers \"6\", \"2\", and \"5\". The translations provided by the junior translators mostly capture the date correctly, but there are some inconsistencies and minor issues to consider.\nStrengths:\n- All translations correctly identify the month as \"June\" and the day as \"25\".\n- The use of \"June 25th\" is grammatically correct and commonly used in English for dates.\n- The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations (e.g., \"#June 25th\") is consistent with the original text, which may be used for formatting or emphasis.\nWeaknesses:\n- \"June 25 Day\" and \"June 25 day\" are less common and less natural in English. The correct ordinal form \"25th\" is preferred.\n- The use of \"day\" without the ordinal form is not standard in English date formats.\n- The dictionary provides \"day\" and \"Day\" as options for \"日\", but \"Day\" with a capital \"D\" is not typically used in this context unless it's part of a title or heading.\nImprovements:\n- Use the ordinal form \"25th\" for the day.\n- Maintain the \"#\" symbol if it is intended for formatting or emphasis, as in the original text.\n- Ensure consistency in capitalization and formatting.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be \"June 25th\" with the \"#\" symbol included if it is part of the original formatting.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Shenzhen Municipal Government's Financial Development Services Office have launched the inaugural \"Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme\" for Hong Kong university students.\n\n# June 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority signed a Co-operation Agreement to strengthen their fintech collaboration.\n\n# June 27\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission issued a joint consultation summary document on further improving the regulatory system for over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n# June 28\nThe original text is a simple date: \"6月28日\". The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), including specific months like \"June\" and \"July\" and general terms like \"month\" and \"day.\" The number \"28\" is straightforward, and \"6\" can be translated as \"6\" or \"six.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"June 28\"** – This is correct and concise. It uses the dictionary's \"June\" for \"6月\" and \"28\" for \"28日.\" It is the most natural and fluent translation.\n2. **\"# June 28\"** – The use of the hashtag is unnecessary and not part of the original text. It may be an attempt to format the date as a heading or label, but it is not appropriate in this context.\n3. **\"June 28 Day\"** – This is awkward and redundant. \"Day\" is not needed after the date, as \"June 28\" already implies a day.\n4. **\"June 28th\"** – While grammatically correct in some contexts, it is not standard in formal or written English when referring to dates. \"June 28\" is more commonly used and preferred in most contexts.\n5. **\"June 28\"** – Same as the first translation, which is correct and natural.\n6. **\"# June 28th\"** – Combines the unnecessary hashtag from translation 2 with the ordinal form from translation 4. This is both stylistically and grammatically inappropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and faithful to the original text. \"June 28\" is the most appropriate choice because it uses the correct month (\"June\" for \"6月\") and day (\"28\" for \"28日\") without unnecessary additions or stylistic errors. It is also the most commonly used format in English for writing dates in this context.\n\nIFFO chaired a panel discussion on \"Risk Mitigation in Infrastructure Investment and Financing\" during the 3rd Belt and Road Summit.\n\n# July 3\n\n\"Bond Connect\" celebrates its first anniversary.\n\n# July 18th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has released the \"Open Application Programming Interface\" (Open API) framework for the banking sector in Hong Kong.\n\n# August 7th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions, announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" programme.\n\n# August 15-16\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council jointly co-organised a senior roundtable meeting in Hong Kong titled \"Linking the Belt and Road, Jointly Expanding Development Opportunities\".\n\n# August 24th\n\n\"Bond Connect\" fully implements the real-time delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement model.\nThe original sentence is concise and technical, focusing on the implementation of a specific settlement model. The junior translators have made various attempts, but several issues are evident:\n1. **Translation of \"債券通\"**: All translators correctly used \"Bond Connect\" with quotation marks, which is appropriate.\n2. **\"全面實施\"**: The first and sixth translators used \"fully implemented\" and \"will fully implement,\" respectively. The former is more accurate as the sentence is in the present tense, indicating that the implementation is already complete.\n3. **\"即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式\"**: This phrase is the core of the sentence. The term \"貨銀兩訖\" refers to \"delivery versus payment\" (DvP), which is a standard financial term. The third, fourth, and fifth translators correctly used \"delivery versus payment (DvP).\" The first and second translators used \"clearing\" or \"securities clearing,\" which is less precise.\n4. **\"模式\"**: The correct translation is \"model\" or \"mode.\" The third, fourth, and fifth translators used \"model,\" which is more natural in this context.\n5. **Fluency and Grammar**: The third and fifth translations are the most fluent and grammatically correct. The first and second translations are awkward and lack clarity. The sixth translation is grammatically correct but uses the future tense, which may not align with the original sentence's present tense.\nBased on these observations, the best translation should use \"fully implements\" to reflect the present tense, \"delivery versus payment (DvP)\" for accuracy, and \"model\" for \"模式.\" The final translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English.\n\n# August 31\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has designated two retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (Chapter 584).\n\n# September 9\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding a cooperation agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Central Bank of Brazil, focusing on fintech collaboration. The dictionary provides specific translation options for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"Co-operation Agreement\" and \"fintech issues\" as per the dictionary. It correctly identifies the HKMA and the Brazilian Central Bank.\n2. **Translation 2** is also accurate, using \"Cooperation Agreement\" and \"fintech issues.\" It correctly names the HKMA and the Central Bank of Brazil.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"advance\" instead of \"promote\" for the verb \"進,\" which is a valid option but slightly less precise in this context. It also uses \"financial technology issues\" instead of \"fintech issues,\" which is acceptable but less concise.\n4. **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Administration\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error, as the HKMA is the correct name. It also uses \"banks\" instead of \"central banks,\" which is less precise.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and concise, using \"Cooperation Agreement\" and \"fintech issues.\" It correctly identifies the HKMA and the Central Bank of Brazil.\n6. **Translation 6** is nearly identical to Translation 2, with the only difference being the use of \"Co-operation Agreement\" instead of \"Cooperation Agreement.\" Both are acceptable, but \"Co-operation Agreement\" is more formal and aligns with the dictionary's \"Co-operation Agreement\" option.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the most formal and precise terms, align with the dictionary, and maintain clarity and fluency. \"Co-operation Agreement\" is more formal and matches the dictionary's preferred term. \"Fintech issues\" is more concise and aligns with the dictionary's \"fintech\" option. The correct name for the HKMA should be used, and \"central banks\" should be used instead of \"banks\" to maintain precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Central Bank of Brazil signed a Co-operation Agreement to promote collaboration between the two central banks on fintech issues.\n\n# September 17\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS,\" which commenced full operation on September 30.\n\n# September 20th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBoC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the issuance of People's Bank of China bills using the Central Settlement System for debt instruments.\n\n# September 21\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**由金管局與財資市場公會合辦的「2018財資市場高峰會」在香港舉行。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Treasury Market Summit\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Treasury Market Association\" is not a standard term; the dictionary lists \"Association of Banks\" for \"公會.\" Also, the structure \"Organized by... the '2018... Summit' was held in Hong Kong\" is awkward and lacks clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly organised\" and \"Association of Banks\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"held in Hong Kong\" is awkwardly placed at the end. Also, \"Treasury Market Summit\" is correct, but \"Market\" should be plural as per the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"co-hosted\" and includes the full name \"Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB)\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Treasury Market Summit\" should be \"Treasury Markets Summit\" as \"市場\" is plural in the original. Also, the structure is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly organised\" and \"Association of Banks\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the second translation: \"held in Hong Kong\" is awkwardly placed. Also, \"Treasury Market Summit\" should be plural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly co-organised\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The sentence structure is incorrect: \"By... jointly co-organised... in Hong Kong\" is ungrammatical and awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"jointly co-organised\" and \"Association of Banks\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Treasury Markets Summit\" is correct, but the phrase \"was held in Hong Kong\" is awkwardly placed at the end.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The phrase **「2018財資市場高峰會」** should be translated as **\"2018 Treasury Markets Summit\"** (plural \"Markets\" for \"市場\").\n- **「公會」** should be translated as **\"Association of Banks\"** (as per the dictionary).\n- **「合辦」** should be translated as **\"jointly co-organised\"** or **\"co-hosted\"** (both are acceptable, but \"co-hosted\" is more natural in this context).\n- The structure should be **\"The [event]... was held in Hong Kong\"** for clarity and fluency.\n### Final Translation:\nThe \"2018 Treasury Markets Summit\", co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Association of Banks, was held in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 25-26\n\nIFFO hosts the 2nd \"Investors and Debt Financing Roundtable,\" and also announced the addition of 5 new institutions as partners, bringing the total number to 95.\n\n# October 31st\n\nThe original text announces the formal launch of \"eTradeConnect,\" a blockchain-based trade financing platform developed by an alliance of 12 major Hong Kong banks. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, though with varying degrees of fluency and accuracy.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"eTradeConnect\" correctly. It uses \"developed jointly by an alliance of 12 major Hong Kong banks,\" which is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is more formal and appropriate in official contexts. The phrase \"developed jointly by 12 major banks in Hong Kong\" is slightly less precise than \"an alliance of 12 major Hong Kong banks,\" but still acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"trade finance platform\" instead of \"trade financing platform,\" which is a minor variation but still correct. The phrase \"built on blockchain\" is slightly less formal than \"based on blockchain technology,\" but still acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"a consortium of 12 major banks in Hong Kong,\" which is more precise than \"an alliance of 12 major Hong Kong banks.\" The structure is fluent and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate but has some awkward phrasing, such as \"formed on a blockchain basis,\" which is less natural than \"based on blockchain technology.\" The use of \"a total of 12 major banks\" is correct but slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the weakest. It has grammatical errors, such as \"announce... formally launch\" and \"composed of a total of twelve principal banks’ development by Hong Kong,\" which is confusing and ungrammatical.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the most natural phrasing while adhering to the dictionary terms. It should also use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for formality and clarity, and use \"eTradeConnect\" as specified. The phrase \"developed jointly by a consortium of 12 major banks in Hong Kong\" is more precise than \"an alliance of 12 major Hong Kong banks.\" The phrase \"based on blockchain technology\" is more natural than \"built on blockchain\" or \"formed on a blockchain basis.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the formal launch of \"eTradeConnect.\" This is a trade financing platform based on blockchain technology, jointly developed by a consortium of 12 major banks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the operators of the \"eTradeConnect\" and European we.trade platforms to initiate a new proof-of-concept connecting the two platforms.\n\n# October 31 to November 15\nThe original text is a simple date range: \"10月31日至11月15日,\" which translates to \"From October 31 to November 15.\" The dictionary provides specific translations for \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), and numerical values for the dates. The junior translators mostly captured the correct date range, but there were a few issues:\n- The first, second, and third translations included the \"#\" symbol, which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary in this context.\n- The sixth translation incorrectly used \"October 10\" instead of \"October 31.\"\n- The fifth translation used \"October 31st to November 15th,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more verbose than necessary for a simple date range.\nThe best approach is to use the most concise and natural phrasing while ensuring that the dates are correctly translated and that no unnecessary symbols are included. The phrase \"October 31 to November 15\" is the most natural and accurate translation of the original text.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides field visit arrangements for the mutual assessment conducted jointly by the Financial Action Task Force and the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering on Hong Kong.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and \"Financial Secretary\" for \"財政司司長.\"\n- Most translations use \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" for \"外匯基金條例\" and \"Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance\" for \"存款保障計劃條例.\"\n- The term \"Stored Value Instruments\" or \"Stored Value Payment Tools\" is appropriately used for \"儲值支付工具.\"\n- The date \"June 25, 2003\" is consistently translated, and the reference to the HKMA website is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" but incorrectly uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員\" in the phrase \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" (which is repeated multiple times in the dictionary, but the correct term is \"Monetary Authority\").\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Facility\" for \"工具\" in \"Stored Value Facility,\" which is not the best fit; \"Instruments\" or \"Tools\" would be more appropriate.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"2003 June 25\" instead of the standard \"June 25, 2003,\" and \"listed\" instead of \"set out\" or \"disclosed.\"\n- **Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, but it separates the disclosure of the delegation into a separate sentence, which slightly disrupts the flow.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"explicitly stipulated\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and \"disclose\" instead of \"disclosed\" in the second part of the sentence.\n- **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"disclosed\" correctly and maintaining a clear structure.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"專員\" is consistently translated as \"Monetary Authority\" (as per the dictionary).\n- Use \"Stored Value Instruments\" or \"Stored Value Payment Tools\" for \"儲值支付工具.\"\n- Maintain the standard date format: \"June 25, 2003.\"\n- Use \"set out\" or \"disclosed\" consistently for \"載\" and \"披露.\"\n- Ensure that \"轉授\" is translated as \"delegated\" or \"delegation\" depending on context.\n- Use \"public document\" and \"can be accessed\" for \"公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱.\"\n**Best Translation:**\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, set out the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs, and also disclosed that the Financial Secretary delegated certain powers to the Monetary Authority. The relevant letter is a public document and can be accessed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund must primarily be used to affect the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing the functions conferred upon him by that Ordinance, as well as other functions assigned by the Financial Secretary under other Ordinances. The Office of the Monetary Authority is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Monetary Authority is the Governor of the HKMA.\n\nThe Monetary Authority, empowered by the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking operations and deposit-taking operations. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) Ordinance designates the Monetary Authority as the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority a series of powers to conduct an orderly resolution of the relevant entities, thereby mitigating the risks posed by the unsustainable operations of those entities to the stability and effective operations of Hong Kong’s financial system.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal text that outlines the legal authority granted to the Monetary Authority under two specific ordinances. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but \"bank securities\" is awkward and unclear. \"Mandatory provident fund schemes business\" is also awkwardly phrased.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"banks’ securities\" which is grammatically correct but may not be the intended meaning. \"Mandatory provident fund business\" is vague and lacks specificity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund operations\" which is more natural and accurate. However, \"empower the Monetary Authority with certain powers\" is redundant and could be simplified.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, using \"banking, securities and mandatory provident fund business\" which is natural and precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Similar to the third, but \"banking securities\" is incorrect and should be \"banking and securities.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"banks’ securities\" again, which is grammatically correct but may not be the intended meaning. \"Mandatory provident fund operations\" is accurate but could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"banking and securities\" rather than \"banks’ securities\" to avoid ambiguity. \"Mandatory provident fund business\" is acceptable but \"operations\" may be more precise in a legal context. The verb \"grant\" is more direct than \"empower with certain powers.\" The use of \"relating to\" is more natural than \"related to.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Monetary Authority certain powers relating to banking and securities and mandatory provident fund operations.\n\nThe original sentence is a legal statement, and as such, clarity, precision, and adherence to the dictionary are essential. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and use of the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"Insurance Ordinance\" as the legal document, using \"Ordinance\" from the dictionary.\n- The term \"Monetary Authority\" is consistently used for \"專員\" and \"金融管理,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"power\" is correctly used for \"權力.\"\n- The phrase \"insurance business of banks\" is accurately rendered, using \"insurance business\" for \"保險業務\" and \"banks\" for \"銀行.\"\n- The use of \"delegation\" or \"delegated\" for \"轉授\" is appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and second translations use \"inspection and investigation\" or \"investigate and inspect,\" which are slightly redundant and not in the same order as the original.\n- The third and fourth translations use \"investigate and examine,\" which is repetitive and not ideal.\n- The fifth translation uses \"investigative and investigative power,\" which is redundant and grammatically awkward.\n- The sixth translation uses \"HKMA\" for \"金融管理專員,\" which is a direct match from the dictionary, but the structure \"may be delegated the power\" is less natural than \"the power may be delegated.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"investigate and inspect\" in the correct order as in the original.\n- Ensure that \"delegation\" is used in a natural grammatical structure, such as \"the power may be delegated.\"\n- Avoid redundancy in terms like \"investigate and examine.\"\n- Use \"Monetary Authority\" consistently, as it is the most formal and appropriate term in a legal context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Insurance Ordinance provides that the power to investigate and inspect the insurance business of banks may be delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks in their compliance with the requirements of the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority the responsibility to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger the disbursement of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of banks unable to meet their liabilities.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in terms of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the role of the \"Monetary Authority\" (or \"Financial Management Commissioner\") and the statutory framework of the \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\"\n- Most translations accurately use the term \"clearing and settlement systems\" for \"結算及交收系統.\"\n- The phrase \"stored value payment facilities\/tools\/instruments\" is consistently used, aligning with the dictionary's \"Stored Value\" and \"tools\/instruments.\"\n- The use of \"safety and efficiency\" for \"安全及效率\" is consistent across translations.\n- The structure of the sentence regarding the Ordinance authorizing the Monetary Authority to manage licensing systems is well-represented.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Use of \"Financial Management Commissioner\"**: The dictionary lists \"Monetary Authority\" as the correct translation for \"專員\" in this context, not \"Financial Management Commissioner.\" This is a critical error in translations 3 and 6.\n- **\"Stability\" vs. \"soundness\"**: While \"stability\" is acceptable, \"soundness\" might be more appropriate for \"穩定\" in the context of financial systems.\n- **\"Functioning as\" vs. \"function as\"**: \"Functioning as\" is more natural in English than \"function as\" in this context.\n- **\"Licensing systems\" vs. \"licensing regime\"**: \"Regime\" is more appropriate than \"systems\" for \"制度\" in the context of regulatory frameworks.\n- **\"Retail payment systems\"**: This is correctly used, but \"retail payment systems\" should be consistent with the dictionary's \"retail\" and \"system.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"clearing and settlement systems\" for \"結算及交收系統.\"\n- Use \"stored value payment facilities\" for \"儲值支付工具.\"\n- Use \"stability\" or \"soundness\" for \"穩定.\"\n- Use \"licensing regime\" for \"發牌制度.\"\n- Use \"functioning as\" for \"作為.\"\n- Ensure consistent and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Facilities Ordinance, the Monetary Authority may designate and monitor clearing and settlement systems that are essential to Hong Kong's currency or financial stability or to Hong Kong's functioning as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for stored value payment facilities, and to designate retail payment systems and monitor the operation of such systems to ensure their safety and efficiency.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: Contains grammatical errors (\"may employs\") and uses \"Monetary Authority\" inconsistently. It also misuses \"the scope of power\" instead of \"statutory powers\" and fails to use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n2. **Second Translation**: Uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly applies \"statutory powers.\" However, it uses \"civil servants\" instead of \"public officers\" as per the dictionary, which is a deviation. Also, \"granted or delegated to the Monetary Authority\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third Translation**: Correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"public officers.\" It also uses \"statutory powers\" and \"delegated to the Monetary Authority.\" However, \"personnel\" is used instead of \"talent\" as per the dictionary, which is a minor deviation.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: Uses \"HKMA\" and \"public officers\" correctly. It uses \"Chairman\" instead of \"Chief Executive,\" which is a misrepresentation of the role. Also, \"conferred or delegated\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Chief Executive\" correctly. It uses \"expertise\" and \"high degree of autonomy\" as per the dictionary. However, it omits \"HKMA\" in the last sentence, which is inconsistent.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: Uses \"HKMA\" and \"public officers\" correctly. However, it uses \"civil servants\" instead of \"public officers\" and \"scope of statutory power\" instead of \"statutory powers.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"public officers\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"statutory powers\" and \"delegated.\"\n- Use \"Chief Executive\" for the role.\n- Use \"talent\" or \"personnel\" as per the dictionary.\n- Maintain grammatical correctness and fluency.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fifth and third translations, ensuring consistency, correct terminology, and natural English flow.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the framework of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, but may employ staff under terms and conditions different from those applicable to public officers, in order to attract talent with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The day-to-day operations of the HKMA enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"Currency Board\" for \"發行局\" and \"approximately\" for \"約.\" The structure is clear and natural. However, it uses \"keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar,\" which is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars against 1 US dollar.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"maintaining monetary stability by keeping the exchange rate...\" which is a natural structure. However, it uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員,\" which is not the best match. The dictionary lists \"Monetary Authority\" as an option for \"金融管理,\" but \"專員\" should be translated as \"Officer\" or \"Official,\" not \"Monetary Authority.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"Currency Board\" and \"approximately\" correctly. It also uses \"execution methods\" for \"方式,\" which is acceptable but \"methods of implementation\" is more natural. It also uses \"integrity\" for \"健全,\" which is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is slightly less fluent. It uses \"currency policy objectives\" instead of \"monetary policy objectives,\" which is less standard. It also uses \"currency systems\" instead of \"monetary system,\" which is not ideal. The phrase \"it was specified that monetary stability should be maintained through the Currency Board system\" is slightly passive and less direct than the active voice used in other translations.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is very similar to the fourth, with the same issues regarding \"currency policy\" and \"currency systems.\" It also uses \"it was stated\" instead of \"the Financial Secretary stated,\" which is less direct and slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is very close to the first and is accurate. It uses \"monetary policy objectives\" and \"monetary system\" correctly. It also uses \"methods of implementation\" for \"方式,\" which is natural. However, it uses \"keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar,\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use active voice, correct terminology, and natural phrasing. It should use \"monetary policy objectives\" and \"monetary system\" rather than \"currency policy\" or \"currency systems.\" It should use \"Currency Board\" for \"發行局,\" \"approximately\" for \"約,\" and \"integrity\" for \"健全.\" It should also use \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員\" and avoid passive constructions like \"it was stated.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that the Currency Board system should be used to maintain monetary stability, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars against 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including deciding on related strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of terminology consistency, grammatical precision, and stylistic clarity. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This version is well-structured and fluent. It correctly uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary. However, it incorrectly uses \"Financial Secretary for Financial Affairs and Treasury\" instead of \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury,\" which is more accurate based on the dictionary. Also, \"preserving Hong Kong's status\" is slightly less precise than \"maintaining Hong Kong's standing.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" correctly and includes \"issuance\" instead of \"issue\" in the third bullet point, which is more formal and appropriate. However, \"being responsible for operating such systems\" is slightly wordy compared to \"taking responsibility for operating such systems.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" correctly and \"statutory currency\" is a minor deviation from \"statutory notes and coins,\" which is more precise. The phrase \"under appropriate circumstances\" is slightly less direct than \"where appropriate.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is accurate and well-written. It uses \"Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau,\" which is not the exact match in the dictionary, but \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" is more standard. It also uses \"taking responsibility for operating these systems when appropriate,\" which is clear and precise.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This version has some inconsistencies. It uses \"Director of the Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"financial sector\" instead of \"financial system\" in the first sentence, which is a minor but notable deviation. The phrase \"legal tender notes and coins\" is slightly more specific than \"statutory notes and coins,\" which is acceptable but not the exact match.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is very strong. It uses \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" correctly and \"taking responsibility for the operation of relevant systems where appropriate\" is precise and natural. It also uses \"foster confidence\" instead of \"enhance confidence,\" which is a slight stylistic choice but still accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the exact terms from the dictionary, maintain grammatical precision, and ensure clarity and fluency. Based on the above review, the sixth translation is the closest to the ideal, with only minor adjustments needed for consistency with the dictionary and stylistic refinement.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and for pursuing policies to preserve Hong Kong’s international financial centre status. To implement these policies, the duties of the Monetary Authority include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of statutory notes and coins\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems, and taking responsibility for the operation of relevant systems where appropriate\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organisations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and to pursue appropriate market development initiatives to assist in strengthening the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe original text outlines the control and management responsibilities of the Exchange Fund by the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"Financial Secretary\" for \"財政司司長\" and \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員.\"\n- The term \"Exchange Fund\" is appropriately used for \"外匯基金\" in most translations.\n- The phrase \"delegated powers\" or \"power delegated\" is used consistently for \"轉授的權力.\"\n- The structure \"responsible to the Financial Secretary\" is accurate for \"向財政司司長負責.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"must\" unnecessarily, which can make the tone overly prescriptive.\n- The phrase \"operation and investment management\" in Translation 2 is slightly awkward compared to \"management and investment.\"\n- \"Based on the power delegated\" is more natural than \"in accordance with the delegated powers from.\"\n- \"To the Financial Secretary\" in Translation 6 is less idiomatic than \"to the Financial Secretary.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"responsible to the Financial Secretary\" consistently.\n- Use \"management and investment\" rather than \"operation and investment management.\"\n- Use \"based on the power delegated\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Avoid unnecessary modal verbs like \"must\" unless required by context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, based on the power delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe original sentence discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) approach to daily operations and implementing government policy objectives, emphasizing its autonomy, accountability, and transparency. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"supported by\" which is slightly awkward in this context. Also, \"Government\" should be capitalized if referring to the official entity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is fluent and accurate, using \"methods used\" and \"while being supported by.\" However, \"HKMA\" should be spelled out as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is a strong translation, using \"approaches adopted\" and \"while simultaneously ensuring.\" It is fluent and adheres well to the dictionary terms. However, \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" is incorrect; it should be \"HKMA.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of \"to implement Government policies objectives\" has a minor grammatical issue (\"policies objectives\" should be \"policy objectives\"). Also, \"supplemented by\" is slightly less natural than \"complemented by.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of the \"HKMA.\" It also uses \"strong degree of autonomy,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"high degree.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"methods adopted\" and \"complemented by,\" which are natural and precise. It also correctly uses \"HKMA\" and adheres to the dictionary terms.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" correctly, spelling it out on first mention.\n- Use \"approaches\" or \"methods\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"high degree of autonomy\" as per the dictionary.\n- Correctly use \"Government\" with a capital \"G\" when referring to the official entity.\n- Use \"complemented by\" or \"supported by\" for the relationship between autonomy and accountability\/transparency.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in the approaches adopted for daily operations and the implementation of government policy objectives, complemented by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the currency and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring resilient and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) need to gain public confidence in order to effectively perform its duties. It emphasizes the HKMA's responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public and to address issues of public concern that fall within its responsibilities.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"rigorous approach\" for \"嚴謹的態度\" and \"issues of significant public concern\" for \"備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項.\" However, \"HKMA\" is used without full expansion, which may be acceptable in context but could be clarified for clarity.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** The use of \"serious attitude\" for \"嚴謹的態度\" is less precise than \"rigorous.\" Also, \"widely concerned about\" is awkwardly phrased. The translation is otherwise clear and accurate.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"rigorous attitude\" for \"嚴謹的態度\" and \"fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities\" for \"涉及金管局職責範圍的事項.\" The structure is natural and the terminology is precise.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** The use of \"jobs\" for \"工作\" is incorrect. \"Jobs\" implies employment, whereas \"work\" or \"tasks\" is more appropriate. The translation is otherwise clear.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** The use of \"Bank\" for \"金管局\" is incorrect. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, \"the general public\" is a bit redundant when \"the public\" is already used.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation is very close to the third one. It uses \"serious attitude\" instead of \"rigorous attitude,\" which is slightly less precise. However, the rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"rigorous attitude\" for \"嚴謹的態度\" and \"issues of public concern that fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities\" for \"備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項.\" It should also use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and accuracy. The structure should be natural and fluent, avoiding awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn order to effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must gain the confidence of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous attitude in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"HKMA\" as the Monetary Authority and use \"Financial Secretary\" for \"財政司司長.\"\n- Most translations use \"Legislative Council\" for \"立法會,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"responsible to the public\" is consistently used, aligning with the dictionary's \"responsible for.\"\n- The phrase \"enhance transparency and maintain an open policy\" is well-received and accurately reflects the original intent.\n- The structure of the two objectives is preserved in all translations, with minor variations in wording.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Commissioner\" for \"專員,\" which is not accurate. The correct term from the dictionary is \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- The term \"Legislative\" is used in some translations without specifying \"Council,\" which is less precise than \"Legislative Council.\"\n- The phrase \"social pulse\" is used in some translations, but \"public sentiment\" or \"societal trends\" may be more natural in English.\n- Some translations use \"public opinion\" or \"public feedback\" for \"意見,\" which is acceptable but \"public opinion\" is more aligned with the formal tone of the original text.\n- The term \"statutory restrictions\" is used correctly, but the placement of this phrase in the objectives can be improved for clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that \"專員\" is translated as \"Monetary Authority\" and not \"Commissioner.\"\n- Use \"Legislative Council\" consistently for \"立法會.\"\n- Use \"public opinion\" or \"public sentiment\" for \"意見.\"\n- Ensure that the phrase \"take full account of\" is used for \"顧及.\"\n- Improve the flow of the objectives by placing \"statutory restrictions\" at the beginning of the sentence for clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the HKMA is responsible to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the authority of the HKMA is established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also responsible to the public through the Legislative Council. Furthermore, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibilities, namely to promote public understanding of the HKMA’s role and objectives, and to closely monitor issues of concern to the public. When carrying out its daily work and maintaining broad contact with society, the HKMA remains committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure, while taking full account of statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and confidential information, that the financial sector and the public fully understand the HKMA’s work;\n- To ensure that the HKMA understands public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. It correctly uses \"bilingual periodicals and focused publications\" and \"enhance public financial literacy.\" However, \"periodicals\" may not be the best term for \"期刊\" in this context, as \"publications\" or \"journals\" might be more appropriate.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"reaching the highest international standards\" and \"mass media,\" which are acceptable. However, \"broad communication\" is less precise than \"extensive communication.\" The use of \"digital era\" is slightly outdated compared to \"digital age.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is well-structured and uses \"specialized publications\" and \"enhance citizens' financial knowledge.\" However, \"citizens\" is less precise than \"public\" or \"the public\" in this context.\n4. **Translation 4** is very close to the ideal version, with natural phrasing and accurate use of terms. It uses \"specialized publications\" and \"enhance the public's financial knowledge.\" However, \"Functions of the Institution\" is slightly wordy compared to \"Institutional Functions.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses \"special publications\" and \"media liaison work.\" However, \"functions\" is used instead of \"work,\" which may not be the best fit for \"工作.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is very strong, using \"special-topic publications\" and \"media relations.\" It also uses \"enhance the public's financial knowledge\" and \"Functions of the Institution,\" which is slightly wordy but still acceptable.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it also publishes various bilingual journals and special-topic publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) has a dedicated section that sets out economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA uses social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office has an information centre, which is divided into two parts: a library and an exhibition area, and is open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, through seminars and guided tours of the information centre, to explain the HKMA's functions to the public, especially students, and to enhance the public's financial knowledge. For detailed information on the HKMA's media relations, publications, and public education activities, see the \"Institutional Functions\" chapter.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased the frequency of publishing information on the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board's accounts, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund's \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" programme for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Issuing Committee, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has also included banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"briefing\" and \"scrutiny.\" It correctly uses \"three times a year\" and \"draft ordinances.\" However, it uses \"HKMA Governor\" consistently, which is appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"scrutinizing draft legislation\" and \"three times a year\" correctly. However, it uses \"Bills Committee\" instead of \"Bill Committees\" as in the original, which is slightly inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Committee\" entry.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has some issues. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Chief Executive\" instead of \"Governor,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"members\" instead of \"representatives\" for \"代表,\" which is not ideal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"three times a year\" and \"draft ordinances\" correctly. It also uses \"specific issues\" instead of \"special matters,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary's \"especially\" or \"particularly\" for \"特別.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is concise but has some inaccuracies. It uses \"Legislative\" instead of \"Legislative Council\" and \"Ordinances\" with a capital \"O,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's \"ordinance\" entry. It also uses \"3 times a year\" instead of \"three times a year,\" which is less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most accurate and consistent with the dictionary. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Governor\" correctly, and \"draft ordinances\" and \"three times a year\" are well placed. It also uses \"members\" for \"員\" in \"assist members in scrutinizing draft ordinances,\" which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Use \"Governor\" for \"總裁.\"\n- Use \"three times a year\" for \"每年3次.\"\n- Use \"briefing\" for \"簡報.\"\n- Use \"various\" for \"各項.\"\n- Use \"transparency\" for \"透明度.\"\n- Use \"enhancing\" for \"提高.\"\n- Use \"inquiries\" for \"查詢.\"\n- Use \"Committee\" for \"委員會.\"\n- Use \"assist\" for \"協助.\"\n- Use \"scrutinizing\" for \"審閱.\"\n- Use \"explain and discuss\" for \"闡釋及商討.\"\n- Use \"special issues\" or \"particularly important issues\" for \"特別事項.\"\n- Use \"draft ordinances\" for \"條例草案.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee three times a year on the HKMA's various work and policies, and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will also attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee and Bills Committee from time to time to explain and discuss special issues, as well as assist members in scrutinizing draft ordinances.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" The structure is clear, and the meaning is well-conveyed. However, it uses \"significant benefits\" which is slightly vague compared to \"greatly benefits\" or \"benefit.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"take into account the advice\" which is a good alternative to \"consult.\" However, it uses \"Monetary Authority\" for \"金融管理專員,\" which may not be the most precise term. Also, \"economic\" is used as a noun, which is grammatically incorrect.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation has several grammatical errors, such as \"exercise\" instead of \"exercises,\" and \"he must seek advice\" which is overly informal. It also uses \"disclose\" instead of \"stipulates,\" which is incorrect. The structure is less fluent and the translation is less professional.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"in their individual capacities,\" which is a precise translation of \"以個人身分.\" It also uses \"commerce\" instead of \"business,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable. The use of \"greatly benefits\" is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is very similar to the fourth, with the same strengths. It uses \"economy\" as a noun, which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"commerce\" instead of \"business,\" which is a minor variation.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"serves as the ex-officio chairman\" which is a good alternative to \"is the ex-officio Chairman.\" It also uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" for \"金融管理專員,\" which is more precise than \"Monetary Authority.\" The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above review, the sixth translation is the most accurate and fluent, with the correct use of terms and a formal tone. It also correctly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" for \"金融管理專員,\" which is more precise than \"Monetary Authority.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund and consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex-officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Financial Management Commissioner) are appointed by the Financial Secretary with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed due to their professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The professional expertise and experience of the members cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"house committees\" for \"專責委員會\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" for \"外匯基金諮詢委員會.\" However, \"house committees\" is not a standard term in this context; \"specialist committees\" or \"sub-committees\" would be more appropriate. The use of \"having been discussed in advance\" is slightly awkward but acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"specialist Committees\" and \"set up,\" which are accurate. However, \"to house oversight\" is an odd phrasing and not idiomatic. The phrase \"discussion all issues\" is grammatically incorrect and should be \"discussing all issues.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is clear and accurate. It uses \"specialized committees\" and \"set up,\" which are appropriate. However, \"the work of specific areas\" is slightly awkward; \"specific areas of work\" is more natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"sub-committees\" and \"oversee specific areas of work,\" which are accurate. The structure is fluent and the use of \"having been discussed in advance\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"sub-committees\" and \"each responsible for overseeing specific areas,\" which is a natural and clear phrasing. The use of \"making reports and recommendations\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"houses five specialized Committees,\" which is not idiomatic. \"Houses\" is not a standard term for establishing committees. The phrase \"monitoring the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s various areas of work\" is slightly awkward but acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"專責委員會\" should be translated as \"specialist committees\" or \"sub-committees,\" not \"house committees.\"\n- \"設\" should be translated as \"set up\" or \"established,\" not \"houses.\"\n- \"報告\" should be translated as \"report\" or \"make reports,\" not \"Internal briefing.\"\n- \"提出建議\" should be translated as \"make recommendations\" or \"propose recommendations.\"\n- \"監察\" should be translated as \"oversee\" or \"monitor,\" not \"monitoring.\"\n- \"事項\" should be translated as \"issues\" or \"matters,\" not left blank.\n- \"次會議\" should be translated as \"meetings,\" not \"times.\"\n- \"先進\" is not present in the original text and should be omitted.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set up five specialist committees to oversee specific areas of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, and these committees report to the Financial Secretary and make recommendations through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been discussed in advance by the relevant specialist committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and makes recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters relating to the HKMA's remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budget, and administrative and governance affairs. The Committee held a total of five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA's expenditure budget, performance assessment, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning matters. The Committee also reviewed the regularly submitted work reports by the HKMA.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's financial reporting procedures and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, as well as submits reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's financial statements, the components and accounting principles used in preparing these statements, and collaborating with external and internal auditors to review their audit scope and results. Members of the Audit Committee do not have any administrative functions within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The Committee held two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit (IA) Division.\n\nThe Currency Issuing Committee monitors the operation of the Currency Board system and reports on the situation of this pillar of Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Currency Board system operates in accordance with established policies, making recommendations for improving the system, and ensuring that the system's operations maintain high transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the meeting records of the Currency Issuing Committee and submits reports on the operation of the Currency Board system to the Committee. The Committee held a total of four meetings in 2018.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1

貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2

勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4

物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

With global economic growth softening, Hong Kong's economic growth is also expected to slow in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Physical Economic Activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong's economy continued to expand, but the year-on-year growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in local demand growth and the continued drag from net exports (Chart 1). Locally, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter, but its growth momentum weakened afterward, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth impairment effects from local asset price adjustments. Due to fragile business confidence, the growth rate of overall investment spending also slowed. Externally, goods exports remained broadly stable in the first three quarters, but significantly deteriorated in the fourth quarter as US-China trade tensions intensified. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker demand driven by exports. In contrast, service exports recorded faster full-year growth, partly benefiting from the robust performance of inbound tourism, while service imports maintained growth momentum largely due to growth in transport, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarter-on-quarter change in the seasonally adjusted total of local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\nChart 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local GDP  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a title and source citation for a chart, and the goal is to translate it accurately and fluently into English. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and these must be used exactly as specified.\n**Translation 1** is concise and uses \"GDP\" (which is a standard term for \"total value of production\"), and \"Government Statistics Department\" is a direct match for the dictionary entry for \"政府部.\" However, it omits the word \"total value\" and instead uses \"GDP,\" which is acceptable but not explicitly stated in the original.\n**Translation 2** uses \"Domestic Production Total Value,\" which is a literal translation of \"本地生產總值\" but is not standard English. \"GDP\" is the correct and widely accepted term for \"total value of production.\" Also, \"Census and Statistics Department\" is not a match for the dictionary entry for \"政府統計處.\"\n**Translation 3** is more descriptive but adds \"shows\" and \"various sectors,\" which are not in the original. It also uses \"local production total value,\" which is not standard English.\n**Translation 4** correctly uses \"GDP\" and \"Domestic,\" but \"Domestic Real Gross Domestic Product\" is redundant and awkward. It should be \"Real Domestic GDP\" or \"Real Local GDP.\"\n**Translation 5** is similar to Translation 3, adding unnecessary words like \"various factors\" and \"the Government statistics department\" (with incorrect capitalization and spacing).\n**Translation 6** is the most accurate and concise, using \"Real Local GDP\" and \"Government Statistics Department,\" both of which match the dictionary entries. It is the closest to the original in terms of structure and terminology.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Real Local GDP\" as it is the most accurate and standard translation of \"實質本地生產總值.\"\n- Use \"Government Statistics Department\" as it is the correct match for \"政府統計處.\"\n- Avoid adding unnecessary words like \"shows\" or \"various.\"\n- Ensure proper capitalization and formatting of the source.\n**Final Translation:**\nChart 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local GDP  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency Conditions\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of financial terminology. It correctly uses \"carry trade\" and \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" as per the dictionary. However, \"most favorable lending rates\" is slightly less standard than \"prime lending rates.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" as specified in the dictionary and includes \"HIBORs\" for \"同業拆息.\" The phrase \"most favorable loan rate\" is slightly awkward compared to \"prime lending rate.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"HKD\/USD\" appropriately. However, \"as stipulated by\" is slightly less formal than \"in accordance with\" or \"as per.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"HIBORs\" correctly and includes \"best loan rate\" which is acceptable, though \"prime lending rate\" is more standard.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is problematic. It contains many untransliterated terms and phrases in Chinese, such as \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" and \"banks purchase Hong Kong dollar and sell US dollar,\" which are not properly translated. It also uses \"design\" and \"bank interbank liquidity decrease\" in a non-fluent manner.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"prime lending rates\" and \"HIBORs\" correctly. It also uses \"coupled with\" and \"owing to\" effectively, enhancing readability.\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best translation should be fluent, use standard financial terminology, and strictly adhere to the dictionary. It should use \"prime lending rates\" instead of \"best loan rate\" and ensure that all terms from the dictionary are translated using the most appropriate English alternatives. It should also avoid awkward phrasing and ensure that the flow of the text is natural and professional.\n**Improved Translation**:\nMainly affected by carry trade activities under the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar broadly softened in 2018. In particular, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at a level of HK$7.85 to 1 US dollar, in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). As designed under the LERS, the monetary base of the Hong Kong dollar consequently contracted, indicating a decrease in interbank liquidity. Coupled with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, this led to an overall increase in Hong Kong dollar Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs). Due to rising funding costs in the banking sector, banks adjusted their prime lending rates upwards by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September, following the adjustment to the target range for the US Federal Funds rate. Regarding credit growth, the overall increase in bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly owing to slower local economic growth and weaker trading performance.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures rose slightly in 2018. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the core inflation rate increased from 1.7%, a low level in 2017, to 2.6% in 2018, although it remained at a moderate level. The faster increase in the housing rental component reflected the impact of earlier rises in private residential rents (Chart 2). More comprehensive analysis showed that nominal labor costs and commercial property rents grew slightly faster, making local cost pressures more pronounced. With inflation rising in some of Hong Kong's major import source countries, import price inflation also rose accordingly.\n\nChart 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\nThe original text is a caption for a chart, which should be concise and clear. The junior translators have mostly captured the essential meaning, but there are variations in punctuation, capitalization, and the use of \"the Government\" versus \"Government.\" The dictionary specifies that \"政府\" should be translated as \"the Government,\" \"government,\" or \"Government.\" While all are acceptable, \"the Government\" is more formal and appropriate for official sources like a statistics department.\n\"資料來源\" is translated as \"Data source\" or \"Source\" in the translations. The dictionary lists \"data\" and \"information\" for \"資料,\" but in this context, \"Data source\" is more precise and commonly used in captions.\n\"統計處\" is translated as \"Statistics Department\" in most translations, which is accurate. However, \"Statistics Office\" is also a possible translation, though \"Department\" is more common in official contexts.\n\"基本消費物價通脹\" is translated as \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" in several translations. This is accurate, though \"Basic\" may be redundant or unclear in this context. However, since the dictionary does not provide an alternative for \"基本,\" it is best to retain it unless it is clearly incorrect.\nThe punctuation and capitalization also vary. For example, \"Data source\" versus \"Data Source\" and the use of periods after the chart title. In formal captions, \"Data Source\" with a capital \"S\" is more standard.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be:\nChart 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data Source: the Government Statistics Department.\nThis version uses \"the Government\" as specified in the dictionary, capitalizes \"Data Source\" appropriately, and maintains clarity and formality.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labor market conditions remained resilient in 2018 (Chart 3). The unemployment rate fell from 3.1% for the whole year of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Among these, the unemployment rates in most major service sectors declined, especially in the accommodation and food services sector, where the decline was more significant. With the total number of employed persons and the number of job vacancies in private institutions further increasing, overall labor demand continued to strengthen, and the labor force participation rate also slightly rose. Under tightening labor market conditions, real wages and income further increased.\n\nChart 3: Labour Market Conditions  \nData Source: Government Statistics Department.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple caption for a chart, containing minimal content but requiring precise terminology. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, though with some inconsistencies in style and formatting.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Chart\" or \"Figure\" for \"圖\" and \"Labour Market Conditions\" for \"勞工市場狀況.\"\n- The term \"Government Statistics Department\" is the most accurate translation for \"政府統計處\" among the options provided.\n- Most translations use \"Data Source\" or \"Source,\" which are appropriate for \"資料來源.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and third translations use lowercase for \"labour market conditions,\" which is less formal and less consistent with standard English caption formatting.\n- The second translation uses \"Figure\" instead of \"Chart,\" which is acceptable but less common in this context.\n- The third translation uses \"the Government statistics department\" with unnecessary \"the\" and lowercase \"statistics,\" which is inconsistent with the formal tone expected in official captions.\n- The sixth translation uses \"Information source\" instead of \"Data source,\" which is less precise for \"資料來源\" in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Chart\" consistently, as it is the most direct and commonly used term for \"圖\" in captions.\n- Capitalize \"Labour Market Conditions\" to maintain a formal and consistent tone.\n- Use \"Data Source\" with a capital \"D\" to match the formal tone and standard usage.\n- Ensure \"Government Statistics Department\" is used consistently and correctly, without unnecessary articles or lowercase.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be:\n**Chart 3: Labour Market Conditions  \nData Source: Government Statistics Department.**\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify key terms such as \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"US-China trade tensions,\" and \"initial public offerings.\"\n- Most translations use \"Hang Seng\" consistently and correctly.\n- The use of \"Chart 4\" or \"Figure 4\" is appropriate, though \"Chart\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The translations generally convey the sharp decline in the stock market and the increase in trading volume and IPO fundraising.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical formatting:** Some translations use \"HK$882 billion\" while others use \"HK$88.2 billion.\" The correct format is \"HK$882 billion\" as per the dictionary entry for \"億\" (billion).\n- **\"First-time public offerings\" vs. \"initial public offerings\":** The dictionary specifies \"initial public offerings\" for \"招股,\" so \"first-time public offerings\" is incorrect.\n- **\"Owing to\" vs. \"due to\":** The dictionary specifies \"owing to\" for \"因,\" so \"due to\" should be replaced.\n- **\"Put\" vs. \"slow\":** The term \"放緩\" is translated as \"slow\" in some translations, which is correct, but \"slowed\" is more natural in this context.\n- **\"Figure 4\" vs. \"Chart 4\":** \"Chart\" is more appropriate in financial contexts.\n- **\"Funds raised\" vs. \"total amount raised\":** \"Total amount raised\" is more precise and matches the dictionary's \"total\" for \"總額.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best translation, we should:\n- Use \"Chart 4\" instead of \"Figure 4.\"\n- Use \"initial public offerings\" instead of \"first-time public offerings.\"\n- Use \"owing to\" instead of \"due to.\"\n- Use \"slowed\" instead of \"slow.\"\n- Ensure numerical formatting is consistent with \"billion\" and \"HK$.\"\n- Use \"total amount raised\" for \"總額.\"\n- Ensure fluency and natural phrasing while adhering to the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. The Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018, driven by the strong upward momentum of 2017 (Chart 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, US-China trade tensions intensified, and local economic growth slowed, triggering concerns among investors, market sentiment sharply reversed. The Hang Seng Index plunged to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed at 25,846 points at the end of the year, a 13.6% decline compared to a year ago. However, the average daily turnover rose from HK$882 billion in 2017 to HK$1,074 billion, and the total amount raised from initial public offerings also increased significantly owing to several companies in the emerging and tech sectors going public.\n\nChart 4 Asset Prices  \nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"US-China trade tensions,\" \"housing prices,\" \"price-to-income ratio,\" and \"rental yield.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"declined,\" \"fell,\" \"recorded,\" and \"remained\" to convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"moderated in the second half as US-China trade tensions rising\" (first translation), which lacks proper grammar.\n- The term \"most favorable interest rate\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary lists \"interest rates\" or \"interest rate\" as acceptable alternatives. \"Most favorable\" is not in the dictionary, so it should be replaced with \"local interest rates\" or \"interest rate.\"\n- The term \"transactions\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary lists \"turnover,\" \"transactions,\" or \"transaction volume\" as acceptable. \"Transactions\" is acceptable, but \"turnover\" may be more natural in this context.\n- Some translations use \"price-to-income ratio\" and \"income leverage ratio\" correctly, but the term \"leverage\" in the dictionary is \"leverage,\" so \"income leverage ratio\" is acceptable.\n- The phrase \"for the whole year\" is used in some translations, which is acceptable, but \"for the year as a whole\" or \"throughout 2018\" may be more natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, avoiding any additions or alterations.\n- Improve sentence structure and fluency by using more natural phrasing and avoiding awkward constructions.\n- Use \"local interest rates\" instead of \"most favorable interest rate\" to align with the dictionary.\n- Use \"turnover\" or \"transaction volume\" instead of \"transactions\" where appropriate.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"price-to-income ratio\" and \"income leverage ratio.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018, but cooled slightly in the second half as US-China trade tensions intensified, global stock markets adjusted, and local interest rates rose. Overall housing prices declined by 9% from their high levels between July and December, although they still recorded a 2% increase for the year as a whole (Chart 4). Due to a significant reduction in buying and selling activities in both the new and second-hand markets in the second half of the year, property transaction volumes in 2018 fell by 7% compared to the previous year, totaling 57,247 transactions. In addition, housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both significantly higher than the long-term average levels. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, though they slightly declined towards the end of the year. For the whole year, prices and rents both further increased, while the rental yield remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to the global economic slowdown, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth in 2019 will slow down. In particular, the external environment remains challenging, and Hong Kong's export performance is still expected to face pressure. Locally, although low unemployment rates and increased household income are expected to continue supporting private consumption, the growth of private consumption is anticipated to moderate due to weakened consumer confidence and the lingering effects of wealth impairment from earlier asset price adjustments. In terms of fixed capital formation, while housing supply increases should lead to steady growth in building and construction activities, businesses may become more prudent in their capital investment decisions in the face of heightened economic uncertainty. The Government forecasts that the real local GDP growth rate in 2019 will range between 2% and 3%, while the average growth rate predicted by private sector analysts is 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nOwing to the slowdown in global growth, including Hong Kong, external price and local cost pressures are expected to ease, thus inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2019. Recent declines in newly signed residential rental rates are also expected to exert a dampening effect on inflation. The market consensus forecasts the overall inflation rate in 2019 to be 2.2%, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.5%. It is expected that, under sustained economic growth and continued strong inbound tourism, the labor market conditions will remain tight. Private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainty Factors and Risks\n\nThe 2019 economic outlook is affected by uncertainties and risks including trade tensions, the future direction of US monetary policy, Mainland China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical situations. Additionally, if the aforementioned uncertainties intensify and continue in the long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be significantly affected, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and the physical economy.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, with its outlook remaining uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the outlook for Hong Kong's property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment conditions and income growth remain broadly stable, which could provide some support for residential property demand. The trajectory of Hong Kong interest rates to some extent depends on future policy rate changes in the US, though the latter's trajectory remains unclear. In the long term, due to increased residential completions over the past few years, combined with the government's efforts to increase land and housing supply, the housing supply-demand gap is expected to narrow.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nDespite the increase in external adverse factors, such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and interest rate normalization, which intensified financial market volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2018. The banking system's capital and liquidity conditions remained sound, with asset quality maintaining good levels. Rising interest rates widened interest margins, stimulating a significant increase in bank profits.\n\n# Assets and Liabilities Report Movements\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** uses \"banks’ sector\" which is awkward and not standard. It also uses \"progress steadily\" instead of \"continued steady growth,\" which is less natural. The phrase \"loan total increased by a growth of 4.4%\" is redundant and awkward.\n**Translation 2** is well-structured and fluent. It uses \"balance sheet\" correctly, which is more precise than \"assets and liabilities.\" It also uses \"businesses\" and \"mainland China\" appropriately. However, it uses \"continued economic uncertainty\" instead of \"continued uncertainty factors,\" which is slightly off from the original.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 2 and is also fluent. It uses \"businesses\" and \"mainland China\" correctly. However, it repeats \"loans used in Hong Kong\" and \"loans used outside Hong Kong\" without variation, which could be improved for readability.\n**Translation 4** uses \"assets and liabilities\" instead of \"balance sheet,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"triggered by both increases in loans used in Hong Kong\" which is slightly awkward. However, it uses \"Mainland China\" and \"trade finance fell\" which are good choices.\n**Translation 5** is very fluent and accurate. It uses \"balance sheet\" and \"Mainland China\" correctly. It also uses \"cautious\" instead of \"conservative,\" which is a more natural choice in this context. However, it uses \"have become\" instead of \"became,\" which slightly changes the tense.\n**Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 5 and is also fluent. It uses \"enterprises\" instead of \"businesses,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. It also uses \"fell by 7.6%\" which is more precise than \"declined by 7.6%.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nBased on the above review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent and accurate translations, using \"balance sheet,\" \"Mainland China,\" and \"cautious\" where appropriate. It would also ensure that all dictionary terms are translated correctly and that the overall tone is natural and professional.\n**Final Translation:**\nIn 2018, the banking system continued to grow steadily, with its balance sheet expanding by 5.9%. Facing ongoing economic uncertainty, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, enterprises became more cautious in obtaining new loans. The total loan growth rate slowed to 4.4% during the year, compared to 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing fell by 7.6% due to an uncertain global trade environment. Growth in related loans for Mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"accounted for\" and \"remained at a low level\" appropriately. It correctly uses \"owing to\" and accurately translates \"investment-grade debt securities.\" However, it omits the word \"continued\" from the original, which is present in the Chinese text.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"Banks’ sector holds of debt securities,\" which is awkward and ungrammatical. It also uses \"below a low level,\" which is redundant and incorrect. The term \"Government\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It includes \"continued to account for,\" which aligns with the original Chinese. It uses \"investment-grade debt securities\" correctly and \"remained at a low level\" appropriately. However, it uses \"the fact that\" unnecessarily, which slightly affects the flow.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is grammatically correct but ends with \"remained below,\" which is incomplete and grammatically incorrect. It also capitalizes \"Government\" inconsistently and uses \"credit risks\" instead of \"credit risk,\" which is not in line with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the third, with the same strengths and weaknesses. It uses \"has remained at a low level,\" which is slightly more formal than necessary but still correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It includes \"continued to account for,\" which is accurate. It uses \"investment-grade debt securities\" and \"credit risk remained at a low level\" correctly. It also capitalizes \"government\" appropriately and avoids unnecessary phrases like \"the fact that.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should include \"continued to account for\" to reflect the original Chinese's use of \"續\" (continued). It should use \"investment-grade debt securities\" as per the dictionary. It should use \"credit risk remained at a low level\" and ensure that \"government\" is not unnecessarily capitalized. It should also avoid unnecessary phrases like \"the fact that\" and ensure grammatical correctness.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking sector continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Owing to most of these debt securities being investment-grade debt securities issued by the government and banks, credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several common strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations accurately convey the core meaning of the original text, and most use appropriate financial terminology. However, there are variations in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"2018\" for \"2018年\" and \"US\" for \"美國.\"\n- The term \"deposits\" is consistently used for \"存款,\" and \"loan-to-deposit ratio\" is accurately translated for \"貸存比率.\"\n- The phrase \"funding costs\" is used appropriately for \"資金成本.\"\n- The term \"CASA\" is used in one translation for \"儲蓄,\" which is a valid and precise financial term.\n- The use of \"Chart 5\" for \"圖5\" is consistent across all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"current and savings deposits\" for \"往來及儲蓄存款,\" which is accurate, but \"demand deposits\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n- The term \"fixed-term deposits\" is used in one translation for \"定期存款,\" which is acceptable, but \"time deposits\" is more standard in banking terminology.\n- The phrase \"led to an increase in funding costs\" is used in some translations, but \"led to increased funding costs\" is more concise and natural.\n- The term \"moderates\" is used in one translation for \"稍,\" which is a bit awkward in the context of \"the overall loan-to-deposit ratio moderated.\"\n- Some translations use \"funds\" for \"資金,\" which is acceptable, but \"funding costs\" is more precise in the context of \"導致資金成本上升.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"demand deposits\" instead of \"current deposits\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"time deposits\" for \"定期存款\" as it is the standard term.\n- Use \"increased funding costs\" instead of \"an increase in funding costs\" for conciseness.\n- Replace \"moderates\" with \"slightly declined\" or \"slightly decreased\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, such as \"CASA\" for \"儲蓄\" when appropriate.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase than the 8.7% recorded in 2017. Due to expectations of continued interest rate hikes in the US, some banks raised time deposit interest rates to attract depositors to convert their demand and savings deposits into time deposits, thereby locking in funds. The share of demand and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to increased funding costs. As the growth of total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking sector has ample capital, indicating that it is equipped with a strong buffer to withstand potential shocks. The capital ratio has reached a historical high since the implementation of Basel III; the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 6: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\nThe original Chinese text is a title for a chart, and as such, it should be concise and precise. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in structure and fluency. \nTranslation 1 is grammatically correct but lacks clarity in the placement of \"Domestic\" and \"authorized.\" It reads as if \"Domestic\" is modifying \"Chart 6\" rather than \"institutions.\"\nTranslation 2 adds \"shows\" which is not present in the original text, making it more of a sentence than a title. It also uses \"registered and authorized\" which is accurate, but the addition of \"shows\" is unnecessary for a chart title.\nTranslation 3 is concise and follows the structure of the original, but it lacks the preposition \"of\" which is important for clarity in English titles.\nTranslation 4 uses \"Locally Registered\" which is slightly different from the original \"本地註冊\" which is more accurately translated as \"Local Registered.\"\nTranslation 5 is the most accurate in terms of structure and word choice, correctly using \"Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\" and placing \"Comprehensive Capital Ratio\" appropriately.\nTranslation 6 is similar to Translation 5 but adds a colon after \"Chart 6,\" which is a common and appropriate format for chart titles.\nConsidering all these translations, the best approach is to use the structure from Translation 6 with the accurate terminology from Translation 5. The final translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and accurately reflect the original Chinese title.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio came into effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation in the banking sector. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a title for a chart, which should be concise, clear, and grammatically correct. The key terms to translate are: 圖 (Chart), 7 (seven or 7), 本地 (local or domestic), 註冊 (registered), 認可 (authorized or authorization), 機構 (institutions), 綜合 (comprehensive, consolidated, overall, etc.), �槓桿 (leverage), 比率 (ratio).\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Chart 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Chart 7,\" \"Comprehensive Leverage Ratio,\" and \"Local Registered Authorized Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Authorized Institutions\" should be \"Authorized\" as an adjective, not a noun. Also, \"Registered Authorized\" should be \"Registered and Authorized\" for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Chart 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Chart 7,\" \"Comprehensive Leverage Ratio,\" and \"Local Registered and Authorized Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Comprehensive\" is a good choice for 綜合, but \"Ratio\" should be singular unless multiple ratios are being discussed.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Chart 7 of registered and authorized local institutions’ comprehensive leverage ratio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"registered and authorized local institutions\" and \"comprehensive leverage ratio.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Awkward phrasing with \"Chart 7 of...\" and possessive form \"institutions’\" is less formal and less common in chart titles.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Chart 7 Domestic registered authorized institutions’ overall leverage ratios\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Domestic\" for 本地 and \"overall\" for 綜合.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Domestic registered authorized institutions’\" is awkwardly phrased. \"Ratios\" is plural, which may not match the singular \"ratio\" in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Chart 7: Integrated Leverage Ratio of Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Integrated\" for 綜合 and \"Local Registered and Authorized Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Integrated\" is less common in financial contexts than \"Comprehensive\" or \"Overall.\" Also, the colon after \"Chart 7\" is not standard in chart titles.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Chart 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Comprehensive Leverage Ratio\" and \"Locally Registered Authorized Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\" is awkward. \"Authorized\" should be an adjective, not a noun.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terms in context. \"Comprehensive\" is the best fit for 綜合 in this context, as it conveys a broad, all-encompassing ratio. \"Local\" is more natural than \"Domestic\" in this context. \"Registered and Authorized\" should be used together for clarity. \"Institutions\" is the best choice for 機構 in this context. \"Leverage Ratio\" is the correct term for 槓桿比率. The title should be in the format \"Chart 7: [Title]\" for consistency with standard chart titles.\n**Improved Translation:**\nChart 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered and Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Conditions\n\nThe banking system's liquidity conditions remained resilient, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering one-month term funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also far above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Nevertheless, the operation of the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and currency markets remained smooth and orderly. The Linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand strong shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and fluent, with correct use of terms like \"Currency Board\" and \"monetary base.\" However, \"provide at least full support\" is slightly awkward and could be more natural as \"provide at least 100% support.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"Currency Board\" and \"Exchange Fund\" correctly, and the phrasing \"provide full backing\" is natural. However, \"make corresponding increase or decrease\" is slightly awkward compared to \"adjusted accordingly.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with correct use of terms. It uses \"100% support\" and \"fully matching the changes,\" which are natural and precise. However, the phrase \"provide at least 100% support\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified to \"provide 100% support.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version has some grammatical issues, such as \"Currency stability\" (should be lowercase unless it's a title), and \"required under which\" is awkward. The phrase \"supporting the percentage change\" is unclear and not in line with the original meaning.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is a strong translation with natural phrasing and correct use of terms. It uses \"100% alignment\" and \"adjusted accordingly,\" which are precise and fluent. However, \"maintaining a 100% alignment\" could be slightly more natural as \"maintaining a 100% correlation.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"100 percent support\" and \"maintaining a 100 percent correlation,\" which are accurate and natural. However, \"increased or decreased accordingly\" is slightly less concise than \"adjusted accordingly.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"Currency Board\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"monetary stability\" and \"currency stability\" appropriately, with \"currency stability\" being more precise in this context.\n- Use \"100% support\" and \"adjusted accordingly\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Ensure that \"Exchange Fund\" is used correctly and consistently.\n- Use \"monetary base\" and \"US dollar reserves\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar\" is clear and natural.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe principal objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the Currency Board system, which requires the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund to provide at least 100% support for the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, maintaining a 100% correlation with changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by three issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the Government\n- The aggregate balance in settlement accounts held by banks with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"firm commitment,\" \"Convertibility Undertaking,\" and \"exchange rate range.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the explanations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) actions are clear.\n- The use of \"aggregate balance\" or \"aggregate surplus\" is consistent with the dictionary term \"總結餘.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"total reserves\" (e.g., Translation 4), which is not an exact match for \"總結餘\" and may mislead readers.\n- The term \"currency convertibility undertaking\" (Translation 4) is not in the dictionary, and \"Convertibility Undertaking\" is the correct term.\n- Some translations use \"exchange guarantee\" (e.g., Translation 6), which is not in the dictionary. The correct term is \"Convertibility Undertaking.\"\n- The phrase \"strong-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate\" is repeated in some translations, which is redundant and could be simplified to \"strong-side exchange rate\" or \"strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate.\"\n- Some translations use \"bringing the exchange rate back down\" or \"back up,\" which is acceptable but could be more neutral, such as \"returning the exchange rate to the range.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Convertibility Undertaking\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Replace \"total reserves\" with \"aggregate balance\" or \"aggregate surplus\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use more neutral and precise language, such as \"returning the exchange rate to the range\" instead of \"bringing it back down\/up.\"\n- Ensure that the structure is clear and that the mechanism is explained logically without redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the Convertibility Undertaking. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars to banks and buy US dollars, increasing the aggregate balance and causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall, thereby returning the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars exceeds demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing the aggregate balance and driving up the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby returning the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which has driven carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which had been set at a level of 7.85 since 2005, was triggered for the first time. For the whole year, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times in 2018, with 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Nevertheless, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuating around the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 between mid-April and mid-September (Chart 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the tightening of interbank liquidity as holiday periods, quarter-end, and year-end approached, which triggered the unwinding of some carry trade positions. At the same time, to some extent, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported by the improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nChart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is \"圖1 2018年市場匯率,\" which translates to \"Chart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate.\" The dictionary provides specific translations for the terms \"圖,\" \"市場,\" \"匯率,\" \"1,\" and \"2018年.\" The correct translations are \"Chart,\" \"market,\" \"exchange rate,\" \"1,\" and \"2018,\" respectively.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\" – This is correct and follows the dictionary terms. The structure is natural and fluent.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 exchange rate market\" – This is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear. \"Exchange rate market\" is not a standard phrase and misplaces the terms.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 market exchange rate\" – This is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than the first translation. The phrase \"market exchange rate\" is acceptable but not as commonly used as \"market exchange rate\" in the context of a chart title.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\" – This is identical to the first translation and is correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\" – Same as the fourth, correct and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Chart 1 2018 Exchange Rate\" – This omits \"market,\" which is a key term in the original text. It is incomplete and does not fully reflect the original meaning.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text, use the dictionary terms correctly, and maintain natural English phrasing. The first, fourth, and fifth translations are all correct and natural. However, the first one is the most consistent in capitalization and structure, which is appropriate for a chart title.\n**Final Translation:**\nChart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nDue to the triggering of the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, the aggregate balance and the total outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds fell from HK$1,226.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 (Chart 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), purchased a total of HK$103.5 billion at the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate of 7.85 in response to banks' requests. As a result, the aggregate balance declined from HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018. The total outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds showed no significant change during the year. The Monetary Base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the aggregate outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds totaled 11,362 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nChart 2: 2018 Aggregate Balance of Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券,\" is a financial statement title, likely from a report or document detailing the status of financial instruments held by an Exchange Fund in 2018. The key terms to be translated are \"圖\" (Chart), \"2018年\" (2018), \"總結餘\" (aggregate balance), \"未償還\" (outstanding\/unpaid), \"外匯基金\" (Foreign Exchange Fund), \"票據\" (bills\/notes), and \"債券\" (bonds).\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Chart 2: 2018 Aggregate Balance and Unpaid Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Chart 2\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Unpaid\" is not the best match for \"未償還,\" which is more accurately \"outstanding\" in financial contexts. Also, \"Aggregate Balance\" is slightly awkward; \"Aggregate\" should modify \"Balance\" more clearly.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Chart 2 2018 aggregate balance and outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"outstanding\" correctly and \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Aggregate balance\" is missing a colon, and \"notes\" is less precise than \"bills\" for \"票據.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Chart 2 2018 Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"outstanding\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Aggregate Balance\" is awkwardly placed and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Chart 2 2018 aggregate in addition not outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bond securities.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"bills\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"In addition not outstanding\" is grammatically incorrect and confusing. \"Bond securities\" is redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Chart 2 2018 Aggregate Outstanding and Unpaid Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Aggregate\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Outstanding and Unpaid\" is redundant and unclear. \"Unpaid\" is not the best term for \"未償還.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Chart 2: Aggregate of Exchange Fund Bills, Notes, and Bonds Outstanding in 2018\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"outstanding\" and \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Aggregate of\" is awkward, and \"Notes\" is less precise than \"bills\" for \"票據.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Chart 2: 2018 Aggregate Balance of Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds.\" This version correctly uses \"outstanding\" for \"未償還,\" \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金,\" and \"bills and bonds\" for \"票據及債券.\" It also places \"Aggregate Balance\" in a natural and grammatically correct position.\n\n# Currency Market\n\nDue to the reduction in interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side convertibility undertaking, as well as market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) generally rose throughout 2018. Driven by increased demand for funds related to new share issue fundraising activities and seasonal liquidity demand, short-term interbank offered rates experienced greater volatility (Chart 3). Overall, short-term interbank offered rates remained broadly below the basic interest rate level throughout 2018. In view of rising funding costs in the banking system, following the upward adjustment of the U.S. federal funds rate target range in late September, banks increased their most favorable loan rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points.\n\nIn response to four rate increases totaling 100 basis points within the year, the target range for the U.S. Federal Funds Rate was raised from 1.25 to 1.50 percent to 2.25 to 2.50 percent. The basic interest rate was raised a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, increasing from 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the five-day moving average of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates, whichever is higher.\n\nChart 3 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of financial terminology. It correctly uses \"discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate\" and accurately conveys the timeline and figures. The only minor issue is the use of \"increased from 103 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2017 to 402 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2018\" — the numbers should be in the format \"HK$103 billion\" and \"HK$402 billion\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate, but it incorrectly uses \"10.3 billion HKD\" and \"40.2 billion HKD\" instead of \"103 billion\" and \"402 billion\" as stated in the original text. This is a significant error that changes the meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with correct use of financial terms. It uses \"HK$10.3 billion\" and \"HK$40.2 billion\" — again, a discrepancy from the original text. It also uses \"money market\" instead of \"currency market,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the third, with the same issue of using \"HK$10.3 billion\" and \"HK$40.2 billion\" instead of the correct figures. It also uses \"widened\" instead of \"expanded,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise in financial contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation contains a major error: \"Skip Lunch\" is used instead of the correct term for \"折\" (which should be \"discount\" or \"discount points\"). This is a direct result of using the dictionary incorrectly. It also uses \"HKD 10 billion\" and \"HKD 402 billion,\" which are inconsistent with the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"discount\" correctly, conveys the timeline and figures accurately, and uses \"HK$10.3 billion\" and \"HK$40.2 billion\" — again, a discrepancy from the original text. It also uses \"Currency market\" with a capital \"C,\" which is not standard.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The correct figures are \"103 billion\" and \"402 billion,\" not \"10.3 billion\" or \"40.2 billion.\"\n- \"Discount\" should be used consistently for \"折.\"\n- \"Currency market\" is more precise than \"money market.\"\n- \"Expanded\" is more appropriate than \"widened\" in financial contexts.\n- \"HK$\" should be used consistently with the correct figures.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate expanded in the first four months, broadly following the movements of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The 12-month forward exchange rate points for the Hong Kong dollar reached -620 points in mid-April (Chart 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed, the discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate slightly narrowed, before expanding again in the fourth quarter. Overall, Hong Kong's currency market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$103 billion in 2017 to HK$402 billion in 2018.\n\nChart 4: 2018 Forward Exchange Rate Points of US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and adherence to standard financial terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: \"Chart 4 2018 US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar Forward Exchange Rate Points\" – This translation is grammatically correct and uses formal terms like \"US Dollar\" and \"Hong Kong Dollar.\" However, the lack of a colon after \"Chart 4\" makes it slightly less formal and less common in financial contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator**: \"Chart 4 2018 US dollar against Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points\" – This is very similar to the first, but uses lowercase for \"dollar\" and \"exchange rate points.\" While this is not incorrect, it is less formal and may not be preferred in professional financial documents.\n3. **Third junior translator**: \"Chart 4 2018 USD against HKD forward exchange rate points\" – This translation is concise and uses standard abbreviations (USD and HKD), which are commonly used in financial contexts. However, it may be too abbreviated for a title that needs to be fully understandable to all readers.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: \"Chart 4 2018 US dollar against Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points\" – This is identical to the second translation and suffers from the same issues regarding formality and capitalization.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: \"Chart 4: 2018 Forward Exchange Rate Spread of US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar\" – This translation introduces the term \"Spread\" instead of \"Points,\" which may not be accurate. In the context of forward exchange rates, \"points\" typically refer to the numerical value of the rate, not the spread between two rates. This is a significant deviation from the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: \"Chart 4 2018 USD against Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points\" – This is similar to the third translation but uses a mix of abbreviations and full terms. It is concise but may not be as clear as a fully spelled-out version.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The title should be formal and clearly indicate that it is a chart.\n- The use of \"Chart 4:\" with a colon is standard in formal documents.\n- \"Forward Exchange Rate Points\" is the most accurate translation of \"遠期匯率點子\" and should be used as is.\n- \"US Dollar\" and \"Hong Kong Dollar\" are the most formal and widely understood terms in financial contexts.\n- The term \"against\" is correctly used to denote the exchange rate between two currencies.\n- The use of \"of\" in \"Forward Exchange Rate Points of US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar\" provides clarity and grammatical correctness.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nChart 4: 2018 Forward Exchange Rate Points of US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented since 1983, has consistently served as a cornerstone for maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and financial system. It has demonstrated its ability to withstand significant shocks during multiple regional and global financial crises. Due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which is part of the LERS design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. The outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar is an inevitable process in the normalization of interest rates and is a normal operation under the LERS. To enhance public understanding of the operations and mechanisms of the LERS, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made concerted efforts to explain the technical details of the system to the public and to demonstrate the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system in responding to shocks. The government has also firmly maintained the LERS. The foreign exchange and money markets have remained stable, further reinforcing public confidence in the government’s commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value. During the 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, noting that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, serving as a pillar of stability that helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the large-scale services sector.\n\nIn view of the critical role of a resilient banking system in the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintains supervision over banks' corporate, property-related, and Mainland China-related loans to ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks. Banks hold a large amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds, which can be used through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is always prepared to adjust the issuance of Exchange Fund bills and bonds to provide additional liquidity in response to potential sharp outflows of funds from the Hong Kong dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to be prepared for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 109.9% on December 31 (Chart 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's vast financial resources can serve as a powerful backstop to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability when facing sudden shocks.\n\nChart 5 2018 Daily Changes in Support Ratio\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\nThe term \"貨幣發行委員會\" translates to \"Currency Issuance Committee\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The word \"發行\" is best translated as \"issuance\" in this context, as it refers to the act of issuing currency. \"委員會\" is translated as \"Committee,\" which is the most appropriate term in this context. The use of \"Currency\" for \"貨幣\" is also appropriate as it refers to the general concept of money. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but \"Currency Issue Committee\" and \"Currency issue Committee\" are less precise than \"Currency Issuance Committee.\" The use of \"issuance\" is more formal and appropriate for a committee that deals with the issuance of currency.\n\nThe original text discusses the responsibilities and activities of the Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, focusing on topics related to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** This version correctly identifies the \"Currency Authority Committee\" as a sub-committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. However, \"Currency Authority Committee\" is not an exact match for the original term, which is \"貨幣發行委員會\" (Currency Issuance Committee). The term \"MAC\" is not defined in the dictionary, and \"Monetary Authority Committee\" is not a standard term. The translation is fluent but misrepresents the committee's name.\n2. **Second Translation:** This version uses \"Currency Issuance Committee\" correctly and aligns with the dictionary. However, \"Currency Issuance Committee\" is not a standard term in English financial contexts. The phrase \"foreign banks\" is used instead of \"offshore banks,\" which is less precise. The term \"enhancement initiatives\" is acceptable, but \"3 enhancement initiatives\" should be \"three enhancement initiatives\" for consistency.\n3. **Third Translation:** This version is the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure. It correctly uses \"Currency Issuance Committee\" and \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\" The phrase \"offshore banks\" is appropriate. However, \"theoretical basis\" is slightly less precise than \"theoretical frameworks\" or \"theoretical foundations.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation:** This version incorrectly refers to the committee as the \"Monetary Policy Division,\" which is not the correct term. The term \"Monetary Policy Division\" is not in the dictionary and is not an accurate translation of \"貨幣發行委員會.\" The translation is fluent but misrepresents the committee's name.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** This version correctly identifies the committee as the \"Monetary Policy Division\" but again misrepresents the name. It uses \"USD loans\" instead of \"US dollar loans,\" which is acceptable but less formal. The phrase \"three optimization measures\" is correct, and the translation is fluent.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** This version incorrectly refers to the committee as the \"Currency Board Sub-Committee,\" which is not the correct term. The term \"Currency Board\" is used for \"發行局\" (Currency Board), not the committee itself. The translation is fluent but misrepresents the committee's name and structure.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe third translation is the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure. It correctly identifies the committee as the \"Currency Issuance Committee\" and uses the appropriate terms from the dictionary. However, \"Currency Issuance Committee\" is not a standard term in English financial contexts. A more standard term would be \"Currency Issuance Committee\" or \"Monetary Issuance Committee,\" but the dictionary does not provide an exact equivalent. Therefore, the best approach is to use the term \"Currency Issuance Committee\" as it is the closest match in the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Currency Issuance Committee, a sub-committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining topics related to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system. In 2018, the topics discussed by the Currency Issuance Committee included the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of US dollar loans to offshore banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of the demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical frameworks of the Linked Exchange Rate System since the implementation of three optimization measures. The minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the Currency Board system operation reports submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are all available on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre (Research Centre) continues to support research on monetary policy, the banking sector, and financial areas. Over the past four years, the Research Centre has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, as evidenced by the seminars it has hosted and the visiting scholars programme. On one hand, the Research Centre collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to jointly host more policy-related seminars. On the other hand, in 2016, it launched a specialized research scholars programme to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the Research Centre invited a total of 16 research scholars to visit and published 25 research papers. During the year, the Research Centre also hosted four international conferences:\n- The \"9th China Economic Annual International Conference,\" held in January, with the theme \"China's Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" The conference was jointly co-organised by the Research Centre, the Market Economy Research Institute of the State Council Development Research Centre, and the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China, focusing on topics and risks related to the mainland's real estate market.\n- The \"Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Framework\" conference, held in October, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements. The conference was one of the celebratory events marking the 20th anniversary of the Bank for International Settlements' Asia-Pacific region office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within the monetary policy framework.\n- The \"Annual Conference on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure 2018,\" held in November. The conference discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and policy implications related to recent developments in financial market microstructure.\n- The \"China Experts' Network Conference on China's New Era,\" held in November, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the European Central Bank, and the US Federal Reserve. The conference discussed pressing issues facing the mainland economy and their impact on the global economy, with particular emphasis on policy issues relevant to central bank decision-makers. This was the first time the China Experts' Network Conference was held outside of Europe.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

The effectiveness of the liquidity and credit risk management systems of authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) during the year. In view of the continued increase in cyber threats and the more widespread use of financial technology in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of the technology risk management and operational resilience of authorized institutions. The HKMA also issued a revised version of the \"Guidelines on the Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May and began processing applications for the authorization of virtual banks. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen the supervision of the practices used by authorized institutions in selling investment and insurance products, promote barrier-free banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to harness new technology and risk-based approaches to enhance Hong Kong’s resilience in countering money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made substantial progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large risk exposure limits. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to ensure Hong Kong has a credible authorized institution resolution mechanism, including the introduction of rules specifying minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements, to address a major obstacle facing the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it is essential to establish and maintain a financial system with strong resilience that can provide the critical financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system owing to their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly closures. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent closures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The HKMA is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure that the financial system is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong's prudential regulatory regime was not established to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that if an authorized institution can no longer operate sustainably, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for several financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish a smoothly operating Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the Monetary Authority's operational capacity to resolve authorized institutions that are no longer able to operate. To effectively carry out the above tasks, the Monetary Authority needs to adopt methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Oversight\n\nThe HKMA conducted a total of 187 non-site reviews in 2018, covering a wide range of areas, including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations and risk management, as well as the business strategies of authorized institutions in response to the development of fintech. To continue enhancing the risk governance level of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or their committees, and followed up on the progress of authorized institutions in implementing corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to non-on-site review work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct regular on-site inspections, supported by thematic assessments, to examine areas assessed as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA conducted a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management in its reviews and assessments. Other key areas include technology risk and operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Special inspection teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related operations.\n\nTable 1 sets out an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nIn reviewing the translations, several observations can be made regarding their quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"credit growth,\" \"total loan amount,\" and \"contraction in credit demand.\" It correctly uses \"Table 2\" and \"increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment.\" However, it uses \"leading to\" which is slightly less formal than \"resulted in.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"resulted in\" instead of \"leading to.\" It also uses \"loan growth\" consistently and correctly.\n3. **Translation 3** contains a significant error: it uses \"loan growth relief\" instead of \"credit growth slowed.\" This misinterpretation of the term \"緩\" (relief) is incorrect in context. It also uses \"Growing uncertainty\" with a capital \"G,\" which is unnecessary and stylistically inconsistent.\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"contracted by 7.6%\" for \"貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%.\" It also uses \"increasing uncertainty\" and \"contraction in credit demand\" effectively. The use of \"which resulted in\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 1 and 2, with the only difference being the use of \"contraction in credit demand\" instead of \"contraction of credit demand.\" Both are acceptable, but \"contraction in\" is slightly more natural in this context.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most precise and formal, using \"primarily due to\" instead of \"mainly due to,\" which is a more formal and nuanced choice. It also uses \"leading to\" and is consistent with the dictionary terms.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the most natural phrasing while adhering strictly to the dictionary. Based on the above, Translation 6 is the most refined, with the best use of vocabulary and structure. However, \"leading to\" can be slightly less formal than \"resulted in,\" and \"primarily\" is more formal than \"mainly.\" A balanced approach would use \"primarily due to\" and \"resulted in\" for precision and formality.\n**Improved Translation:**\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with the total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the whole year, compared to an increase of 16.1% in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was primarily due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, resulting in a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward economic report, stating that the total amount of related loans in Mainland China increased by 1.4% to 42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars by the end of 2018, and that this increase was lower than the one in 2017. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly used appropriate terms, though with some inconsistencies and errors.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Mainland China\" correctly, \"HK$42,490 billion\" is a valid representation of \"42,490億港元.\" However, \"at the end of 2018\" is slightly awkward compared to \"by the end of 2018.\" Also, \"below the increase in 2017\" is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than \"lower than the growth rate in 2017.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Mainland China’s related loan total\" which is slightly awkward. \"42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars\" is correct, but \"by the end of 2018\" is better than \"at the end of 2018.\" \"Below the growth in 2017\" is acceptable but could be more precise.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"lower than the 2017 growth rate\" which is more natural than \"below the increase in 2017.\" However, \"42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars\" is correct, and \"by the end of 2018\" is better than \"at the end of 2018.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"HKD 42,490 billion\" which is correct, and \"lower than the growth rate in 2017\" is natural. However, \"which was lower than the growth rate in 2017\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Contains a critical error: \"HK$424.9 billion\" instead of \"42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars.\" This is a significant numerical error. \"Lower than the growth rate in 2017\" is correct, but the number is wrong.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars\" and \"lower than the growth rate in 2017.\" However, \"at the end of 2018\" is slightly less natural than \"by the end of 2018.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Mainland China\" or \"Mainland\" as appropriate.\n- Use \"42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars\" or \"HK$42,490 billion\" for \"42,490億港元.\"\n- Use \"by the end of 2018\" for \"在2018年底.\"\n- Use \"lower than the growth rate in 2017\" for \"低於2017年的增幅.\"\n- Ensure the sentence is fluent and grammatically correct.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe total amount of related loans in Mainland China increased by 1.4% to HK$42,490 billion by the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Mainland China Related Loan Growth\nThe junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in punctuation and capitalization. The most fluent and appropriately formatted translation is \"Table 3: Mainland China Related Loan Growth,\" which uses proper title case and includes a colon after the table number. This format is standard in formal reports and ensures clarity and professionalism. The term \"Mainland China\" is the most appropriate translation for \"內地\" in this context, as it refers to the People's Republic of China as opposed to Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. \"Related\" is the best choice for \"相關,\" and \"Loan Growth\" accurately reflects \"貸款增長.\" The use of \"Table\" with a capital \"T\" is correct, and the inclusion of a colon after the number is standard in English for such headings. The translation is concise, accurate, and adheres to English formatting conventions.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" and \"resilient\" for \"穩健.\"\n- The term \"specific classified loan ratio\" is consistently used, aligning with the dictionary's \"specific classification\" and \"loan.\"\n- The use of \"well below\" for \"遠低於\" is accurate and natural.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the comparative data over time.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Authorization institutions\"** (used in Translation 4) is incorrect; the correct term is \"authorized institutions\" as per the dictionary.\n- **\"Overall banking sector\"** (used in Translation 4) should be \"overall banking sector\" but with consistent capitalization.\n- **\"Mainland China-related loans\"** (used in Translation 2 and 6) is more natural than \"related loans in Mainland China.\"\n- **\"The quality of assets\"** (Translation 3) is slightly awkward compared to \"asset quality.\"\n- **\"Authorization (context-specific, as above)\"** is not used in any translation, but \"authorized\" is the correct term.\n- **\"The ratio of classified loans\"** (Translation 5) omits \"specific,\" which is critical for precision.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"authorized institutions\" and \"specific classified loan ratio.\"\n- Use \"Mainland China-related loans\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Maintain consistent capitalization and terminology.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used as specified, particularly \"authorized\" and \"specific classified.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions remained resilient in 2018. The specific classified loan ratio for retail banks fell from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector declined from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding Mainland China-related loans, the specific classified loan ratio for retail banks dropped from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the related ratio for the overall banking sector also fell from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority strengthened supervision to ensure authorized institutions continued to adopt prudent credit risk management guidelines. In particular, the Authority actively sought to understand the background and structure of large corporations, thereby enhancing the oversight system for corporate credit risk. In addition, the Authority conducted focused assessments on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for property developers' loans, secured loans, and policy-backed loans.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures introduced since October 2009 have strengthened the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system in withstanding potential reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans fell from 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in September 2009 to 46% in December 2018. The average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% when the relevant ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 to 34% in December 2018 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Average Mortgage Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for New Residential Mortgages\n\n# Regulatory Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"cybersecurity\" and \"authorized institutions.\" However, \"risk-based cyber attack simulation tests\" may be slightly off in context compared to the original, which refers to \"風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試\" (risk information-driven network attack and defense simulation tests).\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. The term \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" is appropriate, and the use of \"risk-based network attack and defense simulation tests\" is close to the original. However, \"first-period arrangement\" is awkward and should be \"first phase.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in meaning and uses \"HKMA\" consistently. The phrase \"risk information-driven cyber attack and defense simulation tests\" is accurate. However, \"corrective measures\" is slightly less precise than \"remedial measures\" in the context of regulatory compliance.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"Network Defense Assessment Framework,\" which is a valid alternative. The use of \"risk information-led network attack and defense simulation tests\" is appropriate. However, \"enhance network defense\" is slightly less formal than \"strengthen network defense.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. The term \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework\" is a valid alternative. However, \"risk information-led cyber attack simulation tests\" omits the \"defense\" part of the original, which is important for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. The use of \"risk information-driven cyber attack and defense simulation testing\" is precise. The term \"drawn up a timetable\" is appropriate, and the use of \"cyber security controls\" is consistent with the original.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"評估\" should be translated as \"assessment\" or \"evaluation\" depending on context.\n- \"資訊\" should be translated as \"information.\"\n- \"進\" should be translated as \"implement\" or \"roll out.\"\n- \"2016\" should remain as \"2016.\"\n- \"年\" should be translated as \"year.\"\n- \"已\" should be translated as \"have\" or \"already.\"\n- \"涵蓋\" should be translated as \"cover.\"\n- \"面對\" should be translated as \"face.\"\n- \"內\" should be translated as \"in.\"\n- \"銀行\" should be translated as \"banks.\"\n- \"時間\" should be translated as \"time.\"\n- \"有助\" should be translated as \"helps\" or \"facilitates.\"\n- \"機構\" should be translated as \"institutions.\"\n- \"時\" should be translated as \"during.\"\n- \"第三\" should be translated as \"third.\"\n- \"措施\" should be translated as \"measures.\"\n- \"管治\" should be translated as \"governance.\"\n- \"表\" should be translated as \"report.\"\n- \"範疇\" should be translated as \"areas.\"\n- \"風險\" should be translated as \"risk.\"\n- \"外\" should be translated as \"external.\"\n- \"高\" should be translated as \"high.\"\n- \"安排\" should be translated as \"arrangements.\"\n- \"期\" should be translated as \"phase.\"\n- \"推出\" should be translated as \"launched.\"\n- \"兩\" should be translated as \"two.\"\n- \"及\" should be translated as \"and.\"\n- \"保\" should be translated as \"Protection.\"\n- \"3\" should be translated as \"3.\"\n- \"包括\" should be translated as \"including.\"\n- \"科技\" should be translated as \"technology.\"\n- \"管控\" should be translated as \"controls.\"\n- \"現場\" should be translated as \"on-site.\"\n- \"制定\" should be translated as \"formulated.\"\n- \"實施\" should be translated as \"implementation.\"\n- \"於\" should be translated as \"in.\"\n- \"需\" should be translated as \"need.\"\n- \"第\" should be translated as \"first.\"\n- \"框架\" should be translated as \"framework.\"\n- \"間\" should be translated as \"institutions.\"\n- \"「\" should be translated as \"“.\"\n- \"認可\" should be translated as \"authorized.\"\n- \"運作\" should be translated as \"operations.\"\n- \"行\" should be translated as \"Bank.\"\n- \"查\" should be translated as \"review.\"\n- \"業\" should be translated as \"sector.\"\n- \"」\" should be translated as \"”.\"\n- \"餘\" should be translated as \"remaining.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe technology-related risks faced by the banking sector remain relatively high. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework.\" The first phase implementation arrangements cover 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed three stages of assessment: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and (if applicable) risk information-driven network attack and defense simulation tests. These assessments help authorized institutions identify areas of operations requiring improvement and take remedial measures to strengthen network defense. At the same time, the HKMA has formulated a timeline for the implementation arrangements of the second and third phases, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. During the year, the HKMA conducted on-site reviews, focusing on examining the network security control measures, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (e.g., HKMA, fintech, Regtech) and the main actions (e.g., collaboration, issuing guidelines, streamlining requirements).\n- Most translations use appropriate terms from the dictionary, such as \"streamline\" for 精簡, \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" for 虛擬銀行的認可, and \"Regtech\" for 金融合規科技.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"Banking Easy\" instead of \"Banking Easy\" (though this is a minor issue). It also uses \"quadrupled\" for 擴大至, which is incorrect.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"Banking Easy\" instead of \"Banking Easy\" and \"Banking Easy\" instead of \"Banking Easy\" (again, minor). It also uses \"counter-financing of terrorism\" for 恐怖分子資金籌集, which is not the best match.\n- **Translation 3** incorrectly uses \"quadrupled\" for 擴大至 and \"Bank Easy\" instead of \"Banking Easy.\"\n- **Translation 4** is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage and fluency, but it uses \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech\" in one instance.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Banking Ease\" instead of \"Banking Easy\" and \"online lending\" instead of \"online loans.\"\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, but it uses \"guidelines\" instead of \"guideline\" and \"Banking Easy\" instead of \"Banking Easy.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"Banking Easy\" consistently, as it is the most accurate term for 銀行易.\n- The term \"quadrupled\" is incorrect for 擴大至; the correct term is \"expanded.\"\n- The phrase \"counter-financing of terrorism\" is not the best match for 恐怖分子資金籌集; \"financing of terrorism\" is more appropriate.\n- The term \"fintech\" should be used consistently for 金融科技.\n- The phrase \"financial compliance technology\" should be used for 金融合規科技.\n- The term \"streamline\" is the best match for 精簡.\n- The term \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" should be used for 虛擬銀行的認可.\n- The term \"machine-readable\" should be used for \"機器可讀.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the seven measures promoting smart banking, which were announced in September 2017, to foster the development of fintech in Hong Kong. In terms of regulation, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" guideline in May. In addition, under the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has streamlined the regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online loans, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. The scope of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative was expanded in September to promote banks' adoption of financial compliance technology (Regtech), with three new focus areas including monitoring technology for combating money laundering and financing of terrorism, financial compliance technology used for prudent risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Yuen Kwok-hang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018,\" hosted by the Hong Kong Banking Association.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nAs the US monetary policy continues to normalize, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its supervision of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. During the year, the HKMA conducted a round of focused assessments to evaluate the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of US dollar liquidity, as well as their capacity to conduct internal liquidity stress tests. In addition, the HKMA also monitors the compliance of authorized institutions with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirements that came into effect in January.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) review activities, focusing on market risk management and compliance with international standards in treasury operations. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Generally accurate, but uses \"focused on-site review on\" which is slightly awkward. Also, \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" is correct, but \"compliance of authorized institutions with\" is slightly less natural than \"compliance by authorized institutions with.\"\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"non-central counterparties\" instead of \"non-central clearing,\" which is a misinterpretation. Also, \"risk relief\" is not the best match for \"風險緩解\" in this context; \"risk mitigation\" is more appropriate.\n3. **Third Translation:** Correctly uses \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" and \"non-central clearing over-the-counter derivatives.\" However, \"Exchange Fund Authority\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"Global Foreign Exchange Guidelines\" instead of \"Global Foreign Exchange Code,\" which is a misrepresentation. Also, \"review the situation of authorized institutions' compliance\" is awkward.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"bond portfolios\" correctly and \"risk relief\" instead of \"risk mitigation,\" which is less precise. Also, \"not centrally cleared\" is correct, but \"treasury business\" is less formal than \"treasury operations.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Accurately uses \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" and \"non-central settlement over-the-counter derivatives.\" However, \"targeting\" is slightly less precise than \"focused on\" or \"conducted a focused on-site review of.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" as the correct name.\n- Use \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"risk mitigation\" instead of \"risk relief\" for \"風險緩解.\"\n- Use \"non-central clearing\" for \"非中央結算.\"\n- Use \"treasury operations\" for \"財資業務.\"\n- Use \"focused on-site review\" for \"專題現場審查.\"\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn addition to reviewing the market risk management of bond portfolios of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a focused on-site review of the margin and risk mitigation standards under the Global Foreign Exchange Code and non-central clearing over-the-counter derivatives, to examine the compliance of authorized institutions with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the report's title and its publication date as April.\n- Most translations accurately convey the main idea that Hong Kong's banking system faces high money laundering threats, similar to other international financial centers.\n- The mention of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) assisting the government in formulating a policy statement is consistently included.\n- The key terms such as \"money laundering,\" \"financing of terrorism,\" and \"legitimate businesses\" are generally well translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations suffer from grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. For example, the fourth translation uses \"face(s)\" and \"activity\" without proper pluralization, and \"facilitate bona fide corporate(s)\" is awkwardly phrased.\n- **Dictionary Compliance:** The dictionary specifies that \"地位\" should be translated as \"position,\" \"standing,\" \"role,\" or \"status.\" While most translations use \"position\" or \"status,\" the fourth translation uses \"hub for payments and trade\" without explicitly using the dictionary term \"position.\"\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** The term \"打擊\" is translated as \"combating\" or \"counter,\" but the dictionary provides \"anti-\" or \"harnessing... anti-.\" The best fit is \"anti-\" or \"combating.\"\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations are overly literal, such as \"set out in responses to these threats\" in the second translation, which is not idiomatic English.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms where applicable.\n- It should avoid awkward phrasing and ensure that the meaning is clear and natural in English.\n- The term \"地位\" should be translated as \"position\" or \"status\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"正當\" should be translated as \"legitimate\" or \"bona fide,\" with \"legitimate\" being more natural in this context.\n- The term \"體系\" should be translated as \"system\" or \"sector,\" with \"system\" being more appropriate for \"banking system.\"\n- The term \"協助\" should be translated as \"assisted\" or \"assist,\" with \"assisted\" being more natural in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the strengths of the various translations, ensuring fluency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Government's *Report on the Assessment of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Risks in Hong Kong*, published in April, notes that Hong Kong's banking system faces a high threat of money laundering, similar to other international financial centres, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats faced by Hong Kong originate not only from local criminal activities but to a greater extent from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illegal gains from corruption abroad, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong's position as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Government formulated a policy statement on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, setting out responses to these threats. The objective is to enhance the resilience of the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism systems while also attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is generally accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Ordinance\" and \"Amendment\" as per the dictionary. However, \"developing the use of technology to facilitate customer account opening\" is slightly awkward. The phrase \"thereby comprehensively strengthening the system\" is well phrased.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"utilizing technology to develop convenient customer account opening services,\" which is a natural phrasing. The use of \"bear responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing\" is appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"align with the development of authorized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account opening,\" which is a natural and precise expression. The phrase \"assume responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism\" is well chosen.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but slightly less fluent. The phrase \"preventing money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism\" is slightly redundant. Also, \"property agents\" is less precise than \"real estate agents.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"in order to support authorized institutions utilising technology to facilitate the development of client account opening,\" which is a natural expression. The phrase \"systems for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism\" is well phrased.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very poor. It contains numerous grammatical errors and uses incorrect terms, such as \"grant靈活\" and \"execution work anti-financing of terrorism.\" It also fails to use the correct English equivalents for many terms in the dictionary.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, ensuring that all terms from the dictionary are correctly used and that the English is natural and fluent.\nThe best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is:\nThe \"2018 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance\" came into operation on March 1, introducing amendments that include granting flexibility in verifying customer identities to align with the development of authorized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account opening. The new legislation also expands the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to assume responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, thereby comprehensively strengthening the system against money laundering and terrorist financing. These amendments, together with revisions to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, help authorized institutions carry out their work in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with authorized institutions regarding anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism policies and regulatory approaches, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a new unit titled \"Regulatory Approaches to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" under the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in October, as well as the \"Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)\" in conjunction with relevant legislative amendments, in order to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies for anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism systems.\n\nThe original text discusses the growing importance of information exchange in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, highlighting the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks in supporting the banking sector's participation in an intelligence working group. It also notes the review of a pilot program for this group, which began in late 2018 and is expected to conclude in early 2019.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"information exchange\" and \"anti-money laundering\" correctly, but \"information Committee\" is awkward and unclear. The phrase \"will be opened at the end of 2018\" misrepresents the original meaning of \"review... will be opened\" as \"review... commenced.\"\n2. **Second Translation:** Accurately uses \"information sharing\" and \"HKMA\" with proper abbreviations. However, \"Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Committee\" is overly repetitive and lacks clarity. The phrase \"is expected to be completed\" is slightly less precise than \"will be completed.\"\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"information sharing\" and \"HKAB\" correctly. The term \"Intelligence Working Group\" is more appropriate than \"Committee.\" The phrase \"commenced at the end of 2018\" is accurate and natural.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"relentlessly participates\" which is not the best fit for \"積極\" (actively). Also, \"the work of the Intelligence Committee\" is awkward and less direct than \"the Intelligence Committee.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism\" which is slightly more natural than \"systems.\" However, \"Banking Association\" is not the exact term from the dictionary, which lists \"Association of Banks\" or \"Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\"\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"working group on anti-fraud and money laundering intelligence\" which is clear and natural. The phrase \"was launched at the end of 2018\" is slightly less precise than \"commenced\" or \"began.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"information sharing\" or \"information exchange\" as appropriate.\n- Accurately reflect the role of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n- Use \"Intelligence Working Group\" rather than \"Committee\" for clarity.\n- Use \"commenced\" or \"began\" for the review of the pilot program.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most appropriate English alternatives.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe role of information sharing in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism is becoming increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector has actively participated in the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group), and has already achieved substantial results. The review of the pilot programme of the Intelligence Working Group commenced at the end of 2018 and will be completed at the beginning of 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment industries have made good progress during the year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" being the best example.\n\nChina's mainland and Hong Kong's capital market mutual connectivity plan has launched optimization measures, as well as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, further strengthening Hong Kong's unique position as the main gateway to China's mainland. Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub is also more stable, with thriving RMB financial activities in Hong Kong.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to creating new opportunities and further enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centres, and the green bond market. The HKMA has also strengthened its market promotion plan to promote Hong Kong's strengths to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On the international stage, the HKMA plays a leading role in multiple regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to implementing seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. Major progress achieved within the year on these seven initiatives to drive smart banking includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the Faster Payment System \"FPS\", fully connecting different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as \"e-wallets\");\n- Published the framework for open application programming interfaces (Open API) in the banking industry and promoted the implementation of open APIs;\n- Enhanced fintech research and talent training;\n- Strengthened cross-border fintech collaboration;\n- Revised the \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" guideline and processed virtual bank license applications;\n- The upgraded version of the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly; and\n- Expanded \"Banking Easy\" to promote banks' adoption of financial compliance technology.\n\nThe original sentence is about the role of the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in promoting the implementation of certain measures, in collaboration with the HKMA’s banking departments. The dictionary provides several options for key terms, and the translations by junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Services and Markets Commission\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"Linked with\" is awkward and not idiomatic. The term \"Financial Technology Facilitation Office\" is acceptable, but the agency name is wrong.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA. Uses \"above measures\" instead of \"these measures,\" which is less natural in this context. The term \"Financial Services Technology Promotion Office\" is not standard and may confuse readers.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"departments of banks under the HKMA,\" which is slightly awkward. The phrase \"departments of banks\" is not the best way to express \"banking departments\" of the HKMA.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is imprecise. Also, \"promoting and implementing\" is redundant and less concise than \"promoting the implementation.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA and uses \"various banking departments of the HKMA,\" which is accurate and natural. The phrase \"promoting the implementation of these measures\" is clear and idiomatic.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses an incorrect and overly long name for the authority: \"Office of the Commissioner of Banking and Finance.\" Also, \"promoting and implementing\" is redundant and less concise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the FFO as part of the HKMA.\n- Use \"these measures\" instead of \"above measures\" for clarity and natural flow.\n- Use \"banking departments\" of the HKMA, not \"departments of banks.\"\n- Use \"promoting the implementation\" rather than \"promoting and implementing\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" or \"Financial Technology Facilitation Office\" as appropriate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the HKMA’s banking departments, plays an important role in promoting the implementation of these measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimization measures for the mutual access plan between mainland China and Hong Kong's capital markets, Hong Kong's unique position as the main gateway to mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the \"Bond Connect\" with the immediate delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement model, along with the State Council's announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors investing in China's domestic bond market, has further enhanced the plan's efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also closely collaborated with mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial supporting measures, facilitating individuals and businesses living, working, and conducting business in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong's offshore renminbi business continues to thrive, with the renminbi deposit liquidity pool rising by 6% year-on-year to 657.7 billion yuan; the average daily transaction value of the renminbi real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system reached a high level of 101.01 billion yuan.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This version uses \"relentlessly opening up further opportunities\" which is slightly awkward. It correctly uses \"worked closely with\" and \"tax exemption,\" but \"Green finance\" should be \"Green finance\" (capitalized as per the dictionary). The term \"corporate treasury Centre\" is correctly capitalized.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is fluent and accurate. It uses \"actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance\" which is natural. It correctly uses \"working closely with\" and \"tax exemptions.\" The term \"infrastructure financing\" is appropriate, and \"corporate treasury\" is correctly used.\n3. **Third Translation**: This version uses \"Bond Funding Pilot Scheme\" instead of \"Bond Subsidy Pilot Programme,\" which is not the exact match from the dictionary. It uses \"collaborates closely with\" which is acceptable. The term \"tax-exempt bond investment income\" is correct, and \"corporate treasury centers\" is appropriately capitalized.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This is very similar to the second and is fluent. It uses \"working closely with\" and \"tax exemption.\" The term \"communicating Hong Kong's strengths\" is slightly less precise than \"promoting,\" but it is still acceptable. \"Green finance\" is correctly capitalized.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"implemented\" and \"worked closely with\" correctly. The term \"corporate treasury centres\" is appropriately capitalized. It uses \"various large-scale and specialized outreach events\" which is natural.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version uses \"relentlessly opening up new opportunities\" which is slightly awkward. It uses \"Consolidated Qualified Debt Securities Scheme\" which is not the exact match from the dictionary. It uses \"external and Mainland stakeholders\" which is acceptable, but \"external events\" is not the best choice for \"outreach events.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should use \"Bond Subsidy Pilot Programme\" as per the dictionary, \"worked closely with,\" and \"tax exemption.\" It should also use \"Green finance\" with a capital \"G\" and \"corporate treasury Centre\" with a capital \"C.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong's bond market, the HKMA has implemented the \"Bond Subsidy Pilot Programme\" proposed in the Financial Budget, providing subsidies to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong, and worked closely with the Government to revise legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the \"Eligible Debt Securities Scheme.\" The HKMA has also intensified its market promotion activities, promoting Hong Kong's strengths to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing a number of large-scale and focused outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for Green finance, infrastructure finance, and corporate treasury Centre.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) leads multiple regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, as a member of the Task Force on Regulatory and Implementation Guidelines under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and as Chairman of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and translate key terms from the dictionary, such as \"香港\" (Hong Kong), \"CMU系統\" (CMU system), and \"債券通\" (Bond Connect).\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"system availability rate\" and \"central securities custody institutions.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"laid a solid foundation\" but omits the dictionary term \"地位\" (position, standing, etc.), which could be more precisely rendered as \"standing\" or \"role.\"\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly translates \"結算系統\" as \"Central Moneymarkets Unit settlement system\" instead of \"settlement system.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"northbound trading under the 'Bond Connect' scheme\" which is slightly wordy and less direct than \"Northbound 'Bond Connect' transactions.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"surpassing\" instead of \"exceeding,\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n- **Translation 5** includes \"for transaction data\" which is redundant and not present in the original text.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"underpins\" which is a strong and appropriate verb, but \"central securities settlement system\" is not the exact term used in the dictionary for \"CMU系統.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"status\" for \"地位\" as it aligns with the context of \"international financial centre.\"\n- \"Exceeding\" is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"surpassing.\"\n- \"Settlement system\" is the correct term for \"結算系統\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"Bond Connect\" should be in quotes and capitalized as it is a proper noun.\n- \"Mainland China\" should be used consistently for clarity.\n- \"Holding debt securities on behalf of\" is more precise than \"to hold.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. In 2018, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Instruments Central Settlement System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Data Repository achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities custody institutions in Mainland China, the CMU system continued to assist in settling Northbound \"Bond Connect\" transactions, as well as holding Mainland China debt securities on behalf of related CMU system members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), bringing the number of designated retail payment systems under HKMA supervision to six. The HKMA also oversees 16 licensed stored value facility operators. These licensees are actively launching new products and services, committed to providing customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the coverage of electronic cheques and electronic bill and payment services has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\nThe original text is a title: \"# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\". The goal is to translate it into a natural and fluent English title.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. \"Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\" – This translation is grammatically correct and fluent. However, it uses \"a fintech hub in Asia\" which is slightly less direct than \"Asia's fintech hub.\" The use of \"fintech\" is appropriate, but the title could be more concise.\n2. \"Hong Kong as Asia's financial technology hub.\" – This is accurate and uses \"financial technology\" as a full term. However, \"financial technology\" is more verbose than the commonly used term \"fintech,\" which is more concise and widely recognized in the industry.\n3. \"Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\" – This is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"Fintech\" with a capital \"F\" and \"Hub\" with a capital \"H,\" which is appropriate for a title. However, the capitalization may be too strict for a title that is not a proper noun.\n4. \"# Hong Kong as Asia's FinTech Hub\" – This translation is very close to the best possible version. It includes the hashtag, which matches the original text, and uses \"FinTech\" with a capital \"F\" and \"T.\" However, the capitalization may be too strict for a title that is not a proper noun.\n5. \"Hong Kong as Asia's fintech hub\" – This is a very good translation. It is concise, uses the correct term \"fintech,\" and is grammatically correct. The only minor issue is that it does not capitalize \"Hub\" as it would in a title, but this is a matter of style rather than correctness.\n6. \"# Hong Kong as Asia's fintech hub\" – This is the best of the translations provided. It includes the hashtag, uses the correct term \"fintech,\" and is concise and fluent. The only minor issue is that \"hub\" is not capitalized, but this is a matter of style rather than correctness.\nReasoning for the best possible translation:\nThe original text is a title, and titles often use a mix of capitalization and concise language. The term \"fintech\" is the most appropriate and concise term for \"金融科技\" in this context. The phrase \"Asia's fintech hub\" is the most direct and natural translation of \"亞洲的金融科技樞紐.\" The hashtag \"#\" is included to match the original text. The word \"Hub\" should be capitalized as it is a noun and part of the title.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is: \"Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub.\"\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" consistently and translating \"推動智慧銀行\" as \"promote smart banking.\" However, \"enhance to a higher level\" is slightly awkward; \"advance to a higher level\" or \"elevate to a higher level\" would be more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"published\" for \"公布\" instead of \"announced,\" which is less precise in this context. Also, \"which is to assist\" is awkward phrasing. The use of \"combination\" for \"結合\" is acceptable, but \"sizeable\" for \"龐大\" is slightly less impactful than \"vast.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"Smart banks\" instead of \"smart banking,\" which misrepresents the term. Also, \"banks and technology\" instead of \"banking and technology\" is incorrect. The phrase \"for Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem transformation\" is awkward and grammatically incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is one of the strongest translations. It uses \"announced\" for \"公布,\" \"advancing to a higher level\" for \"提升至更高層次,\" and \"seizing the significant opportunities\" for \"把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇.\" The structure is fluent and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"elevating to a higher level\" and \"vast opportunities,\" which are both strong choices. However, \"within the year\" at the end is slightly awkward compared to \"during the year.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most polished translation. It uses \"advancing to a higher level,\" \"vast opportunities,\" and \"facilitating the transformation of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\" The use of \"HKMA\" consistently and the phrase \"brought about by\" is more natural than \"brought by.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- \"Announced\" is more appropriate than \"published\" for \"公布.\"\n- \"Smart banking\" is the correct term, not \"Smart banks.\"\n- \"Advancing to a higher level\" or \"elevating to a higher level\" is more natural than \"enhance to a higher level.\"\n- \"Vast opportunities\" is more impactful than \"sizeable opportunities.\"\n- \"During the year\" is more natural than \"within the year.\"\n- \"Facilitating the transformation\" is more precise than \"transforming.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fourth and sixth translations, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\n**Final Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aimed at assisting the banking sector in advancing to a higher level and seizing the vast opportunities brought about by the integration of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress during the year in implementing these measures and facilitating the transformation of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# \"Faster Payment System\"\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\nThe original text discusses the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September, which allows users of banks and stored value payment tools to make real-time cross-bank transfers in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi using just a recipient's mobile number or email address. It also notes that 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, offering real-time payment and account binding services.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terms like \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"real-time payment services.\" However, \"provide customers with real-time payment services\" could be more precise as \"provide customers with real-time payment and account binding services.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"make instant cross-bank fund transfers\" and \"instant payment services,\" which are appropriate. However, the phrase \"users only needing to input\" is slightly awkward compared to \"users only need to input.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is concise and accurate. However, \"real-time inter-bank transfers\" is slightly less specific than \"real-time cross-bank fund transfers.\" Also, the sentence structure is a bit fragmented.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"inter-bank real-time fund transfers\" and \"real-time payment services,\" which are appropriate. However, \"banking and stored value payment tool users\" is slightly off compared to \"bank and stored value payment tool users.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate but has some grammatical issues, such as \"facilitating access for bank and Stored Value payment tool users to conduct...\" which is awkward. Also, \"accounts binding services\" should be \"account binding services.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is accurate but has some awkward phrasing, such as \"facilitating access for bank and Stored Value facility users\" and \"fund transfer of Hong Kong dollar and renminbi across banks in real time.\" Also, \"Stored Value facility\" is not the best term to use here.\n**Improved Translation:**\n\"The Faster Payment System (FPS) was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored value payment tool users to conduct real-time cross-bank fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi anytime and anywhere, by simply entering the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with real-time payment services and\/or account binding services.\"\n\n\"轉數快\"在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"HK dollars.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"200萬個登記\" as \"2 million registrations\" instead of \"20 million.\" Also, \"1,049億港元\" is mistranslated as \"104.9 billion\" instead of \"1,049 billion.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and \"HK dollars.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"200萬個登記\" as \"200 million\" instead of \"20 million.\" Also, \"480萬宗交易\" is mistranslated as \"480 million\" instead of \"4.8 million.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"FPS\" and \"renminbi.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"200萬個登記\" as \"20 million\" instead of \"20 million.\" Also, \"480萬宗交易\" is mistranslated as \"4.8 million\" instead of \"4.8 million.\" The translation is otherwise fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and \"RMB.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Grammatical error: \"have already received\" should be \"has already received.\" Also, \"3.5 month(s)\" is awkwardly phrased. \"Relative to Hong Kong’s population proportion of 27%\" is awkward and unclear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"FPS\" and \"HKD.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"200萬個登記\" as \"2 million\" instead of \"20 million.\" Also, \"1,049億港元\" is mistranslated as \"104.9 billion\" instead of \"1,049 billion.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and \"renminbi.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Grammatical errors: \"have been by well above 2 million registrations\" is ungrammatical. \"Since launched\" should be \"since its launch.\" Also, \"1,049億港元\" is mistranslated as \"104.9 billion\" instead of \"1,049 billion.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe correct translation of \"200萬個登記\" is \"20 million registrations,\" not \"2 million\" or \"200 million.\" Similarly, \"480萬宗交易\" should be \"4.8 million transactions,\" not \"4.8 million\" or \"480 million.\" \"1,049億港元\" is \"1,049 billion Hong Kong dollars,\" not \"104.9 billion.\" \"27.5億元人民幣\" is \"27.5 billion renminbi,\" not \"2.75 billion.\"\nThe phrase \"相對香港人口比例27%\" should be translated as \"relative to 27% of Hong Kong's population\" or \"accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population.\"\nThe system name \"轉數快\" should be translated as \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" as per the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\n\"Faster Payment System (FPS) has already received over 20 million registrations within 3.5 months, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total amount exceeding 1,049 billion Hong Kong dollars and 27.5 billion renminbi.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Common QR Code Standard and the related mobile application \"HKQR\" in the same month. It is the world's first mobile application that integrates multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, making it convenient for merchants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to accept payment schemes from different payment service providers using a single QR code, without needing to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface (API)\n\nOpen API refers to opening up banks' relevant data to third-party service providers, thereby enabling better and more convenient integration of banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment through a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open API framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based principle and implements various Open API functions in four phases. As of the end of January 2019, 20 banks had already opened approximately 500 Open API interfaces in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Technology Research and Talent Training\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of the dictionary terms. It correctly uses \"eTradeConnect\" for \"聯動\" and \"Memorandum of Understanding\" for \"備忘錄.\" The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has some grammatical errors, such as \"The platform are aimed at...\" which should be \"The platform is aimed at...\" It also uses \"connecting the two platforms’ concept verification\" which is awkwardly phrased. The term \"Monetary Authority of Singapore\" is correct, but \"Singapore Monetary Authority\" is also acceptable.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some issues. It uses \"Minimise risk of errors\" instead of \"minimise the risk of errors,\" which is slightly awkward. It also uses \"TradeLink\" instead of \"eTradeConnect,\" which is incorrect based on the dictionary. The phrase \"conduct connecting the two platforms proof-of-concept\" is grammatically incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first one but incorrectly uses \"TradeLink\" instead of \"eTradeConnect.\" It also uses \"Singapore's Monetary Authority\" which is acceptable but not the most standard term.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"eTradeConnect\" and \"Memorandum of Understanding.\" The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed. It also uses \"Global Trade Connectivity Network\" correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"Global Trade Connect Network\" instead of \"Global Trade Connectivity Network,\" which is slightly different from the dictionary entry. It also uses \"both platforms\" instead of \"the two platforms,\" which is acceptable but less precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the exact terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the structure and meaning of the original text. Based on the above review, the first and fifth translations are the most accurate and fluent. However, the first translation has a minor issue with the term \"TradeLink\" instead of \"eTradeConnect\" in the fourth translation. The fifth translation is the most accurate in terms of both dictionary usage and fluency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nBased on the review and reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nBased on the proof-of-concept results of the trade finance initiative led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), a consortium of multiple Hong Kong banks launched the trade finance platform \"eTradeConnect\" in October, which is built on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. As of the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined as members of the consortium. In October, \"eTradeConnect\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a proof-of-concept for connecting the two platforms. The HKMA is also simultaneously exploring opportunities for \"eTradeConnect\" to connect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connectivity Network.\"\n\nMr. Norman Chan, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), at the eTradeConnect launch ceremony.\n\nTo nurture more fintech specialists, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January to launch the upgraded version of the \"Fintech Talent Development Programme\" (FCAS 2.0). FCAS 2.0 comprises four initiatives, suitable for young talents at different stages of their career development. Over 200 students have benefited from the programme.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from left), attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony alongside Dr. Lin Jia-li, Chairman of Digital Harbour (first from left), Mr. Wang Ming-xin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (second from right), and Mr. Huang Ke-qiang, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Science Park Company (first from right).\n\n# Cross-border collaboration.\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 跨境合作\". The dictionary provides translations for \"合作\" and \"跨境\", with \"合作\" having multiple options and \"跨境\" being fixed as \"cross-border\".\nReview of the junior translations:\n1. \"Cross-border collaboration.\" – This is correct and concise, but lacks the hashtag and capitalization used in the original.\n2. \"# Cross-border Collaboration\" – This preserves the hashtag and capitalizes \"Collaboration\", which is appropriate for a heading.\n3. \"Cross-border collaboration\" – Identical to the first translation, missing the hashtag and capitalization.\n4. \"Cross-Border Collaboration\" – Uses \"Cross-Border\" with a hyphen and capitalizes \"Collaboration\", which is stylistically consistent with formal headings.\n5. \"# cross-border collaboration\" – Preserves the hashtag but uses lowercase for \"cross-border collaboration\", which is less formal and inconsistent with the original's capitalization.\n6. \"Cross-border Collaboration\" – Correctly capitalizes \"Collaboration\" but omits the hashtag.\nReasoning for improvement: The original text includes a hashtag (#), which is commonly used in headings or titles to denote a section or topic. The term \"跨境合作\" should be translated as \"cross-border collaboration\", with \"collaboration\" being the most natural and commonly used term in this context. The capitalization of \"Collaboration\" is appropriate for a heading, and the hashtag should be preserved to maintain the original format.\nBest possible translation: \"# Cross-Border Collaboration\" – This version includes the hashtag, uses the correct translation for \"跨境合作\", and capitalizes \"Collaboration\" appropriately for a heading.\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government Financial Development and Services Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to strengthen its collaboration with Shenzhen in the field of financial technology. This included the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's sponsorship of the \"Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme,\" allowing 50 students to undertake a six-week internship at multiple well-known companies in Shenzhen, experiencing the local fintech ecosystem; and jointly co-organising the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Awards\" for the second time with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), spoke with the first batch of Shenzhen fintech summer interns.\n\nThe Monetary Authority also signed a fintech cooperation agreement with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018, to promote fintech collaboration.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" programme. The network aims to provide innovative companies with more effective means to interact with regulatory authorities and to promote collaboration between regulatory authorities on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Banking\nThe original text is \"# 虛擬銀行,\" which translates to \"Virtual Banking\" when considering the dictionary provided. The dictionary lists \"virtual\" as an acceptable translation for \"虛擬\" and \"banking\" as an appropriate translation for \"銀行.\" The use of \"Banking\" in this context is more appropriate than \"bank\" because \"銀行\" refers to the broader concept of banking services, not just a single bank entity. Additionally, the use of a hashtag (#) in the original text suggests that this is likely a title or heading, which is preserved in the translation. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in their use of \"bank\" versus \"banking,\" with some using \"Virtual Bank\" and others using \"Virtual Banking.\" However, \"Virtual Banking\" is the most accurate and natural translation of \"虛擬銀行\" given the dictionary options and the context of the term as a heading or title. Therefore, \"Virtual Banking\" is the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nIntroducing virtual banks is expected to add new momentum to the application of financial technology in Hong Kong and bring new experiences to digital banking customers. Virtual banks target retail customers, including individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus also help promote inclusive finance. After public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the revised guideline \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May, and received about 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nThe usage of the sandbox has been steadily increasing during the year. To assist in establishing an ecosystem for financial compliance technology, the sandbox was opened to financial compliance technology projects starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved to use the sandbox for testing, of which 28 had completed the trial and the relevant products had also been launched into the market thereafter. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority had also received 220 cases requesting the use of the \"Fintech Regulatory Chatroom,\" hoping to obtain regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech project conception. Approximately 70% of these cases came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Global stock markets generally declined, and U.S. Treasury yields also rose along with the four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. With rising U.S. interest rates, the dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe political and economic pressures domestically, resulting in significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the delegated powers.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms from the dictionary and translated them appropriately. The term \"基金\" has been translated as \"Fund,\" and \"管理\" as \"management,\" while \"外匯\" has been translated as \"Exchange Fund.\" However, there are some minor issues with the translations provided.\nThe first, second, third, sixth, and seventh translations are all essentially the same: \"Management of the Exchange Fund.\" These translations are accurate and fluent, but they lack the formatting present in the original text, which includes a hashtag (#) at the beginning. The fourth and fifth translations include the hashtag, which is consistent with the original text's formatting.\nThe best possible translation would be to retain the hashtag from the original text and use the most accurate and fluent translation of the key terms. Therefore, the improved translation would be: \"# Management of the Exchange Fund.\"\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1:**  \n   *\"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Exchange Fund\" and \"investment objectives.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Establishes\" is a valid translation of \"制定,\" but \"for the Exchange Fund\" is redundant since the subject and object are the same. Also, the sentence lacks a verb for \"為\" (for\/to), which is better rendered as \"to\" or \"for.\"\n2. **Translation 2:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"sets\" for \"制定,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same redundancy issue as Translation 1. Also, \"sets\" is less formal than \"formulates\" or \"specifies.\"\n3. **Translation 3:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Formulates\" is a strong and formal translation of \"制定.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, the redundancy issue remains. Also, \"for the Exchange Fund\" is unnecessary.\n4. **Translation 4:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as Translation 2.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issues with redundancy and verb choice.\n5. **Translation 5:**  \n   *\"The Advisory Committee on the Foreign Exchange Fund formulates the following investment objectives for the foreign exchange fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"formulates\" and \"foreign exchange fund\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Advisory Committee on the Foreign Exchange Fund\" is not the most natural phrasing. Also, \"foreign exchange fund\" is not the exact match for \"外匯基金\" (which is better as \"Exchange Fund\").\n6. **Translation 6:**  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"has set\" for \"制定,\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The redundancy issue persists, and \"has set\" is less formal than \"formulates\" or \"specifies.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **\"制定\"** should be translated as **\"formulates\"** or **\"specifies\"** to reflect the formal and deliberate nature of the action.\n- **\"為\"** should be translated as **\"for\"** or **\"to\"** depending on context. In this case, \"for\" is more appropriate.\n- **\"外匯基金\"** should be translated as **\"Exchange Fund\"** as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase **\"for the Exchange Fund\"** is redundant and should be omitted to avoid repetition.\n- The structure should be concise and formal, as it is a statement from an official committee.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives:\n\n(a) Protect capital;  \n(b) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) Ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) Strive to achieve investment returns, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about how certain objectives align with the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and asset allocation. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"comprehensively take full account of\" which is slightly redundant. \"Comprehensively\" and \"take full account of\" both imply thoroughness, making the sentence wordy. However, the translation is grammatically correct and uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Simplifies the language by removing \"comprehensively\" and uses \"take full account of\" effectively. The sentence is concise and fluent, though it omits \"target\" before \"asset allocation,\" which may slightly weaken the nuance of the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"fully take into account\" instead of \"take full account of.\" While both are correct, \"take full account of\" is more idiomatic in formal writing. The use of \"target\" before \"asset allocation\" is appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Exchange Fund’s\" consistently and includes \"already,\" which aligns with the original's \"已.\" This translation is fluent and precise, though \"already\" may be slightly more emphatic than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Combines the strengths of translations 2 and 3. It uses \"take full account of\" and includes \"target\" before \"asset allocation,\" making it both accurate and fluent. It also avoids redundancy and maintains a formal tone.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Contains an error: \"objectives of asset allocation\" is incorrect. The original refers to \"目標資產配置,\" which should be \"target asset allocation,\" not \"objectives of asset allocation.\" This is a significant misinterpretation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"take full account of\" as per the dictionary.\n- Include \"target\" before \"asset allocation\" to reflect the original's nuance.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Avoid redundancy and maintain a formal, fluent tone.\n- Correctly use \"already\" or \"have been\" as appropriate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe above objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Exchange Fund\" and use \"portfolios\" for \"組合.\"\n- The term \"Currency Board\" is consistently used for \"發行局,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"US dollar-denominated assets\" is accurately used for \"美元資產.\"\n- The term \"monetary base\" is correctly used for \"貨幣基礎.\"\n- The phrase \"Economic Cooperation and Development Organization\" is used in several translations, which is the most accurate and complete version of \"經濟合作與發展組織.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"support portfolio\" and \"investment portfolio\" with lowercase \"p,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Portfolio\" (capitalized).\n- The term \"providing full backing\" is used in some translations, but \"provide full support\" is more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system\" is more natural than \"as required under the Currency Board system.\"\n- Some translations use \"Economic organisation for collaboration and development,\" which is not a standard name and is not in the dictionary.\n- The term \"safeguard\" is preferred over \"protect\" for \"保障\" in formal contexts.\n- The phrase \"member countries of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization\" is more precise than \"member countries of the Economic Cooperation and Development.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Portfolio\" with a capital \"P\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"provide full support\" for \"支持\" in the context of the Monetary Base.\n- Use \"in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use the full and correct name \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" (OECD) for \"經濟合作與發展組織.\"\n- Use \"safeguard\" for \"保障\" to reflect the formal tone of the text.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and proper capitalization.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the requirements of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts a prudent and incremental approach to diversify part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus, plus the total amount of future Fund and Exchange Fund subsidiary deposits linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund's accounts. Owing to the unique nature of this portfolio, the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Future Fund.\" The phrase \"approximately 50:50\" is correctly used. However, \"with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund\" could be more precise, as the original text specifies that the Future Fund is the exception.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. The use of \"portfolio composition\" is slightly less precise than \"portfolio proportion\" or \"portfolio weighting.\" The phrase \"the Future Fund's proportion\" is well-chosen.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has some grammatical issues, such as \"the Government, Funds and statutory organizations\" which is awkwardly phrased. Also, \"mainly excludes the future Fund\" is incorrect in meaning and grammar. The use of \"future Fund\" with lowercase \"f\" is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Fund\" entries.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The phrase \"primarily excluding the Future Fund\" is a good choice. The use of \"portfolio's proportion\" is slightly awkward, but overall, the translation is strong.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very fluent and accurate. The use of \"with the Future Fund being the main exception\" is a natural phrasing. The term \"portfolio weighting\" is appropriate. The phrase \"at the end of 2018\" is correctly used.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"weightings of the portfolios\" is slightly more complex than necessary, but still correct. The phrase \"the Financial Reserves\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it refers to a specific entity.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"Fund\" should be capitalized consistently as per the dictionary, especially when referring to specific entities like \"Future Fund.\"\n- The phrase \"approximately 50:50\" is appropriate, but \"around 50:50\" or \"about 50:50\" could also be used.\n- The term \"portfolio proportion\" or \"portfolio weighting\" is more precise than \"portfolio composition.\"\n- The phrase \"with the Future Fund being the main exception\" is more natural than \"except for the Future Fund.\"\n- The use of \"at the end of 2018\" is correct, but \"by the end of 2018\" is also acceptable.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally receives deposits from financial reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, with the Future Fund being the main exception. The interest rate on deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio weighting. By the end of 2018, the proportion of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe original text discusses the investment procedures of the Exchange Fund, focusing on strategic and tactical asset allocation, benchmarking, and the role of the Financial Secretary and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Generally accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" for the respective terms and accurately translates \"tracking error limits.\" However, it uses \"tactical deviation\" instead of \"strategic deviation,\" which is incorrect based on the original text.\n2. **Second Translation:** Similar to the first, but it uses \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation,\" which is correct. However, it uses \"strategic asset allocation\" twice, which may be redundant. It also uses \"short-term market movements\" instead of \"short-term market fluctuations,\" which is slightly less precise.\n3. **Third Translation:** Contains a critical error by repeating \"strategic asset allocation\" instead of \"tactical asset allocation.\" It also uses \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation,\" which is incorrect. The term \"strategic deviation\" is not supported by the original text.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"Strategic asset allocation\" with a capital \"S,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"Guideline\" with a capital \"G,\" which is unnecessary. The phrase \"Advisory consultation\" is awkward and not standard.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Correctly uses \"tactical deviation\" and \"strategic asset allocation.\" It is fluent and accurate, though it uses \"configuration\" instead of \"allocation\" in one instance, which is slightly off.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"tactical deviation\" and \"strategic asset allocation\" correctly. It is fluent and accurate, though it uses \"strategic asset allocation\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" in a slightly different order than the original.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"strategic asset allocation\" and \"tactical asset allocation\" correctly.\n- Use \"tactical deviation\" as the correct term.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology.\n- Maintain fluency and natural English phrasing.\n- Adhere to the dictionary terms, especially for \"司長\" (Financial Secretary), \"基金\" (Fund), and \"經理\" (portfolio managers).\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the allocation reflected in the investment benchmark, showing the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund may adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline to conduct tactical asset allocation in order to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, formulates the investment benchmark and sets the tracking error limit. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers may select positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\nThe original text is a single term, \"直接投資,\" which translates to \"direct investment.\" The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for \"投資,\" including \"investment,\" \"investments,\" \"investment spending,\" \"investing,\" \"invest,\" \"invested,\" and \"investors.\" However, in this context, \"direct investment\" is the most precise and commonly used term in both financial and economic discourse.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **\"Direct Investment\"** – This is correct and follows standard usage. The capitalization is appropriate if it is being used as a heading or title.\n2. **\"# Direct Investment\"** – The use of the hashtag is unnecessary unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform. It does not add value in a formal or academic context.\n3. **Same as #2** – Identical to the second translation, with the same issue regarding the hashtag.\n4. **\"investment\"** – This is a valid translation but lacks the specificity of \"direct investment.\" It is too general and does not capture the nuance of the original term.\n5. **\"Direct investment\"** – This is correct and natural. The lowercase \"investment\" is appropriate in most contexts unless it is a title or heading.\n6. **Same as #2** – Again, the hashtag is unnecessary and does not enhance the translation.\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation of \"直接投資\" is \"Direct Investment\" when used as a heading or title, or \"direct investment\" in a general context. The use of a hashtag is not appropriate here, as it is not part of the original text and does not serve a functional purpose in this context. The term \"direct investment\" is widely recognized in financial and economic literature, making it the most suitable choice.\n**Final Translation:**\nDirect Investment\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong established the Exchange Fund Investment Office in August to house investment and related risk management functions. The office's members are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio is invested in global fixed income markets, and the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy is executed through derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n# 外聘投資經理\nExternal Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, in order to achieve sustainable returns and enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gain insights and expertise in professional investment techniques.\n\nThe original text discusses the expenses associated with hiring external investment managers, specifying that these include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. It also notes that these expenses vary annually due to market factors.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"related expenses\" and \"varied from year to year\" effectively. However, \"varied from year to year\" is slightly less natural than \"vary each year.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Fund management\" with a capital \"F\" is inconsistent with the dictionary, which lists \"fund\" as a lowercase noun. Also, \"trading transactions\" is redundant and awkward. The phrase \"principally affected by market factors\" is correct, but the overall structure is slightly less fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"withholding tax\" correctly and \"vary each year\" naturally. However, it uses \"mainly affected by market factors\" which is slightly less precise than \"primarily due to market factors.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"expenses related to hiring external investment managers\" accurately, and \"withholding taxes\" is correctly pluralized. The phrase \"vary each year\" is natural, and \"mainly affected by market factors\" is clear and concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is excellent. It uses \"expenditures\" instead of \"expenses,\" which is a slight variation but still correct. The phrase \"primarily due to market factors\" is more precise than \"mainly affected by market factors.\" The structure is fluent and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a grammatical error: \"are mainly affecting by market factors\" is incorrect. It should be \"are mainly affected by market factors.\" Also, \"transactions fees\" is incorrect; it should be \"transaction fees.\" The use of \"portfolio managers\" is acceptable, but the overall translation is less polished.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"expenses related to hiring external investment managers,\" include \"fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes,\" and conclude with \"These expenses vary each year primarily due to market factors.\" This version is grammatically correct, fluent, and accurately reflects the original meaning.\n**Improved Translation:**\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary each year primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has enhanced its risk assessment to support the growing diversification of the Exchange Fund's investments; it also adopts risk control tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts a detailed analysis of investment performance factors to identify the sources of different performance outcomes, thereby evaluating how to fully utilize the investment management capabilities of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"Securities and Futures Commission\" for \"證券及期貨事務監察委員會\" and \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\" However, some translations use \"Investors\" with a capital \"I\" inconsistently, which should be lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some use awkward phrasing, such as \"the selection, appointment, and oversight processes of external fund managers\" (Translation 1) versus \"the selection, appointment, and oversight procedures of externally appointed portfolio managers\" (Translation 2). The latter is more natural.\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The use of \"ESG\" (Environmental, Social, and Governance) is a good choice in some translations (e.g., Translation 3 and 5), but not all translations use it consistently. The dictionary provides \"environment, social, and governance factors,\" so using \"ESG\" is acceptable but not mandatory.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n5. **Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"adopted\" for \"採納,\" \"principles\" for \"原則,\" and \"non-profit organization\" for \"非牟利組織.\" However, some translations use \"portfolio managers\" instead of \"fund managers,\" which is also acceptable but not strictly required by the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, consistent with the dictionary, and use appropriate financial terminology. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text and ensure that all dictionary terms are correctly translated. Based on the above review, the best translation would combine the strengths of the various translations, ensuring consistency in terminology, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to assist investors in determining the best approach to fulfilling their ownership responsibilities in investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, applicable to the selection, appointment, and oversight procedures of externally appointed fund managers. Fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must comply with the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" when managing such investments. Overall, the HKMA has incorporated environmental, social, and governance factors into its internal procedures for investment and related oversight activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of relevant ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into investment processes. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term objectives.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The original text is \"# 2018年的金融市場,\" which translates to \"The financial market in 2018\" or \"2018 Financial Markets.\" The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for \"金融\" (financial, fintech, finance, Financial, financing) and \"市場\" (market, exchange market, markets, Market). The term \"2018年\" is straightforward and should be translated as \"2018.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"The financial markets in 2018.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and natural-sounding.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"markets\" in plural, which may not match the original text's singular \"市場.\"  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** \"金融\" is translated as \"financial,\" and \"市場\" as \"markets.\" This is acceptable but not the most precise.\n2. **\"# 2018 financial market\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct year and term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is retained, which may be appropriate depending on context, but the use of lowercase \"financial market\" is less formal.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct use of \"financial\" and \"market.\"\n3. **\"# 2018 Financial Markets\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Proper capitalization and use of the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Markets\" in plural, which may not align with the original singular \"市場.\"  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct use of \"Financial\" and \"Markets.\"\n4. **\"# 2018 financial market\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as translation 2.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as translation 2.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct.\n5. **\"The financial market in 2018.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct use of \"financial\" and \"market.\"\n6. **\"# 2018 Financial Market\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Proper capitalization and use of the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.  \n   - **Dictionary Compliance:** Correct use of \"Financial\" and \"Market.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe original text uses \"市場\" in singular, so \"market\" (singular) is more accurate than \"markets\" (plural). The use of \"financial\" is more appropriate than \"Finance\" or \"Financing\" in this context. The hashtag is retained as it appears in the original text. The phrase \"in 2018\" is more natural than \"2018's\" or \"of 2018.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\n# 2018 Financial Market\n\nIn 2018, several risk factors previously underestimated by the market emerged one by one, including the pace of US interest rate normalization, the impact of the US government's foreign trade policies and protectionism on global trade, as well as geopolitical risks, leading to significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Hang Seng Index\" and \"MSCI Global Index\" and accurately reflects the percentage declines. However, \"causing significant concerns among investors\" is slightly awkward compared to \"causing significant concern among investors.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has a grammatical error: \"US-China trade concerns significantly let investors very concerned\" is ungrammatical and awkward. It also uses \"fluctuated and declined\" redundantly. The use of \"double-digit declines\" is correct, but the sentence structure is less fluent than other translations.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate, using \"fallen\" and \"fell\" appropriately. However, it uses \"markets\" instead of \"stock markets\" in one instance, which may be less precise. It also omits the word \"stocks\" in \"developed countries,\" which is slightly less specific than the dictionary's \"developed market stocks.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very fluent and accurate. It uses \"escalation\" and \"significant concerns\" effectively. The phrase \"fluctuate downward\" is slightly awkward, but the rest of the translation is well-structured and adheres closely to the dictionary terms.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has a grammatical error in \"recorded double-digit losses\" (should be \"recording\"). It also uses \"Investors\" with a capital \"I\" inconsistently. The phrase \"since early January\" is slightly off from the original, which says \"since the end of January.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"developed country markets\" instead of \"developed market stocks,\" which is slightly less precise. It also uses \"declining\" instead of \"falling\" in one instance, which is acceptable but slightly less direct.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should use \"Hang Seng Index\" and \"MSCI Global Index\" with the correct capitalization and structure. It should also use \"developed market stocks\" as per the dictionary. The phrase \"since the end of January\" should be used rather than \"since early January.\" The verb \"falling\" is more direct than \"declining\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe escalation of the US-China trade dispute has caused significant concern among investors, leading emerging markets and Hong Kong's stock markets to fluctuate and decline since the end of January. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 27% from its high in that month. Since the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets have also sharply declined, recording double-digit losses. Overall in 2018, global stock markets generally declined, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market stocks, falling 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also falling 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, U.S. Treasury yields broadly rose during 2018. However, the bond market still experienced volatility throughout the year. For example, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities increased from about 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by the end of the year due to investors' concerns over U.S.-China trade disputes and a shift toward safer investments.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened during the year in tandem with US interest rate hikes. The US dollar index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and renminbi fell against the US dollar by about 5%. Additionally, some emerging markets experienced further currency depreciation due to domestic political instability and economic uncertainty. For example, the Argentine peso and Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30%, respectively, against the US dollar. In contrast, demand for safe-haven investments pushed the Japanese yen up 2.7% against the US dollar.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"HK$10.9 billion\" correctly, but incorrectly translates \"109億港元\" as \"HK$10.9 billion\" instead of \"HK$109 billion.\" It also uses \"among which included\" which is grammatically awkward. The term \"Exchange Fund\" is used consistently, and \"Strategic\" is capitalized appropriately.\n- **Translation 2** correctly uses \"109億港元\" as \"10.9 billion Hong Kong dollars,\" which is a critical error. It also uses \"strategic\" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Strategic\" or \"Strategy\" options. The term \"foreign exchange valuation\" is more precise than \"valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets.\"\n- **Translation 3** correctly uses \"109億港元\" as \"10.9 billion HKD,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"due to foreign exchange adjustments\" which is not in the original text. The term \"strategic\" is used in lowercase, and \"non-HKD\" is a good alternative to \"non-Hong Kong dollar.\"\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly translates \"109億港元\" as \"10.9 billion HKD\" and also misrepresents the figures for losses (e.g., \"HKD 2.07 billion\" instead of \"207億港元\"). It uses \"downward valuation adjustment\" which is not in the original text.\n- **Translation 5** correctly uses \"109億港元\" as \"HK$109 billion\" and \"207億港元\" as \"HK$20.7 billion,\" which is incorrect. It uses \"downward valuation adjustment\" which is not in the original text but is a reasonable paraphrase. \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" is capitalized appropriately.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly translates \"109億港元\" as \"HKD 10.9 billion\" and \"574億港元\" as \"HKD 574 billion,\" which is a major error. It also uses \"bond income\" instead of \"bond investment gains\" and \"holding subsidiaries\" instead of \"subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund's investment holding companies.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly use the dictionary terms, especially for \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund), \"策略性\" (strategic), \"債\" (bond), \"收益\" (gains), \"虧損\" (losses), \"港元\" (HKD), and \"估值\" (valuation).\n- Accurately represent the figures (e.g., \"109億港元\" = \"HK$109 billion\").\n- Use natural English phrasing and maintain consistency in terminology.\n- Avoid grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded HK$109 billion in investment income in 2018, which included HK$574 billion in gains from bond investments, HK$207 billion in losses from Hong Kong stock investments, HK$387 billion in losses from other stock investments, a HK$90 billion decrease in valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HK$219 billion in gains from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund's investment holding companies. On the other hand, the Strategic Asset Portfolio recorded a HK$5 billion decrease in valuation.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund's total assets amounted to HK$405.49 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$283.6 billion, among which private equity amounted to HK$191.1 billion and real estate was HK$92.5 billion. The total amount already committed but not yet drawn down for investment was HK$202.4 billion.\n\nThe original text discusses the performance of different investment portfolios of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and since 2009. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"strategic asset portfolio\" as per the dictionary. However, \"the portfolio's return rate at -2.4%\" is slightly awkward. Also, \"internal rate of return annualised\" should be \"annualised internal rate of return\" for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"annualised internal rate of return\" correctly and maintains a clear structure. However, \"the investment portfolio's return rate\" is slightly redundant since the context already refers to the portfolio.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation uses \"Strategic Portfolio\" instead of \"strategic asset portfolio,\" which is not fully aligned with the dictionary. Also, \"backing portfolios\" is not an accurate translation of \"支持組合\" (support portfolio). The phrase \"annualised rate\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"recorded a return of 0.3% on its investments\" and \"annualised internal rate of return\" correctly. The structure is clear and the language is natural. However, \"investment activities commenced\" is slightly wordy compared to \"commencement of investments.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is less fluent. It uses \"backed by 2.1%\" which is incorrect for \"支持組合\" (support portfolio). Also, \"annualised rate of return\" is repeated unnecessarily, and the sentence structure is awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a very strong translation. It uses \"annualised rate of internal return\" correctly and maintains a clear, professional tone. However, \"rate of internal return\" could be more naturally phrased as \"internal rate of return.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"strategic asset portfolio\" for \"策略性資產組合.\"\n- Use \"support portfolio\" for \"支持組合.\"\n- Use \"annualised internal rate of return\" for \"內部回報率年率.\"\n- Maintain a clear and professional tone.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded a return of 0.3% on its investments in 2018, with the portfolio returning -2.4% and the support portfolio returning 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.9% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\nChart 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the investment return rate of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The average return rate of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 3.2%, over the past 5 years was 2.1%, over the past 10 years was 2.8%, and since 1994 has been 4.7%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2018.\n"}

2019年1月1日的主要人力資源數據\n\n# 2018年組織架構變動\n\n外匯基金投資辦公室於8月1日成立，取代過往由儲備管理部與風險管理及監察部負責的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的成立凸顯金管局的投資職能，提升其機構形象，並能更靈活應對市場的變化，以配合持續擴展及多元化的外匯基金投資工作。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表1 2019年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n負責監察投資風險的員工為外匯基金投資辦公室組織架構的一部分， 在此則歸納於風險管理及監察部以方便呈示其工作職能。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2018年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。\n2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。金管局高層人員人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁、處置機制辦公室專員及外匯基金投資辦公室首席營運官在內。\n3. 其他福利包括公積金或合約酬金（視情況而定）、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, and strengthening information technology security, to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close links with the media to enhance its transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the HKMA held a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-the-spot interviews, and 64 other public events. In addition, 39 media interviews were arranged during the year, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued, with a large number of media inquiries handled every day.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) principal functions, the HKMA hosts media briefings and executive workshops for local and overseas media, covering a variety of topics including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, Green Finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA also launched an official Facebook page in July, further utilizing social media to strengthen communication with the public.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), and the Environment Bureau's mascot \"Big Waste Ghost\" collaborated through social media to promote the use of \"New Year Banknotes\" for sealing lucky money envelopes.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe public inquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's principal functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 inquiries were handled, of which about half involved banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and banknotes and coins, especially the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, the Faster Payment System \"FPS,\" virtual banking, and the 2018 Hong Kong new series banknotes.\n\nChart 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Chart 2 lists the proportion accounted for by different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public inquiries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Punctuation and Formatting**: The second junior translator used a colon after \"Chart 1,\" which is a more standard format for titles in English, especially in formal or technical contexts. This improves readability and clarity.\n2. **Capitalization**: The first junior translator capitalized \"Total Number,\" which is acceptable but not strictly necessary unless it is part of a title case style. The third and fourth junior translators used \"Total number\" with only the first word capitalized, which is more natural in English for a title that is not in full title case.\n3. **Consistency with the Dictionary**: All translations correctly used \"Chart\" for \"圖\" and \"public inquiries\" for \"公眾查詢.\" The term \"Total number\" was used consistently, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"總數.\"\n4. **Fluency and Naturalness**: The translations are all fluent and natural, with no grammatical errors. However, the use of a colon in the second translation adds a slight improvement in structure.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would be to use the format with a colon, as it is more standard for such titles, and to maintain the lowercase \"total number\" for a more natural and less formal tone, unless the context requires full title case.\nChart 1: Total number of public inquiries\n\nChart 2: Inquiries Received in 2018 by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the Authority published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Currency and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report in 2018. It also regularly updated the data in the Monthly Financial Data Report, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong's currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the Authority published a total of 13 inSight articles, explaining multiple thematic issues related to its work.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides more than 60,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the HKMA. The website also contains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions,\" maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Instruments,\" maintained in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments Ordinance. The website features a dedicated topic webpage and prominent quick links to remind the public of the HKMA’s new measures, such as \"Faster Payment System (FPS),\" and important and timely matters, such as being cautious of telephone scams and the parking locations of cash collection vehicles under the Coin Collection Scheme.\n\nTo promote the implementation of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken the lead by launching open APIs on its website starting in July, facilitating public access to key information. The first batch of 50 sets of open API data was successfully rolled out in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking sector and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash-in-transit vehicle schedules. The remaining 80 sets of data will be rolled out in phases before mid-2019. To further facilitate the public's access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on the website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website's design and content to make it more user-friendly. The newly designed website is expected to be launched by the end of 2019.\n\nThe original sentence is: \"金管局身體力行，推動開放API的發展及應用。\" The dictionary provides specific translations for certain terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation. Here's a critical review and reasoning for the best possible translation:\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1 & 2:** \"The HKMA leads by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"HKMA\" (assuming it refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority), correct use of \"promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is not explicitly defined in the original text, though it is a known entity. The phrase \"leads by example\" is a good fit for \"身體力行,\" but it's not the only possible translation.\n2. **Translation 3:** \"The Financial Supervisory Authority is promoting the development and application of Open APIs.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"promoting the development and application of Open APIs.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" is not the correct name for \"金管局\" (which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, or HKMA). This is a factual error.\n3. **Translation 4:** \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is practicing what it preaches, promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Practicing what it preaches\" is a more idiomatic expression than \"身體力行,\" which is more about leading by example or setting an example through action.\n4. **Translation 5:** \"The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau leads by example, promoting the development and application of Open API.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"leads by example\" and \"promoting the development and application.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" is not the correct name for \"金管局.\" Also, \"Open API\" should be plural: \"Open APIs.\"\n5. **Translation 6:** \"The HKMA leads by example, promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and concise. Uses \"HKMA\" and \"promoting the development and application of open APIs.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"HKMA\" is not defined in the original text, though it is a known entity.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n- \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and accuracy.\n- \"身體力行\" is best translated as \"leads by example\" or \"practices what it preaches,\" but \"leads by example\" is more concise and commonly used.\n- \"推動\" is best translated as \"promoting\" in this context.\n- \"開放API的發展及應用\" should be translated as \"the development and application of open APIs.\" \"API\" should be plural: \"APIs.\"\n- \"發展\" is best translated as \"development\" in this context.\n- \"應用\" is best translated as \"application.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority leads by example, promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Programme\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms \"公眾\" and \"計劃\" and translated them as \"Public\" and \"Programme\" respectively. However, there are some minor issues with capitalization and formatting in their translations. The first, third, sixth, and seventh translations correctly use \"Public Education Programme\" with proper capitalization. The fourth and fifth translations use \"public education Programme\" with lowercase \"public\" and capital \"Programme,\" which is inconsistent. The second and sixth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which may be unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Public Education Programme\" with proper capitalization and without any unnecessary symbols. This translation accurately reflects the original Traditional Chinese text and adheres to English grammar and formatting conventions.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Financial Centre Phase 2, introducing the work of the HKMA and enhancing the public's understanding of currency and banking affairs. The Information Centre consists of two parts: an exhibition area and a library, which are open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA, as well as the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sectors; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Information Centre\" and \"currency section\" as key areas, using appropriate terms like \"Information Centre\" and \"currency section.\"\n- The term \"2018年\" is consistently translated as \"2018\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"遊戲\" is translated as \"games\" in all translations, which is correct.\n- The term \"紫荊樹\" is translated as \"Bauhinia tree\" in all translations, which is accurate.\n- The term \"展區\" is translated as \"section\" or \"exhibition area,\" which is acceptable, though \"currency section\" is more precise.\n- The term \"翻新\" is translated as \"renovation\" or \"refurbishment,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"硬幣\" is translated as \"coins\" in all translations, which is correct.\n- The term \"鈔票\" is translated as \"banknotes\" or \"notes,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"資訊\" is translated as \"Information\" or \"information,\" which is acceptable.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Currency Section\" with a capital \"C,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"currency\" (lowercase).\n- The term \"工程\" is translated as \"renovation project\" or \"refurbishment engineering,\" but the dictionary lists \"refurbishment\" as the best fit.\n- The term \"知識\" is translated as \"expertise\" in one translation, which is incorrect; \"knowledge\" is the correct term.\n- The term \"形象\" is translated as \"identity\" or \"design,\" but \"identity\" is more appropriate in context.\n- The term \"日\" is translated as \"day\" or \"dates,\" but \"day\" is more precise in the context of \"August 16.\"\n- The term \"新增\" is translated as \"added\" or \"has added,\" which is acceptable, but \"added\" is more direct.\n- The term \"相映成趣\" is translated as \"alongside\" or \"complementing,\" which is acceptable, but \"complementing\" is more natural in English.\n- The term \"翻新\" is translated as \"renovation\" or \"refurbishment,\" which is correct, but \"renovation\" is more commonly used in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent terminology, such as \"currency section\" and \"Information Centre.\"\n- Translate \"工程\" as \"refurbishment.\"\n- Use \"knowledge\" for \"知識.\"\n- Use \"identity\" for \"形象.\"\n- Use \"day\" for \"日.\"\n- Use \"added\" for \"新增.\"\n- Use \"complementing\" for \"相映成趣.\"\n- Use \"renovation\" for \"翻新.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe currency section of the Information Centre introduces the design, anti-counterfeiting features, production process, and other interesting knowledge about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. The section underwent refurbishment in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating multiple interactive elements, such as games that combine learning with fun, allowing visitors to gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency while also enjoying the experience. In addition, the currency section added a new artistic Bauhinia tree, made up of 2,018 transparent cubic blocks crafted from banknotes that are no longer suitable for circulation and have been shredded, complementing another mosaic artwork within the section made from Hong Kong coins. The currency section with its brand-new identity reopened on August 16.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of the dictionary terms. It uses \"commence full operation\" for \"啟用\" and \"Register of Authorized Institutions\" for the relevant term. However, it uses \"cumulative received\" which is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"maintains\" and \"as stipulated in\" effectively. It correctly translates \"認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊\" as \"Register of Authorized Institutions' Banking Staff.\" However, \"Banking Staff\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"證券業務員工.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some grammatical issues, such as \"This year\" instead of \"During the year\" and \"the cumulative total number of visitors to the Information Centre has exceeded 705,000.\" It also uses \"Approved Institutions\" instead of \"Authorized Institutions,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"Figure 3\" instead of \"Chart 3,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable. It also uses \"researching\" and \"as stipulated in\" effectively. However, \"Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has several errors, including \"December 1993\" instead of \"December 2003,\" \"provide more than 580 times of tours,\" and \"More than 705,000 people.\" It also uses \"record book\" instead of \"Register\" and \"Ordinance 20\" instead of \"Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\" These are significant deviations from the dictionary and the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"maintains\" and \"as stipulated in\" effectively. However, it uses \"Representatives' Offices\" instead of \"Representative Offices\" and \"Employees in Authorized Institutions' Securities Business\" instead of \"Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions.\" These are minor but noticeable differences.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"Chart 3\" consistently as in the original.\n- Use \"Authorized Institutions\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"commence full operation\" for \"啟用.\"\n- Ensure \"more than 705,000 visitors\" is used consistently.\n- Use \"maintains\" for \"備存.\"\n- Use \"as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance\" for \"規定.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre received more than 59,000 visitors and provided over 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Since its commencement of full operation in December 2003, the Information Centre has cumulatively received more than 705,000 visitors. The library adjacent to the exhibition area houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for the study of topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIntroduce the process of making Hong Kong banknotes through an interactive game.\n\nThe original sentence, \"藝術紫荊樹懸於半空，配以燈光效果，展現樹姿在不同季節的美態。\" describes an artistic Bauhinia tree suspended in mid-air, enhanced by lighting effects to showcase its beauty across different seasons. The dictionary provides specific translations for \"紫\" (Bauhinia), \"於\" (on, in, at, of, as, for), and \"效果\" (effect). The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"artistic Bauhinia tree\" and \"displaying the tree's posture in the beauty of different seasons.\" The term \"posture\" is awkward and not idiomatic in English. \"Beauty of different seasons\" is also awkwardly phrased.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"hangs on the air,\" which is ungrammatical. \"Complemented by lighting effects\" is correct, but \"showcasing its beauty in different seasons\" is more natural than \"posture.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Suspended in mid-air\" is more natural than \"hangs on the air.\" \"Showcasing the tree's beauty in different seasons\" is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Combined with a lighting effect\" uses \"a\" instead of \"lighting effects\" (plural), which is inconsistent with the original. \"Showcasing the beauty of its form across different seasons\" is more natural than \"posture.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Artificial Bauhinia trees\" misrepresents the original, which refers to \"artistic\" rather than \"artificial.\" \"Showcasing the beauty of the trees in different seasons\" is natural but lacks the nuance of \"form.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Bauhinia trees are suspended in mid-air\" is grammatically correct. \"Paired with lighting effect\" uses \"effect\" in singular, which is inconsistent with the original. \"Showcasing the beauty of the trees’ form in different seasons\" is natural but slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Bauhinia\" for \"紫\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"suspended in mid-air\" for \"懸於半空.\"\n- Use \"lighting effects\" (plural) for \"效果.\"\n- Use \"showcasing the beauty of its form across different seasons\" to capture the nuance of \"展現樹姿在不同季節的美態.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe artistic Bauhinia tree is suspended in mid-air, paired with lighting effects, showcasing the beauty of its form across different seasons.\n\nThe original sentence, \"資訊中心為學校及其他團體提供導賞服務。\" translates to \"The Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\" The junior translators have mostly produced accurate translations, but there are minor differences in style and structure that can be refined for fluency and formality.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1 and 4:** \"The Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Information Centre\" with the definite article \"The,\" which is appropriate in formal contexts. The verb \"provides\" is correctly used in the present tense. The term \"guided tours\" is an accurate translation of \"導賞.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Translation 2:** Same as Translation 1. No issues.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is accurate and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The omission of \"The\" before \"Information Centre\" makes it slightly less formal. In formal writing, it is more appropriate to use \"The Information Centre.\"\n4. **Translation 5 and 6:** Same as Translation 3. No issues beyond the omission of \"The.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nWhile all translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, the most natural and formal version would include the definite article \"The\" before \"Information Centre.\" This is standard in English when referring to a specific, named entity. Additionally, the use of \"provides\" is more natural than \"provide\" in this context, as the subject \"The Information Centre\" is singular.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nMiddle school students and teachers from different districts attended public education seminars.\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA held a total of three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, stability of the banking system, the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Faster Payment System (FPS), stored value payment tools, financial technology, consumer protection, and employment information in the financial sector. Since their launch in 1998, the education seminars have attracted nearly 60,000 teachers and students.\n\nChart 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"streamline,\" \"flexible,\" and \"cost-effectiveness.\" The only minor issue is the phrase \"to the extent possible,\" which is slightly wordy but acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"framework\" instead of \"structure\" for \"政府架構.\" It also uses \"streamlined\" instead of \"lean and flexible,\" which is slightly less precise. However, it is still a strong translation.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several errors. It incorrectly uses \"cost pressures\" instead of \"cost-effectiveness,\" and \"work issuance\" instead of \"workload.\" It also misuses \"adjustments of existing personnel\" instead of \"allocating existing staff.\" The sentence structure is awkward, and the translation is less fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation, with accurate use of terms from the dictionary. It uses \"Non-civil service terms\" correctly and \"streamlined\" appropriately. The only minor issue is the use of \"dedicates itself to\" instead of \"is committed to,\" which is slightly less formal but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"employs\" instead of \"hires,\" which is more formal and appropriate for the context. It also uses \"adjusting the existing workforce\" correctly, and the sentence structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation has several errors, including \"continued to streamline workflows\" instead of \"continuously streamlines,\" and \"enormous effort is put on maintaining\" instead of \"is committed to maintaining.\" It also uses \"work issuance\" incorrectly and has awkward phrasing.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the correct terms from the dictionary. It should avoid awkward phrasing and maintain a formal tone appropriate for a government institution. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, but it can be refined further for clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the government framework, but it employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialised knowledge. As a public institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continuously streamlines work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organisational structure and, as much as possible, implements new measures and copes with the increasing workload by adjusting the existing workforce.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an employer that provides equal employment opportunities and ensures that staff can work in an environment free from discrimination. The Authority's equal opportunity policy applies to appointment, compensation and benefits, performance evaluation, promotion, transfer\/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work requirements. The HKMA requires its staff to maintain high standards of conduct and ethics, adhering strictly to high personal behavioral and conduct standards at all times, and acting in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Main Human Resources Data for January 1, 2019\n\n# 2018 Organisational Structure Changes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserves Management Department and the Risk Management and Oversight Department. The establishment of the Exchange Fund Investment Office highlights the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's investment functions, enhances its institutional profile, and enables it to more flexibly respond to market changes, supporting the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund's investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the position establishment and actual number of staff members of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by department.\n\nTable 1: Position Establishment and Actual Number of Staff Members of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of 1 January 2019\n\nThe original text discusses the organizational structure of the Exchange Fund Investment Office, specifically the role of staff responsible for monitoring investment risks and how they are grouped under the Risk Management and Oversight Department for clarity in presenting their functions.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"is part of the Exchange Fund Investment Office's organizational structure\" uses \"is\" which may not be the best fit for a plural subject (\"staff\"). Also, \"categorized under\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Employees\" instead of \"Staff,\" which is acceptable but less formal. \"Consolidated under\" is a bit unclear in this context. The rest is accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"organisational\" with a British spelling, which is acceptable. \"Grouped under\" is a good choice. \"In order to present their work functions clearly\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Responsible for oversight of investment risk staff\" is awkwardly phrased. \"Organization framework\" is not the best match for \"架構.\" \"Summarized in the Department\" is unclear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"is part of the Exchange Fund Investment Office’s organisational structure\" with a British spelling, which is acceptable. \"Included in this document\" is not in the original text and adds unnecessary information.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"organisational\" with British spelling. \"Grouped under\" is appropriate. \"In this context\" is slightly vague but acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"staff\" as the subject, as it is more formal and matches the original.\n- Use \"organisational\" or \"organizational\" depending on regional preference, but maintain consistency.\n- Use \"grouped under\" or \"classified under\" to indicate categorization.\n- Use \"to facilitate the presentation of their functions\" or a similar phrase to convey the purpose clearly.\n- Avoid adding extra information not present in the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nStaff responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organisational structure of the Exchange Fund Investment Office and are grouped under the Risk Management and Oversight Department to facilitate the presentation of their functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is generally accurate but has some awkward phrasing, such as \"solicits feedback from its under governance Committee,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"remuneration portfolio\" instead of \"compensation package,\" which is less common in this context.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is more fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"obtain advice from the governance committee under his jurisdiction\" and \"references market salary levels and practices.\" However, \"practices\" is not in the dictionary, and \"practices\" should be \"arrangement\" as per the dictionary.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is less accurate. It uses \"heard advice from the Advisory Committee under its governance Committee,\" which is unclear. It also uses \"occupational retirement schemes\" instead of \"provident fund,\" which is not in the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"obtains opinions from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the governance committee under his jurisdiction\" and \"refers to market salary levels and arrangements.\" It is fluent and accurate, though \"disbursed once a year\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"listens to the opinions of the governance committees under its jurisdiction through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"refers to market compensation levels and arrangements.\" It also uses \"compensation package\" and \"employee performance,\" which are appropriate.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This is the most polished translation. It uses \"consults the opinions of the governance committees under its jurisdiction through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"refers to market compensation levels and arrangements.\" It also uses \"salary package,\" \"cash compensation,\" and \"variable pay based on employee performance, disbursed once a year in a lump sum,\" which are all natural and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe sixth translation is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms, such as \"Financial Secretary,\" \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"governance committees,\" \"market compensation levels and arrangements,\" \"provident fund,\" and \"disbursed once a year.\" It also uses natural English phrasing and avoids awkward constructions.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary consults the opinions of the governance committees under its jurisdiction through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and refers to market compensation levels and arrangements to decide on the salaries and service conditions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's staff. The salary package includes cash compensation and the provident fund, with additional basic benefits set up. Cash compensation includes a fixed monthly salary (i.e., base salary) and variable pay based on employee performance, disbursed once a year in a lump sum.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff annually through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, seeking recommendations from the Authority’s Governance Committee, and considers the Governance Committee’s assessment of the Authority’s performance over the past year, the results of a financial sector salary survey conducted by an independent human resources consultancy firm, and other relevant factors. Individual staff members with outstanding performance may also receive special adjustments to their salaries to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual staff performance; the variable compensation system for staff responsible for investments is aimed at strengthening the link between their investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed compensation and disbursement of variable compensation for staff at the level of Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee's opinion, and such staff will not attend meetings discussing their compensation proposals. For staff at the level of Director and below, adjustments to fixed compensation and disbursement of variable compensation are decided by the Governor of the HKMA, based on authorization from the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the approved lump sum funds for payment of salaries.\n\n# Senior Officers' Compensation\n\nTable 2 sets out the compensation data of senior officers in 2018.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual compensation received by employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual compensation for the relevant position.  \n2. The number of employees shown in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of senior officers at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Corporation Limited, the Commissioner of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Exchange Fund Investment Office.  \n3. Other benefits include the Mandatory Provident Fund or contract-based remuneration (depending on the situation), medical and life insurance, and accumulated annual leave during the year. These benefits may vary according to the service conditions of individual senior officers.\n"}

其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019

These financial statements include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2018, the income and expenditure accounts for the year ended on that date, the comprehensive income statements, the statements of changes in equity, and the cash flow statements, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of the principal accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and they present fairly and adequately the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2018, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit guidelines of the Audit Commission. The responsibilities I must bear in accordance with these guidelines are detailed in the section of this report titled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these guidelines, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in line with these guidelines. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is adequate and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Critical Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in the audit and formation of my opinion on the overall financial statements, and I will not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, “按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值,” translates to “Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value.” The junior translators have produced several variations, each with slight differences in prepositions and phrasing.\n- **Translation 1** uses “Carried at Fair Value,” which is a common term in accounting but slightly less precise than “Measured at Fair Value.”\n- **Translation 2** uses “accounted for at fair value,” which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** uses “measured at fair value,” which is the most technically accurate and commonly used in financial reporting.\n- **Translation 4** omits the preposition “for” after “accounted,” making it grammatically incorrect.\n- **Translation 5** repeats the capitalization of “Accounted for at Fair Value,” which is inconsistent with standard title capitalization.\n- **Translation 6** uses “Recorded at Fair Value,” which is acceptable but not as standard as “Measured at Fair Value.”\nThe best choice is to use “Measured at Fair Value,” as it is the most precise and standard term in financial accounting. Additionally, the use of “Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary terms provided. The title should be concise, grammatically correct, and use standard financial terminology.\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\n93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured at fair value, which is the quoted price in an active market for the identical asset or liability (Level 1 parameter), or are estimated using valuation methods, with the parameters used based on observable market data (Level 2 parameter).\n\nThe remaining 7% of the fair value of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total amount of these financial assets is HK$2,756.31 billion, mainly consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn view of the sizeable amounts involved and the estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe original text discusses audit procedures related to the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency and precision.\nTranslation 1 is concise and uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is a standard accounting term. However, it begins with \"Regarding,\" which is slightly informal for a professional context.\nTranslation 2 uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is also correct and commonly used in financial reporting. It begins with \"The audit procedures for,\" which is more formal and appropriate for a professional document.\nTranslation 3 uses \"recorded at fair value,\" which is less precise than \"measured at fair value\" in the context of financial instruments. It also uses \"the audit process includes,\" which is grammatically awkward and less formal than \"audit procedures include.\"\nTranslation 4 is identical to Translation 2 and is therefore equally strong.\nTranslation 5 uses \"carried at fair value,\" which is also a valid term but slightly less common than \"measured at fair value\" in this context.\nTranslation 6 is identical to Translation 1 and shares the same minor issue with the opening phrase.\nThe best approach is to use \"measured at fair value\" as it is the most standard and precise term in financial accounting. The phrase \"audit procedures for\" is more formal and appropriate for a professional context. The use of \"including\" at the end is correct and aligns with the original structure.\nThe final translation should be:\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including application monitoring measures related to computer systems;  \n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If market quotes are used, verify prices based on independent sources;  \n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is suitable and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investments in Property Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 20, and 21 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, amounting to HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in 3 associate companies and 20 joint ventures, whose principal business is holding overseas investment properties, with those interests amounting to HK$44.336 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or through associate or joint venture companies, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined by the valuations of independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associate or joint venture companies, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are some inconsistencies and areas for improvement. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"valuation reports,\" \"fair value,\" and \"valuers.\" The structure is clear and professional.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This is very similar to the first, with the only difference being \"competency\" instead of \"qualifications.\" Both are acceptable, but \"qualifications\" is more commonly used in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has some issues. It uses \"consolidated companies\" instead of \"joint venture companies,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"valuation approaches\" is less precise than \"valuation methods.\" The use of \"input(s)\" is acceptable but less standard than \"parameters.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"consolidated companies\" instead of \"joint venture companies,\" which is a mistake. However, it uses \"valuation approaches\" and \"input(s),\" which are acceptable but not the most standard terms.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"valuation professionals\" instead of \"valuers,\" which is slightly more formal but still correct. It also uses \"valuation methods\" and \"parameters,\" which are standard terms.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"valuation experts\" instead of \"valuers,\" which is slightly more formal but still correct. It also uses \"valuation methods\" and \"parameters,\" which are standard terms.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Valuers\" is the most standard term in this context.\n- \"Qualifications\" is more commonly used than \"competency\" or \"certification\" when referring to the credentials of a valuer.\n- \"Valuation methods\" is more standard than \"valuation approaches\" or \"valuation techniques.\"\n- \"Parameters\" is more standard than \"input(s)\" when referring to variables used in valuation models.\n- \"Joint venture companies\" is the correct term, not \"consolidated companies.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"valuers,\" \"qualifications,\" \"valuation methods,\" and \"parameters,\" and would correctly identify the entities as \"associate companies\" or \"joint venture companies.\"\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This information includes all the information in the Monetary Authority's 2018 Annual Report, but does not include financial statements or my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion regarding other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# The original text is a formal statement about the responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and these must be used exactly as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically incorrect and awkward. It misplaces \"responsibilities\" and uses \"Fund’s Fund’s,\" which is not a valid term from the dictionary. The structure is unclear and does not reflect the original meaning accurately.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is closer to the intended meaning but misplaces \"responsibility\" and uses \"Sub-Committee of\" incorrectly. It also omits the term \"Audit Committee\" and fails to clearly link the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct but misuses \"bears responsibility\" and incorrectly uses \"Fund’s Fund’s\" from the dictionary. It also fails to clearly indicate the relationship between the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is more fluent but still misplaces the term \"Audit Committee\" and uses \"have the responsibility\" instead of the more formal \"responsibility\" or \"responsibilities.\" It also omits the term \"Sub-Committee of\" from the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Authority\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" and misplaces the term \"responsibility.\" It also fails to use the correct term \"Sub-Committee of\" from the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Sub-Committee of\" from the dictionary and places \"responsibility\" appropriately. However, it could be improved by using \"Audit Committee\" more clearly and ensuring the structure reflects the original meaning more precisely.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly state that the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Monetary Authority are responsible for the financial statements. It should use the exact terms from the dictionary, maintain grammatical correctness, and ensure clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Monetary Authority regarding the financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing the internal controls that it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and in applicable circumstances, disclosing matters related to going concern, and using the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurately uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Audit Committee\" is correct, but the structure \"under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is slightly awkward. Also, \"Group's\" should be \"the Group's\" for consistency with the original.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Sub-Committee of audit is responsible for supervising the Group’s financial reports process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Sub-Committee of\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"financial reports process\" is ungrammatical. \"Reports\" should be singular \"report\" or \"reporting.\" Also, \"audit\" is used as a noun without a definite article.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the financial audit process of the group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"audit\" as a noun and \"financial audit process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"audit Committee\" should be capitalized as \"Audit Committee.\" Also, \"the group\" should be \"the Group\" for consistency.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Audit Committee\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The structure \"under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is incorrect. The original says the Audit Committee is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, not a sub-committee of it.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of the Group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct structure, proper use of \"financial reporting process,\" and \"Group\" with capitalization.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Slight awkwardness in \"the financial reporting process of the Group\" compared to \"the Group's financial reporting process.\"\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee, under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of the Group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Proper capitalization and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly places the Audit Committee under a \"Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which misrepresents the original sentence.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe original sentence structure is:  \n**[外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會] 負責 [監督集團的財務報告過程]**\n- \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" should be translated as **\"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\"** (from the dictionary: \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Advisory\").\n- \"轄下\" is best translated as **\"under\"** or **\"of\"** depending on context. Here, \"under\" is more natural.\n- \"審核委員會\" is **\"Audit Committee\"** (from the dictionary: \"audit\").\n- \"負責\" is best translated as **\"is responsible for\"** (from the dictionary: \"is responsible for\").\n- \"監督\" is best translated as **\"supervising\"** or **\"supervision\"**. \"Supervising\" is more active and natural in this context.\n- \"集團的財務報告過程\" should be **\"the Group's financial reporting process\"** (from the dictionary: \"Group\" and \"reporting process\").\n### Final Translation:\n**The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.**\n\n# The title \"審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\" translates to \"The responsibility of auditors in the audit of financial statements.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of this title, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"The responsibility of auditors for the audit of financial statements\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, \"for\" may not be the most precise preposition in this context; \"in\" is more commonly used when referring to the responsibility in relation to a process or task.\nTranslation 2: \"# Responsibility of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\" is well-structured and uses the correct preposition \"in.\" The use of a hashtag at the beginning may be appropriate if this is a section heading, but it is not necessary in a general translation.\nTranslation 3: \"The auditor's responsibility in the audit of financial statements\" is slightly more specific by using \"auditor's\" instead of \"auditors,\" which may be appropriate if the context refers to a single auditor. However, the original text uses the plural \"審計師,\" so \"auditors\" is more accurate.\nTranslation 4: \"Auditors bear responsibility for the audit of financial statements.\" This translation uses \"bear responsibility,\" which is a valid expression, but \"for\" again may not be the most natural preposition in this context.\nTranslation 5: \"Responsibility of the Auditor for the Audit of Financial Statements\" is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"Auditor\" with a capital letter, which may imply a specific auditor rather than auditors in general. It also uses \"for\" instead of \"in.\"\nTranslation 6: \"The responsibilities that auditors bear in auditing financial statements.\" This translation is more verbose and uses \"auditing\" instead of \"audit,\" which is slightly different in tone. It is grammatically correct but may be unnecessarily wordy.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use \"The responsibility of auditors in the audit of financial statements,\" which is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the appropriate preposition \"in.\" It also accurately reflects the original text's use of the plural \"審計師\" and the term \"財務報表\" as \"financial statements.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is:\nThe responsibility of auditors in the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the overall financial statements do not contain any material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material misstatements if they, individually or in aggregate, are reasonably expected to affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the audit guidelines of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a rigorous skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or override of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \nUnderstand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;  \nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority are reasonable;  \nDetermine whether the Monetary Authority's practice of using the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained as of the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and time period of the Programme, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have already complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have already complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. All translations capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms such as \"審核\" (audit), \"財務\" (financial), \"報告\" (report), and \"關鍵審計事項\" (key audit matters).\n- Most translations use \"key audit matters\" or \"critical audit matters\" appropriately.\n- The structure of the sentence is generally maintained, with the main clause describing the determination of key audit matters and the conditions under which they are not disclosed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"public disclosure\" but fails to use the dictionary term \"publicly\" for \"公開.\"\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly translates \"審核委員會轄下\" as \"Sub-Committee of audit\" instead of \"under the Audit Committee.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"public interest generated by such communication,\" which is slightly awkward and not the most natural phrasing.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"legal requirements\" instead of \"laws and regulations\" and omits the dictionary term \"publicly\" for \"公開.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"form key audit matters\" instead of \"constitute key audit matters,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly translates \"審核委員會轄下\" as \"Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund audits\" and uses \"public well-being\" instead of \"public interest.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used as specified, particularly \"publicly\" for \"公開\" and \"public interest\" for \"公眾利益.\"\n- Use \"constitute key audit matters\" instead of \"forming key audit matters\" or \"key audit issues.\"\n- Maintain the structure of the sentence to reflect the original meaning accurately.\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most critical to the audit of the current period's financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit the public disclosure of a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nAuditor-General  \nZhu Nai-chang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
