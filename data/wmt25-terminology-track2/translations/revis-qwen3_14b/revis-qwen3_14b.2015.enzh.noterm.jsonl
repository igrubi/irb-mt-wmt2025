{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015年重點亮點回顧\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求轉弱及出口表現欠佳。本地股市在全球金融市場波動加劇的背景下出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始降溫。\n\n香港銀行業依然保持韌性。本地註冊的持牌機構（AIs）資本充足，其流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但整體仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，強方貨幣發鈔承擔機制在四月、九月及十月多次被觸發。儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，港元匯率市場仍有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外來衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。在美國聯邦儲備委員會決定上調聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港的基準利率於12月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n針對人工智慧的風險治理監督措施已加強，包括信貸與流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢與打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售行為。\n各譯文在整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的內容，但在語感、用詞選擇與語序安排上仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「信貸與流動性風險管理系統」、「反洗錢與打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施」等，語序自然，符合中文表達習慣，是目前最接近理想譯文的版本。\n2. **第二譯文**：用詞如「風險管治」、「監察」等雖不錯誤，但略顯生硬，語序也稍顯不自然，如「投資及保險產品銷售行為的監察」語序較為拗口。\n3. **第三譯文**：用詞如「信用及流動性風險管理體系」、「管控機制」、「銷售實務」等雖具專業性，但語感稍顯繁複，與原文的簡潔風格略有出入。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，但「反恐融資控制」略顯簡略，與原文「counter-terrorist financing controls」相比，稍顯不足；「投資與保險產品的銷售行為」語序自然，但整體語感稍顯平淡。\n5. **第五譯文**：語序較為繁複，如「針對人工智慧的風險治理所進行的監管措施，包括……」語感稍顯拖沓，與原文的簡潔風格不完全契合。\n6. **第六譯文**：用詞如「風險治理的監管力度」、「信用和流動性風險管理體系」、「打擊資助恐怖主義控制措施」等雖準確，但語序與語感略顯不自然，如「打擊資助恐怖主義」與原文「counter-terrorist financing」相比，語意稍有偏差。\n**改進方向**：在語感與語序上，應追求自然流暢，避免過於繁複或生硬的表達；在用詞上，應選擇符合中文語境的專業術語，如「信貸與流動性風險管理系統」、「反洗錢與打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施」等，既準確又自然。此外，應避免過度翻譯，如「管控機制」、「銷售實務」等詞語雖具專業性，但與原文語境不完全契合。\n**最佳譯文**：在綜合考量語感、語序與用詞準確性的基礎上，第一譯文已相當接近理想版本，僅需微調語序與語感，使其更符合中文表達習慣。因此，最終譯文如下：\n針對人工智慧的風險治理監督措施已加強，包括信貸與流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢與打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆週期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要性銀行。有關在香港建立金融機構解決機制，以及透過加快賠付以加強存款保障計劃的立法建議，已分別提交立法會。\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布在香港實施逆週期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要性銀行。有關在香港建立金融機構解決機制，以及透過加快賠付以加強存款保障計劃的立法建議，已分別提交立法會。\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆週期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要性銀行。有關在香港建立金融機構解決機制，以及透過加快賠付以加強存款保障計劃的立法建議，已分別提交立法會。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，同時不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為改善稅務環境，以推動香港成為企業財務中心樞紐，有關立法建議已於12月提交立法會。\n\n香港仍然是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，擁有市場深度與廣度兼具的規模。內地與香港基金互認安排於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因十二月成功推出電子支票服務而進一步增強，讓客戶可於網上簽發及存入支票。一套新的監管制度將於十一月開始實施，該制度允許為多用途儲值設施發牌，並指定重要的零售支付系統。\n\n# 儲備管理  \n在充滿挑戰的投資環境下，儲備基金錄得整體投資回報率為-0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達到3,4229億港元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化進程，特別是透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）進行投資。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計達1,421億港元，其中包括913億港元的私募股權投資及508億港元的房地產投資，未償還的投資承諾金額達1,224億港元。\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" a heading likely used in a business or organizational context.

The use of \"企業\" is more formal and appropriate for corporate contexts, while \"公司\" is more general and may be used in less formal settings. \"功能\" is a direct translation of \"functions,\" while \"職能\" implies a more defined role or responsibility, which may be more appropriate depending on context.\n- **Weaknesses:** The use of \"職能\" may not be the most accurate translation of \"functions\" in this context, as it can imply a more specific or defined role rather than a range of functions. Additionally, the lack of a hash symbol (#) in the fourth translation may be an oversight if the original formatting is to be preserved.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** In a corporate or formal business setting, \"企業功能\" is the most natural and widely accepted translation. It is concise, clear, and aligns with common usage in business documents and presentations.\n- **Improvements:** To ensure clarity and consistency with the original formatting, the best translation should retain the hash symbol and use \"企業功能\" for its accuracy and natural usage in corporate contexts.\nBased on this review, the most appropriate translation is \"# 企業功能.\"\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。為進一步提升公司治理水平，管理局支持員工專業發展，建立嚴謹的財務紀律，加強資訊安全，並重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以應對因推行新措施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。為進一步提升公司治理水平，管理局支持員工專業發展，建立嚴謹的財務紀律，加強資訊安全，並重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以應對因推行新措施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年增長放緩，反映內需疲弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部環境及脆弱的金融市場條件下持續疲軟。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟在今年的增長有所減緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增幅由2014年的2.6%減至2.4%（見表1）。這反映出本地需求擴張較為溫和，不過淨出口再度成為GDP增長的正面因素，因總進口量下降速度高於總出口量（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平穩，勞動市場維持大致穩定，失業率保持在約3.3%的低水平。通脹進一步緩和，因國內成本及進口價格的壓力有所減緩。受全球金融市場波動升溫的影響，本地股市出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始出現軟化跡象，至年底樓價進一步顯示出整固跡象。\n\n圖表1 按貢獻分類的實際本地生產總值增長  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目分類的實質GDP成長率（環比）\n\n註：目前尚無經季節性調整的國內固定資本形成總額季度對季度變動率數據。  \n來源：統計及普查局。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年香港維持了匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率持續徘徊於7.75附近。由於與股權相關的資金流入，強方兌換承諾於4月被觸發，其後在9月及10月再次啟動，反映離岸人民幣兌換為港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總結餘規模擴大，本地利率持續保持在低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在美國於12月中旬加息後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求疲軟，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但分類貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年國內需求增長速度放緩。儘管就業與收入狀況整體穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱與資產價格修正，對下半年私人消費增長造成壓力。然而，由於上半年增長動能較強，全年私人消費增長率從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費則以3.4%的增速小幅加快。事實上，國內需求增長放緩主要歸因於固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（見圖2）。私人部門機械設備購置連續第二年下滑，企業信心惡化，建築與工程活動也因公共工程進展較慢而呈現較弱的增長動能。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港2015年的出口表現惡化（見圖3）。貨物出口出現全面下滑，跌幅達1.7%，為自2009年以來首次出現下跌。對日本和歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口則增長有限。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦對區域內工業活動及區域貿易造成壓力。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間及最終需求疲弱而下降。香港的服務出口持續從過去幾年的高增長軌道放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊活動放緩所致。貨物進口亦因國內及出口引致的需求疲弱而回落。相對而言，服務進口的增長則因本地居民旅遊意願強勁而加快。從淨出口來看，整體貿易順差在2015年略有改善，對GDP增長作出輕微正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 內需  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，潛在通脹進一步緩和，主要受到本地成本壓力減退及進口物價通脹降低的影響。剔除政府一次性緩解措施的影響後，潛在通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖表4）。由於經濟活動平靜，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業物業租金壓力則有所緩解，尤其是在下半年。受惠於全球商品價格下跌及港元保持強勁，進口物價壓力減輕，而食品通脹亦維持低位。由於較早季度新租賃住宅租金的傳導效應溫和，通脹的租金組成部分仍然受到控制。\n\n圖表3 商品及服務出口  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價通脹  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe term \"Labour market\" is a standard economic concept referring to the interaction between employers and workers in the context of employment. The translations provided by the junior translators all aim to capture this meaning, but there are subtle differences in terminology and formatting.\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"# 勞動市場\", which is appropriate for headings or titles, as the \"#\" symbol is commonly used in lists or sections. The second translation, \"# 就業市場\", uses \"就業\" which is more about employment in a general sense, but slightly less precise than \"勞動\" in the context of a market. The third translation, \"勞動市場\", omits the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate in some contexts but less so for a heading. The fifth translation, \"勞工市場\", uses \"勞工\" which is more specific to workers, but may be narrower in scope than \"Labour market\" which includes both employers and workers.\nConsidering the context of a heading or title, the use of the \"#\" symbol is appropriate. Between \"勞動市場\" and \"就業市場\", \"勞動市場\" is more precise and commonly used in economic terminology. Therefore, the best translation would be \"# 勞動市場\", which is both accurate and appropriately formatted for a heading.\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。雖然貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數有所減少，但其他商業部門的招聘步伐穩健，有效抵銷了此降幅，使總體就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。同時，勞動供給也增加1.3%，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖表5）。鑑於勞動市場依然緊張，今年前三個季度名義工資上漲4.7%，較2014年的4.3%有所提高。隨著通脹壓力緩和，實際工資在前三個季度增長1.3%，與2014年同期出現0.1%的下降形成對比。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在外部環境急劇變化下經歷了一年波動。第一季表現平穩，但隨着內地A股市場看漲情緒興起及資金流入，本地股市在第二季表現強勁。4月恆生指數急升至七年來最高水平，滬港通南向每日額度自2014年11月啟動以來首次用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地市場轉向下跌，受內地A股市場及全球股市拋售潮、全球外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格走弱等因素影響，恆生指數在9月跌至年度低點，跌幅達28%。隨著全球及內地金融市場逐步穩定，本地股市在第四季有所回升。2015年全年，恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然下半年集資活動有所減緩，但來自本地股市的股本集資總額仍由去年同期的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷一段活躍期後，住宅物業市場於2月第七輪審慎措施公布後趨於軟化。儘管房價在第四季下跌前上漲速度放緩，但2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%，降至55,982單位，因二級市場交易活動在下半年明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短線倒賣交易，持續維持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍受壓，樓價收入比達到15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均水準。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但交易活動隨後趨於軟化，價格及租金在去年第四季均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖表6 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預期將維持疲軟。私人機構分析師預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府則預測增長幅度將在1至2%之間。具體而言，疲弱的全球增長前景、持續低迷的入境旅遊以及全球金融市場波動所帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在本地方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因經濟動能較弱，勞動市場情況可能面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或會削弱消費信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及建設活動或可維持穩定，但企業信心疲弱及利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n以上是六位初級翻譯者對原文 \"# Inflation and the labour market\" 的翻譯。從翻譯品質、語法、用詞及文化適切性來看，各有優缺點。\n首先，所有翻譯都正確地將 \"Inflation\" 翻譯為「通貨膨脹」或「通膨」，其中「通貨膨脹」較為正式且常用於經濟學術語，而「通膨」則較為簡潔，但可能在正式場合中稍顯口語。其次，「labour market」被翻譯為「勞動市場」或「勞工市場」，兩者皆正確，但「勞動市場」更符合經濟學術語的常用表達。\n在標點符號方面，有四位翻譯者在標題前加上了「#」符號，與原文格式一致，這在現代數位內容中常見，用以標示標題或主題。然而，若此文本用於正式出版物或學術文章，可能需考慮是否保留此符號。\n此外，第五位翻譯者使用了「通膨」一詞，雖然在經濟學中偶爾見到，但「通貨膨脹」仍是更標準的翻譯。第六位翻譯者使用了「勞工市場」，雖然語意相近，但「勞動市場」更常見於經濟學術語中。\n綜合考量語法、用詞、文化適切性與格式一致性，最佳翻譯應為「# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場」，既保留原文格式，又使用標準經濟學術語，語意明確且自然流暢。\n\n2016年的通貨膨脹壓力預期將維持在可控範圍內。進口價格壓力料將保持溫和，而國內成本壓力在經濟增長動能適中之際亦預計屬溫和。由於2015年底新租賃住宅租金壓力減緩，通脹中的租金成分也可能趨緩。市場共識預測2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預計核心通脹率為2.0%。受入境旅遊減緩及出口部門持續低迷影響，勞動市場也可能略微放緩。民間機構分析師目前預計2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n二〇一六年經濟前景面臨多項不確定因素和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的節奏、全球增長前景以及大宗商品價格的波動，將繼續是主要的不確定來源。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動性，進而導致本地貨幣和金融條件趨緊，並對香港的增長前景造成影響。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將在很大程度上取決於它們通過財富效應和資產負債表效應對樓市的影響。儘管樓市正面臨來自全球和本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及樓市供應與需求差距收窄等因素所帶來的下行風險，但目前仍需更多時間來判斷樓市是否已進入下行週期。雖然樓市出現突然調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但近年來引入的反週期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已大幅增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n所有翻譯版本都大致準確地傳達了「Performance of the Banking Sector」的核心意思，但各有優缺點。第一個翻譯「銀行業績表現」雖然語法正確，但「業績」一詞較偏向財務報表中的具體數據，與「Performance」的廣義含義稍有出入。第二、第三、第四個翻譯使用「表現」一詞，更貼近「Performance」的廣義解釋，但缺少了「Sector」的明確指涉。第五個翻譯「銀行業的表現」雖然語法正確，但多了一個「的」字，使語句略顯冗長。第六個翻譯「銀行業績表現」與第一個相同，同樣存在「業績」一詞的問題。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語義準確性與語句流暢度，「銀行業表現」是最為恰當的翻譯，既保留了「Performance」的廣義含義，也符合傳統中文的語法習慣。\n\n香港銀行業在本年度仍表現出韌性，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的風險不斷積累。獲授權機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的AIs資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但整體仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行間利率全年維持在低水平。零售銀行的港元融資成本上半年因複合利率呈現下降趨勢而下降，下半年則維持穩定（圖7）。\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行間利率全年維持在低水平。零售銀行的港元融資成本上半年因複合利率呈現下降趨勢而下降，下半年則維持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖表7 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n說明：  \n1.

The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the main differences being the use of the hashtag symbol (#) and the choice of vocabulary.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"獲利能力趨勢\"** – This is a direct and accurate translation of \"Profitability trends\" without the hashtag. It is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary. However, it omits the hashtag, which may be important in certain contexts (e.g., social media, reports, or headings).\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# 盈利能力趨勢\"** – This version includes the hashtag and uses the same accurate translation of \"Profitability trends\". It is both grammatically correct and culturally appropriate, especially if the hashtag is intended to be used in a digital or report format.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# 盈利趨勢\"** – This version uses the hashtag but omits \"能力\" (ability), which slightly weakens the meaning of \"Profitability\" as it becomes simply \"Profit trend\". While still understandable, it is less precise.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"盈利趨勢\"** – This is similar to the third translation but omits the hashtag. It is concise and accurate, but again, it lacks the nuance of \"Profitability\" by omitting \"能力\".\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"盈利趨勢\"** – Identical to the fourth, with the same strengths and weaknesses.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# 盈利趨勢\"** – This is the same as the third translation, with the hashtag included but \"能力\" omitted.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe most accurate and complete translation would include both the hashtag and the full term \"盈利能力\" (Profitability), as it best reflects the original English meaning. The hashtag is often used in digital contexts to categorize or label content, so including it is appropriate if the context requires it. Therefore, the best translation would be \"# 盈利能力趨勢\", which is both accurate and contextually appropriate.\n\n銀行業的盈利能力在2015年有所放緩。零售銀行在香港辦事處的總體稅前營運利潤下降了2.8%，雖然手續費及佣金收入（增長9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具營運收入（增長22.4%）以及淨利息收入（增長1.3%）有所增長，但這被營運費用增加8.8%及貸款減值虧損增加76%所抵消。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤則增加14.7%，主要由於處置戰略投資所產生的收益。零售銀行的稅後平均資產報酬率由2014年的0.99%提升至1.05%（圖8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks.

It may not be the most precise term in this context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表3 2015年港幣銀行間利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first translation, so the same evaluation applies.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as above.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表3 2015年香港銀行間利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"香港\" instead of \"港幣,\" which is more natural in Chinese when referring to the currency in context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"銀行間利率\" is still not the most precise term for \"interbank interest rates.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖3 2015年香港銀行同業利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖3\" instead of \"圖表3,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal. \"銀行同業利率\" is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"圖3\" is less formal than \"圖表3,\" which may be less appropriate for a formal or academic context.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表三：二零一五年香港銀行同業拆息利率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖表三\" and \"二零一五年\" for \"Chart 3\" and \"2015,\" which is more formal and traditional. \"銀行同業拆息利率\" is the most precise and commonly used term in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"二零一五年\" is more traditional and may be less common in modern contexts, though still acceptable.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖3 2015年香港美元銀行間拆息率\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖3\" and \"拆息率,\" which is a precise term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly uses \"美元\" (US dollar) instead of \"港幣\" or \"香港\" to refer to the Hong Kong dollar. This is a critical error.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and culturally appropriate. \"圖表3\" is more formal than \"圖3,\" and \"香港銀行同業拆息利率\" is the most accurate and commonly used term in financial contexts. Using \"2015年\" is more modern and widely used than \"二零一五年.\" The sixth translation incorrectly uses \"美元\" instead of \"港幣\" or \"香港,\" which is a major error. Therefore, the best translation combines the formality of \"圖表3,\" the precision of \"香港銀行同業拆息利率,\" and the modern date format \"2015年.\"\n\n圖表4：2015年港幣遠期點數  \n圖表4 港幣遠期點數 2015  \n圖表四：二零一五年港幣遠期點數  \n圖表4 2015年港元遠期點數  \n圖四 2015年香港 dollar 遠期點數  \n圖4 2015年港元期貨點數  \n上述六種翻譯各有優缺點。第一種翻譯「圖表4：2015年港幣遠期點數」語法正確，用詞準確，符合中文標題的常見格式。第二種「圖表4 港幣遠期點數 2015」雖語法通順，但年份置於末尾略顯不自然。第三種使用「圖表四」與「二零一五年」，雖符合繁體字寫法，但「圖表四」在正式文件中較少見，通常使用數字「4」更為常見。第四種「圖表4 2015年港元遠期點數」用詞準確，但「港元」與「港幣」在金融領域中「港幣」更為常用。第五種「圖四 2015年香港 dollar 遠期點數」中「dollar」未翻譯，且「圖四」較少見於正式文件。第六種「圖4 2015年港元期貨點數」將「forward points」誤譯為「期貨點數」，與原意不符。\n綜合考量，最佳翻譯應使用「圖表4：2015年港幣遠期點數」，此版本語法正確、用詞準確，符合中文標題格式與金融領域常用術語。\n圖表4：2015年港幣遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。鑒於香港經濟規模細小且開放，以及其作為國際金融中心的地位，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定不移地致力維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，公眾對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具的信心持續強勁。在二零一五年與香港進行的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續肯定聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於各譯文在語法、用詞及語境傳達上均有不同程度的優點與不足，以下為綜合評估與改進建議：\n1. **用詞準確性**：多數譯文正確使用了「聯繫匯率制度（LERS）」、「壓力測試」、「弱方保證金（CU）」等專業術語，但第五譯文誤將「LERS」翻譯為「優質流動性提升機制」，此為明顯錯誤，應修正為「聯繫匯率制度」。\n2. **語句流暢度**：第一、第四與第六譯文語句較為流暢，符合中文表達習慣；第二與第三譯文雖語法正確，但偶有語氣較為生硬；第五譯文則因「香港 dollar」與「香港 dollar 利率」的不當翻譯，影響整體語感。\n3. **語境與文化適應性**：所有譯文均能傳達原文政策性與專業性語境，但第五譯文因「香港 dollar」的錯誤使用，顯得不專業；此外，「弱方保證金」與「弱方兌換保證」的翻譯需統一，建議採用「弱方保證金（CU）」以符合常見金融術語。\n4. **語法與標點**：多數譯文語法正確，但第五譯文存在「香港 dollar」與「香港 dollar 利率」的重複錯誤，且標點使用不一致，影響閱讀體驗。\n**改進方向**：在保留專業術語準確性的前提下，提升語句流暢度與語感自然度，統一術語翻譯，避免重複與不當用詞，並確保語境與文化適應性。\n鑒於上述評估，最佳翻譯應具備以下特徵：\n- 使用正確且統一的專業術語（如「聯繫匯率制度（LERS）」、「弱方保證金（CU）」）。\n- 語句流暢自然，符合中文表達習慣。\n- 標點使用正確，語氣專業且易於理解。\n鑒於以上分析，最佳翻譯如下：\n鑑於健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的抗風險能力。面對美國利率上升的情況，香港金融管理局提醒公眾做好風險管理的必要準備，指出觸發弱方保證金及港元流出，是港元利率正常化的自然且必要過程。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分用以支撐貨幣基礎。2015年，支撐比率（定義為支撐資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3%至107.5%的窄幅範圍內，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平，並於12月31日收市於106.3%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已將特定發行基金資產指定用作支撐組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源在面對突發性衝擊時，可提供強大的後盾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖表5 2015年支撐比率每日波動情況\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局聯繫基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣基金委員會小組負責監察及審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組審視的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應、國際間宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基準利率的計算公式、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組的討論記錄及提交給該小組的貨幣基金委員會運作報告，均已在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港貨幣研究機構（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。2015年，該機構資助了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n各版本翻譯在語法和用詞上大致正確，但存在一些細節上的差異。第一、二、三、五、六版的翻譯較為接近，僅在「舉辦」與「主辦」、「五場」與「五項」、「和」與「與」、「及」與「和」等詞語選擇上略有不同。第四版使用了「五項」，這在語義上與「五場」略有差異，「項」通常用於抽象概念或項目，而「場」更常用於具體活動次數，因此「五場」更為準確。此外，第四版的「其中主要包括」語氣略顯重複，不如「其中主要的包括」自然。\n綜合考量語義準確性、語氣自然度與常用表達方式，最佳翻譯應為：該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n\n* 2024年1月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟研討會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會中發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，內容涵蓋中國企業槓桿、信貸擴張與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。  \n* 2024年5月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長研討會」。會議探討多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場等。  \n* 2024年10月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會。會議深入探討貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率之間的關係、貨幣政策分歧對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n本院亦於八月舉辦第十三屆HKIMR夏季研討會，並於九月舉辦第十三屆HKIMR內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。這些會議與研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，本院當年共舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛議題。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通中的紙幣總值為3602億港元，較一年前增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。其中，政府發行的10港元紙幣流通總值為40億港元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在認可機構的風險治理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理體系、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售實務。隨著系統性風險的積累，金管局於2016年1月1日宣布在香港實施0.625%的逆週期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。五間認可機構被指定為本地系統重要銀行，將需遵守較高的損失吸收能力資本緩衝。在《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會後，有關恢復與解決機制的改革取得重大進展。金管局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融從業人員的技能與知識水平。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的背景下，新興市場在2015年面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的壓力。為維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境可能急劇惡化的情況下保持韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監察獲授權機構（AIs）風險治理機制及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統的有效性。\n在評估各份譯文後，可以看出各譯者在語意傳達上大致準確，但在語句流暢度、用詞精準度與語境適切性方面仍有提升空間。例如，「divergence in monetary policy stances」譯為「貨幣政策立場出現分歧」較為自然，但部分譯文使用「跡象」或「背景下」等詞語，語氣略顯生硬。此外，「authorized institutions」譯為「授權機構」或「持牌金融機構」皆可接受，但「獲授權機構（AIs）」較符合官方文件常用語。\n在語法與語序方面，部分譯文存在語序不自然或重複用詞的問題，如「風險增加及經濟增長放緩的更高風險」語意重複，應簡化為「風險上升及經濟增長放緩的壓力」。此外，「維持銀行體系在可能突然惡化的宏觀經濟環境中的韌性」語序略顯拗口，調整為「維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境可能急劇惡化的情況下保持韌性」更符合中文表達習慣。\n綜合考量語意準確性、語句流暢度與語境適切性，最終譯文在保留原意的同時，使語句更自然、語序更符合中文習慣，並使用較為正式且符合官方文件語境的用詞，如「獲授權機構（AIs）」、「風險治理機制」、「信貸及流動性風險管理系統」等，使整體譯文更具專業性與可讀性。\n\n# 運營監督\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe term \"Operational supervision\" is a formal and technical phrase, typically used in business, management, or regulatory contexts. The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and limitations.\n1. **# 作業監督** – This translation uses \"作業\" which means \"operation\" or \"task,\" and is commonly used in contexts such as \"作業流程\" (operational process). However, \"作業\" can sometimes imply more routine or task-based work, which may not fully capture the broader, strategic nature of \"operational supervision.\"\n2. **運作監督** – \"運作\" is a more general and formal term for \"operation,\" often used in business and management contexts. It is a strong candidate as it conveys the idea of overseeing the functioning of a system or organization. However, it is repeated in both the second and fourth translations, suggesting it is a common but not necessarily the most precise choice.\n3. **# 操作監督** – \"操作\" is more technical and refers to the act of operating or manipulating something, often used in contexts like \"操作系統\" (operating system). While accurate in some contexts, it may be too narrow for \"operational supervision,\" which is more about oversight than direct manipulation.\n4. **營運監督** – \"營運\" is a business-specific term that refers to the management and operation of a business or organization. It is more precise than \"運作\" in a corporate or commercial context and is arguably the most appropriate term for \"operational supervision\" in a business setting.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nWhile all translations are grammatically correct and convey the general idea, the best translation should reflect the precise meaning of \"operational supervision\" in a formal and business context. \"營運監督\" is the most accurate and contextually appropriate term, as it directly corresponds to the management and oversight of business operations. It is more precise than \"運作監督\" and better captures the strategic and managerial aspect of supervision in an organizational setting.\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，即在進行常規現場檢查的同時，增加主題性審查的次數。主題性審查是針對選定持牌機構群組的特定風險領域或特定活動而進行的深入非現場審查。這種方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於持牌機構所面臨的新興及更重大的風險。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）本年度共進行了193次現場檢查。鑒於授權機構貸款組合資產質素出現惡化跡象，HKMA加強了針對信貸風險管理及資產質素的深入主題性現場檢查。面對主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧所引致的市場不確定性，HKMA亦增加了對財務相關活動的檢查次數。此外，HKMA亦對與內地業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及授權機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。本年度內，專門團隊亦對授權機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相似的範疇。表1詳列運作監督工作的細節。\n\n2015年，共進行了196次非現場審查，以評估金融機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點包括風險治理、資本規劃、企業信貸及巴塞爾III標準的落實監督。監管團隊持續與所選金融機構的董事會及外部審計師保持密切聯繫。與金融機構的高層管理人員及外部審計師舉行了20次三方會議，同時與所選金融機構的董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行監管審查委員會審議了四宗案件，均涉及人工智能的授權事宜。\nThe original English sentence is concise and formal, suitable for an official or regulatory context. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and formality.\n1. The first translation uses “銀行業監督審查委員會” which is slightly wordy compared to the more commonly used “銀行監管審查委員會.” It also uses “案例” which is more general than “案件,” which is more precise in a regulatory or legal context.\n2. The second translation uses “銀行監理審查委員會,” where “監理” is less standard than “監管” in the context of banking supervision. “審議” is appropriate, and “授權問題” is slightly more formal than necessary.\n3. The third translation uses “審理” which is typically used in judicial contexts, not regulatory ones. “審理” implies a court proceeding, which is not accurate here. “涉及” is appropriate, but “案例” is again less precise than “案件.”\n4. The fourth translation uses “銀行監管審查委員會” which is accurate, and “審議” is appropriate. “四宗案件” is more natural in a formal context than “四個案例.” “授權事宜” is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\n5. The fifth translation is very close to the original, using “審查” which is slightly less formal than “審議.” “案例” is again less precise than “案件.”\n6. The sixth translation is very similar to the fourth, using “審議” and “四宗案件,” which are both appropriate. “授權事宜” is slightly more formal than necessary but still acceptable.\nConsidering these points, the best translation should use “銀行監管審查委員會” for accuracy, “審議” for formality, “四宗案件” for precision, and “授權事宜” for a slightly formal but natural tone. This combination provides the most accurate and natural rendering of the original English sentence in Traditional Chinese.\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對多項優先事項，香港金融管理局持續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條所賦予的權力，要求持牌機構委任外部審計師跟進可能對監管構成重大影響的問題。2015年，香港金融管理局根據該條款委託進行了六份報告，其中兩份報告涉及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告則涉及私人銀行業務，其餘兩份則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，並無任何認可機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。雖然根據條例各項條文共有84宗違規情況，但均未影響存款人的利益，且已由相關機構迅速糾正。\n\n表1 操作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance.

The goal is to convey a clear, professional, and natural-sounding title in Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: “# 業務及科技風險監督”**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the hashtag “#” as in the original, and the term “業務” (business) is appropriate for “operational.”  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “監督” is slightly less common than “監督” or “監控” in this context. Also, the use of “業務” may be too broad or vague compared to “operational.”\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: “作業及科技風險的監督”**  \n   - **Strengths:** “作業” is a direct translation of “operational” and is commonly used in technical contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “的監督” is slightly wordy and less formal than alternatives.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: “營運及科技風險監控”**  \n   - **Strengths:** “營運” is a strong and precise term for “operational,” and “監控” is a natural fit for “supervision” in a risk management context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The omission of the hashtag “#” may be an issue if it is required for consistency with the original.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: “監督操作及技術風險”**  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure is clear and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “技術” is more general than “technology” in a risk context, and the phrase is slightly less formal than alternatives.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: “# 操作與科技風險的監督”**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the hashtag and the term “操作” (operation) is accurate. “與” is more natural than “及” in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “的監督” is slightly wordy and less formal than alternatives.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: “對營運及科技風險的監督”**  \n   - **Strengths:** “營運” is precise, and the structure is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “對...的監督” is slightly more verbose than necessary for a title.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and natural in a professional context. “操作與科技風險的監督” combines the clarity of “操作” (operation), the precision of “科技” (technology), and the natural use of “與” (and) in a title. It also avoids unnecessary words like “的” after the noun phrase, which is common in titles. The hashtag “#” is retained to match the original format. This version is both accurate and stylistically appropriate for a formal setting.\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續根據新興風險和行業發展，發佈新的或更新的營運及科技風險管理指引。特別是，HKMA已完成對《監管政策手冊》（SPM）中與電子銀行（e-banking）相關模組的修訂，使認可機構在提供新電子銀行服務方面擁有更大靈活性。此外，HKMA亦發佈了有關網絡安全的通函，重申認可機構董事會及高層管理人員需對有效的網絡安全風險管理進行監督的重要性。HKMA亦定期發佈「營運事件觀察」，重點介紹所選詐騙案例或營運事件的作案手法，以及所發現的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局進行了以風險為本的主題性現場及非現場監管審查，以評估選定的認可機構（AIs）在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋了與AIs營運風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防範異常交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、詐欺風險管理以及反洗錢科技控制等特定範疇。這些監管審查亦由年度獨立合規檢查作為補充，檢查內容包括營運風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性計劃，其中選定的AIs須聘請獨立且具資格的評估人員，審查其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別並分析AIs營運及科技風險的趨勢及監管重點，特別針對在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的認可機構。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）監督銀行業在2015年底完成基於晶片的自動櫃員機（ATM）技術的最後階段實施，透過此技術，發卡機構已完成純信用卡的換卡程序。HKMA亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制措施，以進一步提升「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，在接獲報告指某些非接觸式信用卡中儲存的持卡人姓名可能被隱秘地存取後，HKMA要求有關發卡機構立即採取行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。HKMA亦投入資源向公眾宣傳和解釋事件的規模及影響，以緩解公眾擔憂，並監督發卡機構的糾正措施，包括及時更換受影響的卡片。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦提高公眾對電子銀行安全預防措施認識的宣傳活動、建立分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支援和建議，該演習參與機構包括人工智能公司及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a heading: **\"Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses.\"** The goal is to translate this into a clear, professional, and culturally appropriate Traditional Chinese heading.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   *# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately captures the key terms: \"wealth management\" as \"財富管理,\" \"MPF\" as \"強積金,\" and \"supervision\" as \"監管.\" The structure is clear and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of the hashtag (#) is unnecessary in a formal or official context.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   *# 審視財富管理及強積金相關業務*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"審視\" (review\/scrutiny) instead of \"監管\" (supervision), which is slightly different in nuance.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"審視\" is not the best equivalent for \"supervision\" in a regulatory context. It implies a more passive or observational role rather than active oversight. Also, the hashtag is unnecessary.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   *# 資產管理及強積金相關業務監管*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"資產管理\" (asset management) instead of \"財富管理\" (wealth management), which is a valid synonym.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"資產管理\" is slightly broader and may not fully capture the nuance of \"wealth management.\" Also, the hashtag is unnecessary.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   *財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管*  \n   - **Strengths:** This is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses the correct terms and structure without unnecessary punctuation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. It is concise, professional, and appropriate for a formal context.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   *# 理財及強制性公積金相關業務的監管*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"理財\" (financial planning) and \"強制性公積金\" (Mandatory Provident Fund), which are accurate terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"理財\" is more general and less precise than \"財富管理.\" Also, the hashtag is unnecessary.  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   *# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管*  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first junior translator's version, which is accurate and professional.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is unnecessary in a formal context.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe most accurate and natural translation is the fourth junior translator's version: *財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管*. It uses the correct terminology, maintains the formal tone, and avoids unnecessary punctuation. The hashtag is not appropriate in this context, as it is typically used in social media or informal settings. Therefore, the best translation is the same as the fourth junior translator's, but without the hashtag.\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就持牌機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期溝通。這些會議涵蓋金融服務業不同領域中，業務關係密切的金融集團或受規管實體所涉及的各項議題，以確保監管行動更加協調和有效。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）本年度進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項非現場監察，針對持牌機構（AIs）。這些檢查涵蓋投資產品銷售、證券交易結算處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品及強積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月份，香港金融管理局向持牌機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售非保證投資連結保險（NLTI）產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助持牌機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n八月份，香港金融管理局向持牌機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售非保證投資連結保險（NLTI）產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助持牌機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財政及庫務局（FSTB）在《保險公司（修訂）條例2014》的立法過程中密切合作，以建立一個獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人設立法定牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過《保險公司（修訂）條例2015》，其中規定透過授權，賦予金融管理局對保險中介人活動進行檢查和調查的權力。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由註冊機構提出的從事額外受規管活動的申請。該局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券活動的高級人員，並對由註冊機構提交、用以納入香港金融管理局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行了背景調查。\n\n# 財務活動的監督\nReview of the translations:\nThe original English phrase \"Supervision of treasury activities\" is a formal title, likely used in an official or institutional context. The junior translators have attempted to convey this meaning in Traditional Chinese, but with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n1. **國庫活動監督** – This translation is accurate in terms of vocabulary. \"國庫\" means \"national treasury,\" and \"活動監督\" translates to \"supervision of activities.\" However, the phrase is somewhat abrupt and lacks the natural flow expected in formal titles.\n2. **庫務活動監督** – \"庫務\" is a more general term for \"treasury affairs\" or \"financial management,\" which may be more appropriate in certain contexts. However, it is less specific than \"國庫\" and may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"treasury activities.\"\n3. **# 國庫活動監督** – This is identical to the first translation, but with a hashtag. The hashtag is unnecessary in formal titles and may be a formatting error.\n4. **# 財務活動監督** – This translation uses \"財務\" (financial) instead of \"國庫,\" which is a broader term and may not be as precise. The hashtag is again unnecessary.\n5. **財務活動的監督** – This is the most natural-sounding translation. It uses \"財務活動\" (financial activities) and \"的監督\" (supervision of), which is a common structure in formal titles. However, \"財務\" is broader than \"treasury\" and may not be as specific as intended.\n6. **庫務監督** – This is the most concise translation, but it omits \"activities\" and may be too vague for the intended context.\nReasoning for improvement:\nThe best translation should be both accurate and natural-sounding in formal contexts. \"國庫活動監督\" is accurate but lacks fluency. \"財務活動的監督\" is more natural but less specific. A balanced approach would be to use \"國庫活動監督\" but adjust the structure slightly for better flow.\nImproved translation:\n國庫活動監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續將持牌機構（AIs）的流動性風險管理列為其監管重點之一，特別是在美國利率正常化預期及隨後可能出現的資金流動逆轉，對AIs流動性狀況可能產生影響的情況下。在2015年全年，HKMA繼續實施針對AIs的強化穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金來支持貸款業務。自2015年1月1日開始實施巴塞爾協議III的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，HKMA一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構一般維持LCR接近或超過100%，遠高於根據過渡安排於2015年所設定的法定最低要求60%。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）針對選定的授權機構，就其管理預期利率正常化相關風險的控制架構進行主題性現場檢查。在市場波動期間，HKMA亦密切關注市場突變及其對銀行業及個別授權機構的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 管理層主導的壓力測試計畫\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English phrase is **\"Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\"**, which implies a stress testing initiative that is driven or led by a supervisor or supervisory body. The term \"supervisor\" can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on context—such as a manager, a regulatory authority, or a supervisory function within an organization.\n1. **Translation 1: 管理層主導的壓力測試方案**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"管理層\" (management) is a natural and widely used term in corporate or organizational contexts. \"方案\" (programme\/scheme) is appropriate for formal initiatives.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"方案\" is slightly more informal than \"計畫\" (plan\/programme), which might be more suitable for a formal or regulatory context.\n2. **Translation 2: 監督主導的壓力測試計劃**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"監督\" (supervision) is a direct translation of \"supervisor.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"監督\" is more about the act of overseeing rather than the entity doing the overseeing. It lacks the nuance of a supervisory body or role. \"計劃\" is appropriate, but the term \"監督\" may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"supervisor.\"\n3. **Translation 3: 主管主導的壓力測試計畫**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"主管\" (supervisor\/manager) is a common term in business contexts. \"計畫\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"主管\" is more of an individual role, whereas \"supervisor\" in this context may refer to a broader supervisory function or authority.\n4. **Translation 4: 主管驅動壓力測試方案**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"驅動\" (driven) is a direct and accurate translation of \"driven.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The lack of a hash (#) and the use of \"方案\" again may be less formal than desired. Also, \"主管\" may not fully capture the supervisory or regulatory aspect.\n5. **Translation 5: 監管機構主導的壓力測試計畫**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"監管機構\" (regulatory authority) is precise and appropriate if the context is regulatory.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** This translation assumes a regulatory context, which may not be the case. The original term \"supervisor\" is more general and could refer to internal management or oversight.\n6. **Translation 6: 督導主導的壓力測試計畫**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"督導\" (supervision\/oversight) is a formal term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"督導\" is more about the act of guiding or overseeing, not the entity doing the overseeing. It may not fully capture the role of a \"supervisor.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, formality, and clarity. \"管理層\" (management) is a broad and appropriate term for \"supervisor\" in a corporate or organizational context. \"計畫\" is more formal and suitable for a structured initiative like a stress testing programme. Combining these, **\"管理層主導的壓力測試計畫\"** is the most accurate and natural translation. It conveys the idea of a stress testing programme led by management, which aligns well with the original English phrase.\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更深入地了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟環境下的韌性，並鼓勵銀行制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。為更深入掌握所選領域的風險動態，本年度引入多項改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料。香港金融管理局分析了參與機構提交的測試結果，並與其討論如何進一步改善壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n所有翻譯版本在基本語義上都正確，但存在一些細節差異。第一、二、五、六位翻譯者使用了「資產品質」，而第三位使用了「資產質量」，第四位則使用了「貸款風險管理」。其中「資產質量」在中文語境中較少見，通常使用「資產品質」更為自然。「貸款風險管理」則與原文「credit risk management」不完全對應，因為「credit risk」涵蓋範圍更廣，不僅限於貸款。因此，最佳翻譯應為「信用風險管理與資產品質」。\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n審視各譯本後，可發現幾個關鍵問題。首先，標題格式方面，原文使用「#」符號，但中文標題通常不使用此符號，除非特別強調。其次，「credit growth」的翻譯有「信用增長」、「貸款成長」、「信貸增長」等不同版本，其中「信貸增長」最為準確，因為「信貸」在金融語境中更常用於指代銀行信貸業務的擴張。再者，「asset quality」翻譯為「資產品質」或「資產質量」，其中「資產品質」更符合金融專業術語的使用習慣，而「質量」在中文中多用於產品或服務的品質，與「資產」搭配稍顯不自然。此外，部分譯本在格式上使用了不必要的空格或符號，影響整體視覺效果。綜合考量後，「信貸增長與資產品質」在語義準確性、專業性與格式規範性方面表現最佳，因此作為最終翻譯。\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。就全年而言，銀行業總貸款額增加3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降（見表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從去年同期的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際間的合作與溝通，以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現，繼續獲得信貸評級機構的認可，標準普爾亦維持對香港的最高評級AAA。\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題的討論。今年七月，該局接任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間在政策倡議上的交流，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進有關金融穩定議題的觀點交流。香港金融管理局持續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局密切合作，強化已升格為國際組織的東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作，以監測與分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行規模在本年度因多項市場因素出現一定程度的收縮。然而，市場運作仍然有序，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量保持穩定增長。此外，透過香港進行及在香港展開的人民幣業務不斷擴展，有助於國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）確認人民幣為一種可自由使用的貨幣。IMF將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子的決定，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，以及香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，同時，場外（OTC）衍生工具交易報告庫亦持續支持實體按照2015年7月推出的新型場外衍生工具市場監管制度的要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年進一步加強香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項組成部分及服務，其中包括於同年12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著目前已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動通訊渠道接收及處理客戶的電子支票。自2013年推出電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務以來，2015年商戶參與度持續增長。同年7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMu）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出一項服務，以支持內地與香港互認基金（MRF）的實施。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦隨《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）於11月生效而得到改善。根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，香港金融管理局獲賦權推行多用途儲值設施的強制許可制度，並執行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all very similar and largely accurate. The main difference lies in the use of \"與\" versus \"及\" to connect \"國際\" and \"區域.\" Both are acceptable in formal contexts, but \"與\" is more commonly used in official and formal titles, making it slightly more appropriate for headings such as this one. Additionally, the first, third, and fifth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which is consistent with the original text's formatting. However, in formal or official documents, the use of \"#\" in such contexts is less common unless it is part of a specific numbering or sectioning system. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"國際與區域合作\" without the \"#\" symbol, as it maintains both accuracy and formal tone.\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），與其他司法管轄區合作，推動可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）區域諮詢小組（亞洲）（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦該小組第九次會議。RCG(A) 為 FSB 成員與非 FSB 成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，以處理金融穩定相關議題。來自亞洲 16 個司法管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論該地區所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險制度的經驗。HKMA 亦於八月在香港共同主辦一場有關宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）組織，並邀請來自世界各地 18 個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了各自在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能產生的溢出效應。HKMA 亦與英國央行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同舉辦一場會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策最佳組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了逾百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續履行其對促進亞洲金融穩定及在國際金融事務中發揚地區集體聲音的區域合作倡議的承諾。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行高級別會議（EMEAP）下設的貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監測工作協調人，香港金融管理局持續準備委員會的半年度宏觀監測報告，以評估地區的風險與脆弱性以及相關政策含義。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實踐，以及國內與跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗分享與資訊交流。該局亦領導小組內專門負責跨境合作與發展的子小組。香港金融管理局於六月在香港主辦了EMEAP\/國際清算銀行（BIS）外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議，與會者包括來自地區內17個機構及主要經濟體的代表，會議審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革情況。\n\n繼去年香港與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局簽署AMRO協定後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強版區域貨幣互換機制（CMIM）中的關鍵角色。\n香港與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局去年簽署AMRO協定後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強版區域貨幣互換機制（CMIM）中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切溝通，以呈現香港經濟表現及財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成了2015年所有主要信用評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾維持對香港最高等級的AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體擁有高於平均水平的增長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外資產地位。穆迪投資服務機構和惠譽評級亦分別將香港的評級維持在Aa1和AA+，僅次於三A級一個級別。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original English title is \"# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of the Chinese translation, with minor differences in structure and punctuation.\nThe first and second translations are identical: \"香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展.\" This is a direct and accurate translation, but it lacks the hashtag symbol (#) present in the original English title. The third and fourth translations include the hashtag, which is appropriate for maintaining the format of the original title. However, the use of a hashtag in Chinese titles is not common and may be considered unnecessary or stylistically inconsistent.\nThe fifth translation, \"香港離岸人民幣業務中心的發展,\" omits the preposition \"作為\" (as), which slightly alters the nuance of the original title. While still understandable, it is less precise in conveying the idea of Hong Kong's role as a center.\nThe sixth translation, \"香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心,\" changes the structure of the sentence, making it more active and dynamic. However, it shifts the focus from the \"development\" of Hong Kong as a center to the process of Hong Kong \"becoming\" a center, which is a subtle but meaningful difference in emphasis.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should retain the original structure and meaning while being stylistically appropriate in Chinese. The inclusion of the hashtag is optional and may not be necessary in formal or academic contexts. Therefore, the most accurate and natural translation would be \"香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展,\" which is concise, grammatically correct, and maintains the original meaning without unnecessary stylistic elements.\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池產生影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款及存單餘額為1,010億元，較去年同期的1,158億元有所下降（圖1）。在境內市場利率下行背景下，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩，導致香港人民幣債券發行規模降至75億元。另一方面，香港銀行辦理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長9%，達6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款未償餘額亦年增58%，達297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統的日均交易額增至947億元，較2014年增長29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴展，根據調查結果顯示，2015年4月底日均交易額約為930億美元，較2013年4月上次BIS三年期調查時增長88%。香港仍為最大離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度與廣度俱佳。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推出的MRF計劃，該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界合作提升香港人民幣金融平台的努力，持續取得成果。六月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行將被允許在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯往境外，以便利銀行在離岸市場進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行放寬了跨境人民幣現金池的規定，使更多跨國企業可在簡化安排下進行集團內現金轉移。七月，內地當局亦給予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金更廣泛的准入權，使其可參與境內銀行間債券市場。九月，內地進一步向這些機構開放了外匯市場。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）於2015年11月30日宣布，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此決定肯定了人民幣作為自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步增強國際社會對人民幣在全球交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化，以及中國內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫日益緊密所帶來的新業務機會中受益。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並第二次與馬來西亞及泰國合作，推動私人部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些舉措，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的流動及聯繫，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強市場推廣工作，透過參與在香港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本及非洲）的行業活動，推動企業及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面更廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉國華於2015年12月11日出席香港－倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間，在研討會上發言。\n\n# 《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》\n\n中國內地與香港於11月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東試點自由化措施中的大部分擴展至全國範圍。新協議原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地經營業務提供更多政策確定性和更大靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀保監會的官員提供培訓課程。除涉及中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保護、信貸資料、貨幣及擔保品管理、財務健全性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。此外，亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦了臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n年內，香港金融管理局安排了八次機構政府債券招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}

Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 準備金管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此嚴峻的投資環境下，香港儲備基金在2015年的整體投資回報為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及可比投資基金相比，其虧損相對較輕，這歸功於香港金融管理局近年來部署的一系列防禦性措施，增強了儲備基金的韌性。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n香港發行基金的主要目標，如《發行基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，協助香港維持其國際金融中心的地位。發行基金由財政司司長控制，並在諮詢發行基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所基金管理\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND,\" which appears to be a heading or title, likely from a financial or regulatory document. The goal is to translate this title into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 投資基金之管理**  \n   - *Strengths:* The term \"投資基金\" (investment fund) is a common and accurate translation for \"fund\" in financial contexts.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* The term \"投資基金\" does not align with \"exchange fund,\" which is more likely referring to a specific type of fund related to currency exchange or financial regulation, not a general investment fund. The use of \"之\" is somewhat formal and less commonly used in modern titles.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: # 交易所基金管理**  \n   - *Strengths:* \"交易所\" (exchange) is a direct and accurate translation of \"exchange.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* The term \"基金管理\" (fund management) is too generic and does not clearly convey the specific nature of the fund being managed. It lacks the specificity of \"exchange fund.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 交易所基金的管理**  \n   - *Strengths:* This is a more complete and natural-sounding translation. It uses \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund) and \"的管理\" (management), which is a common structure in Chinese titles.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* The use of \"的\" is slightly redundant in a title and may be omitted for conciseness.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: # 結匯基金管理制度**  \n   - *Strengths:* \"結匯基金\" (conversion fund) is a specific term used in financial contexts, particularly in relation to foreign exchange.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"管理制度\" (management system) is more comprehensive than \"management\" and may be too detailed for a title. It also assumes a system-level approach, which may not be intended.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: # 交換基金的管理**  \n   - *Strengths:* \"交換基金\" (exchange fund) is a direct translation of \"exchange fund.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"交換\" is less commonly used in financial contexts compared to \"交易所\" or \"結匯.\" It may be ambiguous or less precise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: 交易所資金管理**  \n   - *Strengths:* \"交易所資金\" (exchange funds) is a clear and concise term.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"資金管理\" (fund management) is more general and does not clearly indicate that it is about the \"management of the exchange fund\" as a specific entity.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in tone. It should reflect the specific nature of the fund being managed and avoid unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate translation would be **# 交易所基金管理**, which is concise, accurate, and natural in tone. It avoids the redundancy of \"的\" in the title and clearly conveys the subject matter.\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n香港儲備基金管理局已為外匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"香港儲備基金管理局已為儲備基金訂立以下投資目標\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"儲備基金管理局\" (Reserve Fund Management Authority) and \"訂立\" (establish).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Repeats \"儲備基金\" (Reserve Fund) twice, which is redundant and may confuse the reader. Also, \"EFAC\" is not translated, which is a key acronym in the original text.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"香港金融管理局已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund) and \"設定\" (set).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"香港金融管理局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) is not the correct name for EFAC. EFAC is the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, not the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"EFAC為交易所基金設定了以下投資目標\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains the acronym \"EFAC\" and uses \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"交易所基金\" is not the standard term for the Exchange Fund. It is more commonly referred to as \"外匯基金\" in official contexts. Also, the sentence structure is slightly awkward.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"EFAC 已設定下列投資目標，針對交換基金：\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains \"EFAC\" and uses \"交換基金\" (exchange fund).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"針對交換基金\" is awkward phrasing. The original sentence is about setting investment objectives for the Exchange Fund, not targeting it. Also, \"交換基金\" is not the standard term.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"聯邦元基金已設定以下投資目標：\"  \n   - **Strengths:** None.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"聯邦元基金\" is a mistranslation and does not correspond to the original text. The term is unclear and likely a result of a keyboard error or misunderstanding.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"EFAC 已為 Exchange Fund 設定以下投資目標：\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains \"EFAC\" and correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term \"Exchange Fund\" is not translated into Chinese, which is not ideal for a formal document. It should be translated as \"外匯基金\" for clarity and consistency.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, use the correct terminology, and maintain a natural and formal tone. \"EFAC\" should be translated as \"香港儲備基金管理局\" (Hong Kong Reserve Fund Management Authority), and \"Exchange Fund\" should be translated as \"外匯基金.\" The sentence should be concise and avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**  \n香港儲備基金管理局已為外匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保有資本；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高流動性的美元計價資產支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；及  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以協助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n總體而言，各譯文在語意傳達上大致準確，但存在一些細節上的差異與可改進之處。以下為具體評析與改進建議：\n1. **術語一致性**：「Exchange Fund」應統一譯為「外匯基金」，但譯文3、4、6使用「儲備基金」或「交易所基金」，與原文不符，應修正。\n2. **「Backing Portfolio」與「Investment Portfolio」**：譯文1、2、3、4、5使用「backing組合」或「支持組合」，而譯文6使用「後備組合」，建議統一為「支持組合」或「Backing組合」，以符合官方用語。\n3. **「Currency Board arrangements」**：譯文1、2、3、4、6使用「聯繫匯率制度」，譯文5使用「貨幣發行局制度」，應統一為「聯繫匯率制度」，因這是香港的正式稱謂。\n4. **語句流暢度**：譯文1、2、3、4、5、6在語句結構上大致通順，但部分語句略顯生硬，如「以根據聯繫匯率安排」可調整為「以符合聯繫匯率制度的要求」，更符合中文語法。\n5. **文化與語境適應**：譯文應避免使用英文字母或非正式縮寫，如「OECD」應譯為「經濟合作及發展組織」，譯文1、2、3、4、5、6皆正確處理。\n6. **數字與比例表達**：譯文在數字與比例的表達上基本正確，但可進一步優化語句結構，使讀者更易理解。\n基於上述評析，最佳的翻譯應在語意準確、術語一致、語句流暢與文化適應方面達到平衡。\n外匯基金廣義而言設有兩個主要組合——支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有高流動性的美元計價資產，以符合聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩個組合整體的長期目標債券與股票配置比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更有效地管理風險並在中長期提升回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已以謹慎及逐步的方式，將部分發行基金的投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及物業投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。HKMA在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為發行基金累計結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私人股權為913億港元，物業投資為508億港元，未償投資承諾則達1,224億港元。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年成立，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金帳戶以戰略目的購入。由於該組合的特殊性質，因此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 準備金管理\n\n# 投資流程\n所有翻譯都正確地將 \"The investment process\" 翻譯為 \"投資流程\"，這是一個準確且自然的中文表達。然而，值得注意的是，所有翻譯在格式上都使用了 \"# 投資流程\" 或 \"投資流程\"，但原英文文本中使用了 \"# The investment process\" 的格式，其中 # 象徵標題或章節標記。\n在中文中，使用 # 來標示標題雖然在某些場合（如社交媒體或技術文件）中見得到，但在正式文件或傳統中文文本中，通常會使用更傳統的標題格式，例如使用「一、」、「二、」或「第一章」、「第二章」等。然而，若原英文文本的格式是為了強調標題，並希望在中文中保留相同的格式，使用 # 也是可以接受的。\n因此，最佳的翻譯應當保留原英文文本的格式，並使用 # 來標示標題，以保持一致性。此外，\"投資流程\" 是一個自然且符合傳統中文語法的翻譯，無需進一步修改。因此，最終的翻譯為：\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金根據其投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以試圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準（即策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準及戰術偏離的限制是由財政司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）磋商後決定，但戰術決策則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據授權作出。在戰術偏離所允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以根據短期市場走勢進行投資操作。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部的背書組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列組合，以及為基金實施宏觀風險管理策略而設的各種衍生工具疊加組合。\n\n# 外部經理的運用\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title, \"# Use of external managers,\" is a heading likely used in a formal or business context, possibly from a document discussing management practices or governance structures.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 外部經理的使用**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately conveys the literal meaning of \"use of external managers.\" The term \"外部經理\" is appropriate for \"external managers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"使用\" (\"use\") may be too direct and less formal than \"運用\" (\"application\" or \"utilization\"), which is more commonly used in formal or business contexts. The hashtag \"#\" is retained, which is acceptable if the format is to be preserved.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: # 外聘管理人員的使用**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"外聘\" (\"hired externally\") adds nuance, suggesting that these managers are not in-house but are hired from outside.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"管理人員\" (\"management personnel\") is broader than \"managers\" and may not be as precise. The use of \"使用\" again is less formal than \"運用.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: 外部管理人員的運用**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"運用\" which is more formal and appropriate for a business or governance context. \"外部管理人員\" is accurate for \"external managers.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag \"#\" is omitted, which may be important if the original format is to be preserved.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: # 外部管理機構的使用**  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"管理機構\" (\"management institution\") is incorrect; it refers to an organization or body, not individuals. This is a significant misinterpretation of the original term \"managers.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: # 使用外部經理人**  \n   - **Strengths:** Retains the hashtag and uses \"外部經理人\" (\"external manager\"), which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure \"使用外部經理人\" is less formal and slightly awkward compared to \"外部經理的運用.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: 外部經理的運用**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the most natural and formal phrasing, \"運用,\" and accurately translates \"external managers\" as \"外部經理.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits the hashtag \"#,\" which may be important for consistency with the original format.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, accurate, and preserve the original structure if necessary. \"外部經理的運用\" is the most natural and appropriate translation, using \"運用\" to convey the formal and strategic use of external managers. However, since the original includes a hashtag, it should be retained for consistency. Therefore, the improved translation should be: **# 外部經理的運用**. This version is both grammatically correct and culturally appropriate for a formal business or governance context.\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產。聘請外部基金管理機構的目的是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現多元化的投資風格組合，並把市場上的知識與資訊傳授給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費、托管費、交易成本，以及預扣稅及其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n所有翻譯版本在詞彙選擇上都正確，使用了「風險管理」與「合規」這兩組專業術語，符合金融或企業管理領域的常用表達。然而，從翻譯品質與語境適應性的角度來看，第四位翻譯者在標題前加上了「#」符號，與原文格式一致，這在現代文本（如報告、網頁標題或社交媒體標籤）中是常見的處理方式，因此更具格式對應性與視覺一致性。\n其他翻譯版本雖然語義正確，但未保留原文中的「#」符號，這可能導致格式不一致，特別是在需要與原文格式對應的場合（如技術文件、網站標題或報告章節標記）。因此，最佳的翻譯應當在語義準確的基礎上，同時保留原文的格式特徵，以確保專業性與一致性。\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監督其合規情況。風險控制工具被用於在正常及不利市場環境下評估市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內外資產管理人的投資專業能力。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND.\" The term \"Exchange Fund\" is critical here, and it is important to ensure that the translation accurately reflects the intended meaning. \nThe first, second, fifth, and fourth translations all use the term \"交易所基金表現,\" which is a direct and accurate translation of \"Performance of the Exchange Fund.\" The use of the hashtag (#) is preserved, which is appropriate if this is part of a heading or title in a document or report. The fourth translation adds \"的\" after \"交易所基金,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more verbose than necessary. However, it does not detract from the clarity.\nThe third translation, \"交易所基金績效,\" uses \"績效\" instead of \"表現.\" While both terms can be used to describe performance, \"績效\" is more commonly associated with \"performance\" in a business or financial context, particularly in reports or evaluations. However, \"表現\" is more general and can be used in a variety of contexts, including financial ones. Both are acceptable, but \"表現\" is more neutral and widely used in headings or titles.\nThe sixth translation, \"外匯基金的表現,\" uses \"外匯基金\" (foreign exchange fund) instead of \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund). This is a significant deviation from the original text. \"Exchange Fund\" is not the same as \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\" Unless the original text is referring specifically to a foreign exchange fund, which is not indicated, this translation is inaccurate.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct. However, the use of \"的\" in the fourth translation is optional and may be omitted for brevity, especially in headings or titles. The choice between \"表現\" and \"績效\" depends on the context and the intended tone. If the text is part of a formal report or financial document, \"績效\" may be more appropriate. However, if it is a general heading or title, \"表現\" is more natural and widely used.\nConsidering all these factors, the best translation would be a concise and accurate rendering that preserves the original meaning and tone. \"交易所基金表現\" is the most direct and natural translation, and it is used by the majority of the junior translators. It is concise, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate for a heading or title in a financial or business context.\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動劇烈，其中股市尤為突出，經歷了異常的動盪。主要股市在上半年創下新高，然而第三季因中國經濟增長擔憂，市場情緒急劇惡化，主要股市逆轉累計漲幅，錄得顯著季度虧損。其後隨市場情緒改善，全球股市有所復甦，但年底再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯動，2015年香港股市表現劣於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，各版本翻譯整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的經濟內容，語法也基本正確，但在用詞、語序、語氣及語感上仍有提升空間。以下為各版本的評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一版**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「主權債券市場」、「收益率」、「通縮壓力」等經濟術語使用得當。但「正面情緒」與「樂觀情緒」語意重複，可統一為「樂觀情緒」或「正面情緒」。\n2. **第二版**：語序較為自然，「短週期」一詞略顯不常見，建議改為「短期」。此外，「升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢」語感稍顯生硬，可調整為「地緣政治緊張局勢升溫」。\n3. **第三版**：語句流暢，用詞精準，如「殖利率」一詞較符合台灣用語習慣。但「地緣政治緊張局勢加劇」語序略顯笨重，可調整為「地緣政治緊張局勢加劇」。\n4. **第四版**：語句通順，但「短債」一詞不夠正式，建議改為「短期債券」。此外，「歸因於」語氣較為口語，建議改為「歸因於」或「由於」。\n5. **第五版**：用詞較為精準，如「殖利率」、「負利率區間」等。但「溫和上升」與「小幅上升」語意重複，建議統一為「小幅上升」或「溫和上升」。此外，「推動下」語序略顯不自然，建議改為「在……推動下」。\n6. **第六版**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「升息循環」、「通縮壓力揮之不去」等。但「激進貨幣寬鬆政策」語感稍顯強烈，建議改為「積極的貨幣寬鬆政策」。\n**改進建議**：在語序上，應更符合中文經濟報導的常見語序，如「儘管……，但……」、「因……，導致……」等。在用詞上，應統一術語，如「殖利率」或「收益率」、「通縮壓力」或「通貨緊縮壓力」等。此外，語氣應更正式、流暢，避免過於口語化或重複。\n---\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國將啟動利率正常化並進入利率上行週期，2015年美國長期國債收益率仍僅小幅上升，原因是樂觀情緒受到對全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的制約。另一方面，在歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策推動下，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下跌，部分甚至跌入負利率區間。\n\n在貨幣市場上，2015年美元持續走強，美元指數在美國政策利率正常化預期的推動下急升近10%。歐元在第一季度大幅走弱，創下自1999年歐元啟用以來最大的單季跌幅，原因是歐洲央行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日元在2015年對美元基本持平。\n\n表一顯示了2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。  \n二零一五年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現如表1所示。  \n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，請參閱表一。  \n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。  \n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。  \n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。  \n上述六種翻譯在語法和語意上均大致正確，但各有細節可優化。第一種翻譯語序自然，但「表一」與「如表1所示」的語法結構不一致，建議統一。第二種翻譯使用「二零一五年」與「表1」混用，風格不一致，且「股權市場」在中文語境中較少見，應使用「股票市場」。第三種翻譯語意清晰，但「請參閱」較為口語，與正式文本語境不完全契合。第四至第六種翻譯語法正確，但重複度高，缺乏變化。\n最佳翻譯應在語法正確、語意清晰、語體正式、風格統一的前提下，選擇最自然的表達方式。因此，建議採用「表一顯示了2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。」此句語序自然，語體正式，符合中文表達習慣，且與原文語意完全一致。\n表一顯示了2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n# 準備金管理\n\n# 香港儲備基金的表現\n\n在極度波動的金融市場及困難的投資環境下，2015年外匯基金錄得投資虧損158億港元，其中包括海外股票帶來的71億港元收益、香港股票造成的50億港元虧損、債券帶來的159億港元收益、非港元資產因貨幣翻譯效果產生的449億港元負面影響，以及基金投資控股子公司所持其他投資帶來的111億港元收益。由於去年美元大幅升值，在將外匯基金的非美元資產轉換為港元時，此負面貨幣翻譯效果無法避免。另外，戰略組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n外匯基金於2015年底的總資產達到3,4229億港元。扣除戰略組合後，外匯基金2015年的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金界相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂相對輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局近年已推出一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、提高現金持有比例，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化進程，特別是透過LTGP進行的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，並有助緩衝部分潛在損失。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年度回報詳見圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報為3.3%，自1994年以來的平均回報為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持倉。  \n2. 綜合消費者物價指數是根據以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算的。\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持倉。  \n2. 綜合消費者物價指數是根據以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算的。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese. The most common translations are \"# 企業功能\" and \"# 企業職能,\" with a few omitting the hashtag.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **\"企業功能\"** is a direct and commonly used translation for \"corporate functions.\" It is clear, concise, and appropriate in a business or organizational context. The term \"功能\" (function) is widely understood in this context and is often used in corporate documentation.\n- **\"企業職能\"** uses \"職能\" (duties or responsibilities), which is slightly more formal and can imply a broader range of roles or responsibilities within a corporation. While this is not incorrect, it may be less precise than \"功能\" when referring specifically to \"functions\" in a structural or operational sense.\n- The use of the hashtag \"#\" is consistent with the original text and is appropriate in contexts such as headings or titles. However, in some formal documents, the hashtag may be omitted depending on the style guide.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically correct. However, the repetition of similar translations (e.g., \"企業功能\" appearing multiple times) suggests a lack of diversity in the junior translators' approaches.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and culturally appropriate. \"企業功能\" is the most direct and natural translation of \"corporate functions\" in Traditional Chinese. It is widely used in business and corporate contexts and conveys the intended meaning clearly. The hashtag \"#\" is retained to match the original format, unless the context explicitly requires its omission.\nTherefore, the improved translation is:\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安，以及重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以改善公司治理，並應對因新計劃和系統的實施以及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社區 企業發展\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English phrase \"ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\" appears to be a heading or title, likely for a section or initiative related to corporate social responsibility or community involvement in business development. The phrase is somewhat ambiguous in structure, but it can be interpreted as \"Engaging the Community in Corporate Development\" or \"Community Engagement in Corporate Development.\"\nNow, reviewing the translations:\n1. **# 參與社區 企業發展** – This translation is clear and uses standard vocabulary. The use of “參與” (participate) and “社區” (community) is appropriate. However, the structure “企業發展” (corporate development) is slightly awkward as a direct translation of “corporate development.” It may be better to use “企業發展” as a noun phrase, but the spacing between “社區” and “企業發展” could be improved for clarity.\n2. **社區參與企業發展** – This translation is concise but lacks the hashtag symbol, which may be important for formatting. The phrase “社區參與企業發展” is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in structure. It reads as “Community participates in corporate development,” which is not the most natural phrasing in Chinese.\n3. **# 呼應社區 企業發展** – The use of “呼應” (respond to) is less common in this context and may not convey the intended meaning of “engaging” or “participating.” It may be more appropriate to use “參與” or “參與社區” instead.\n4. **社群參與 企業發展** – This is a natural and fluent translation. “社群” is a slightly more modern and inclusive term than “社區,” which is appropriate for a corporate context. The spacing between “社群參與” and “企業發展” is well-structured and conveys the intended meaning clearly.\n5. **參與社群企業發展** – This translation is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. The phrase “參與社群企業發展” could be misinterpreted as “participating in community corporate development,” which is not the intended meaning. The structure is unclear and may confuse the reader.\n6. **# 參與社區企業發展** – This is a concise and clear translation. The hashtag is included, and the phrase “參與社區企業發展” is grammatically correct. However, the lack of spacing between “社區” and “企業發展” may make it slightly less readable.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, clear, and natural in Traditional Chinese. It should include the hashtag if it is part of the original formatting. The term “社群” is more modern and inclusive than “社區,” which is appropriate for a corporate context. The phrase “參與社群企業發展” is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. A better structure would be “參與社群 企業發展” with a space between the two phrases to improve readability.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# 參與社群 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及增進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。2015年，共舉辦了59項公開傳媒活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場即席訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，還安排了43次傳媒訪問，發佈了325份中英文新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局分別組織了兩次媒體參觀活動，帶領媒體前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界一流的紙幣印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時，亦舉辦了有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育研討會，為媒體提供更深入的簡報，以加深其對這些重要主題的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中）及貨幣管理執行董事李惠來（右），在媒體參觀香港印鈔有限公司期間檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在媒體參觀香港國際商業信貸銀行（HKICL）期間，進行了自動化支票分類的示範。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳德棣先生、金融基礎設施執行董事李奕明先生，以及香港國際商業信貸銀行首席執行官唐麗嫦女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese.

It uses \"圖表\" for \"Chart\" and \"公眾查詢總數\" for \"Total number of public enquiries.\" The spacing between \"圖表\" and \"1\" is consistent with common usage in Chinese technical documents.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"圖表 1 公眾諮詢總數\" – This version uses \"諮詢\" instead of \"查詢.\" While both terms are related, \"諮詢\" implies a more formal or advisory type of inquiry, whereas \"查詢\" is more general and commonly used for \"enquiries\" in administrative or statistical contexts. This is a minor but meaningful difference in nuance.\n3. **Translation 3:** Identical to Translation 1, so it shares the same strengths and weaknesses.\n4. **Translation 4:** Identical to Translation 1, so it shares the same strengths and weaknesses.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"圖表 1：公眾查詢總數\" – This version uses a colon after the chart number, which is a stylistic choice. While not incorrect, it is less common in formal or statistical contexts, where a space or no punctuation is preferred.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"圖一 公共諮詢總數\" – This uses \"圖一\" instead of \"圖表1,\" which is less standard in formal contexts. \"圖表\" is more precise for \"Chart.\" Also, \"公共諮詢\" uses \"公共\" (public) instead of \"公眾\" (public, general public), which is slightly less idiomatic in this context.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- \"圖表\" is more precise and standard for \"Chart\" in formal contexts.\n- \"公眾查詢\" is more accurate than \"公共諮詢\" for \"public enquiries.\"\n- The use of a colon or space after the chart number is a matter of style, but in formal documents, a space is more common.\n- Consistency in spacing and terminology is important for clarity and professionalism.\n**Best Translation:**\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局（HKMA）年度報告外，香港金融管理局過去一年亦發佈了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》、四期《季刊通訊》，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新及主題性資訊與分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇《洞見》文章，涵蓋各類具時效性及重要性的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年度報告在香港管理協會2015年度最佳年報獎的「非牟利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過50,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的「授權機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊」及「授權機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例設立的「儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊」。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引導公眾關注重要及時資訊，例如提醒市民提高警惕，防止詐騙電話，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車的位置等資訊。\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese.

The term \"功能\" (function) is widely understood in this context and is often used in corporate documentation.\n- **\"企業職能\"** uses \"職能\" (duties or responsibilities), which is slightly more formal and can imply a broader range of roles or responsibilities within a corporation. While this is not incorrect, it may be less precise than \"功能\" when referring specifically to \"functions\" in a structural or operational sense.\n- The use of the hashtag \"#\" is consistent with the original text and is appropriate in contexts such as headings or titles. However, in some formal documents, the hashtag may be omitted depending on the style guide.\n- The translations are generally fluent and grammatically correct. However, the repetition of similar translations (e.g., \"企業功能\" appearing multiple times) suggests a lack of diversity in the junior translators' approaches.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and culturally appropriate. \"企業功能\" is the most direct and natural translation of \"corporate functions\" in Traditional Chinese. It is widely used in business and corporate contexts and conveys the intended meaning clearly. The hashtag \"#\" is retained to match the original format, unless the context explicitly requires its omission.\nTherefore, the improved translation is:\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公共教育計畫\n審視各譯本後，可發現主要差異在於標點符號與用詞選擇。原文為「Public education programme」，其中「programme」在英式英語中常用，但在翻譯成中文時，「計畫」與「項目」皆可接受，但「計畫」更符合中文語境中對長期性、系統性教育政策的表述。此外，「公眾教育」與「公共教育」語意相近，但「公眾教育」更強調面向大眾的教育活動，與「public education」的語意更貼切。\n在標點符號方面，原文有「#」符號，此為標題符號，但在中文中並非常用標點，因此是否保留需視語境而定。若為正式文件或標題，可保留「#」符號；若為一般文本，則可省略。\n綜合考量語意準確性、語境適切性與語法規範，「公共教育計畫」為最合適的翻譯。此譯本語意明確，符合中文語法，且無冗餘或不當用詞。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社區介紹金管局工作、提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天。展覽區介紹金管局的工作，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展歷程，並提供相關閱讀資料及展品，供公眾研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導覽服務。在過去一年中，該中心接待了超過四萬八千三百名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過六百三十場導覽活動（見圖表3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過五十三萬零四百人次造訪資訊中心。\n\n位於展覽區旁的圖書館收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，專門用於深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，維護香港授權機構的電子登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動社區接觸計劃，並繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦三場講座，約有2,300名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用以及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，參與人數已超過54,700人。\n\n圖3 資訊中心團體參訪類型\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"Chart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre.\" The goal is to translate this title accurately and naturally into Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"圖3 訪問資訊中心的團體訪問類型\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately conveys the meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"訪問資訊中心的團體訪問類型\" is slightly redundant and awkward in structure. The repetition of \"訪問\" (visit) is unnecessary and makes the phrase feel wordy.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表三：資訊中心團體參觀類型\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖表三\" (Chart 3) and \"團體參觀類型\" (types of group visits) effectively.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"圖表三\" is slightly more formal than \"圖3,\" which may not be ideal for a title. Also, \"參觀\" (visit) is slightly more formal than \"參訪\" or \"訪問.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表 3 資訊中心團體訪問類型\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"圖表\" is slightly more formal than \"圖,\" and \"訪問\" is less natural than \"參訪\" in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖3 資訊中心各類團體參訪\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖3\" and \"參訪\" (visit), which is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"各類團體參訪\" is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as \"various types of group visits,\" but the structure is not as clear as \"團體參訪類型.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表3 走訪資訊中心的群組類型\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖表3\" and \"走訪\" (visit).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"群組\" (group) is not the best term for \"group visits\" in this context. It implies a \"group\" in a more technical or digital sense, which is not appropriate here.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖表3 資訊中心團體參觀類型\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Similar to the second translation, \"圖表\" is slightly more formal than \"圖.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and accurately reflect the original meaning. \"圖3\" is more commonly used in titles than \"圖表3,\" and \"參訪\" is a more natural and commonly used term for \"visit\" in this context. \"團體參訪類型\" is clear and concise, avoiding redundancy and awkward phrasing. Therefore, the improved translation is:  \n**圖3 資訊中心團體參訪類型**\n\n年輕訪客在資訊中心的導覽行程中，學習香港貨幣與銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n高中學生與教師參與公共教育研討會。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is: \"Secondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\"\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the sentence, but they vary in terms of fluency, vocabulary choice, and cultural appropriateness.\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"高中學生與教師參與公共教育研討會\" – this is accurate and natural. \"高中\" is a common term for \"secondary school\" in Chinese, and \"研討會\" is the standard term for \"seminar.\" The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"中學學生與教師參與公開教育研討會\" – \"中學\" is also acceptable for \"secondary school,\" but \"公開\" (public) is slightly less precise than \"公共\" (public, as in public education). \"公開\" can imply \"open\" or \"publicly available,\" which may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"public education.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"中學師生參與公眾教育研討會\" – this is concise and natural. \"師生\" is a common term for \"students and teachers.\" However, \"公眾教育\" is slightly less standard than \"公共教育\" in the context of education policy or public education initiatives.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"中學學生和教師參與公共教育講座\" – \"講座\" (lecture) is not the same as \"seminar.\" A \"seminar\" typically involves discussion and interaction, while a \"lecture\" is more one-way. This is a minor but meaningful difference in meaning.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"中學生和老師參加了一場公眾教育研討會\" – this is grammatically correct but slightly more colloquial. \"參加了一場\" adds a sense of a specific event, which may not be necessary unless the original sentence implies a specific instance.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"中學生和老師參加公眾教育研討會\" – this is very similar to Translation 5 but omits the \"了一場,\" making it more general and closer to the original sentence's tone.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and use standard terminology. \"高中學生與教師參與公共教育研討會\" (Translation 1) is the most accurate and natural, using standard terms for \"secondary school students and teachers\" and \"public education seminar.\" It avoids unnecessary words and maintains the formal tone appropriate for a public education context.\n**Final Translation:**\n高中學生與教師參與公共教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培養並維持一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它能夠以與公務員制度不同的條件聘僱員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡而靈活的架構，並重新配置人力資源，以推動新計劃及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動說明\n所有翻譯版本都正確地將「Organisational changes」翻譯為「組織變更」或「組織變動」，這兩個詞在語義上非常接近，都能準確傳達「組織結構或人事方面的調整」之意。然而，從語感與語境適應性的角度來看，「變動」比「變更」更具動態與靈活的語感，更符合「changes」所帶有的持續性與多樣性特質。\n此外，所有翻譯版本都保留了原文的標題格式（即以「#」開頭），這在現代企業文件或報告中非常常見，有助於資訊的分層與閱讀。然而，值得注意的是，若此標題是用於正式文件或官方公告中，可能需要根據具體語境調整格式，例如使用更正式的標題格式或去除標點符號。\n綜合考量語義準確性、語感自然度與格式適應性，「組織變動」是較為優越的選擇，且保留「#」符號可維持與原文一致的格式風格。因此，最佳的翻譯應為：\n# 組織變動\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年12月根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的實施，在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監察部，以履行金管局在儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的發牌及日常監管方面的法定職責。為加強部門間的協調，並重新配置人力資源以應對新措施實施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和工作複雜性，金管局於2015年已計劃進行若干部門職務的重組，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）從執法部（ENFD）及貨幣管理部門（MMD）接管了存款保障計劃的管理職能與結算功能，並從銀行部門接掌了與銀行業相關的工作，包括消費者教育、董事發展及銀行從業人員的能力建構框架。\n\n外部部門接管了MMD的市場開發職能，而後者將繼續處理與財政市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；\n\n金融穩定局（ENFD）從銀行監理部門接掌反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法及反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese.

It is a list item or part of a larger sentence, likely followed by another item. The key elements to translate are \"enhancing\", \"consumer protection\", \"consumer education efforts\", and the semicolon followed by \"and\".\n**Translation Analysis:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"加強\" for \"enhancing\", and \"消費者保護及消費者教育工作\" for \"consumer protection and consumer education efforts\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"以及\" at the end is grammatically incorrect in this context. \"以及\" is used to introduce a list item, but it should not be used after a semicolon in this structure.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；並\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure is correct with \"並\" following the semicolon, which is appropriate for continuing a list.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"消費者教育工作\" is slightly less precise than \"消費者教育努力\" in capturing the nuance of \"efforts\".\n3. **Third junior translator:** Same as the second, so the same evaluation applies.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Same as the first, so the same evaluation applies.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"加強消費者保護及消費者教育努力；以及\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"努力\" for \"efforts\", which is more precise than \"工作\".  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, the use of \"以及\" is incorrect in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"加強消費者保護與消費者教育的力度；並\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"與\" instead of \"及\", which is also acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"的力度\" is not a direct translation of \"efforts\" and may be confusing. It implies \"intensity\" rather than \"efforts\".\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"加強\" for \"enhancing\", \"消費者保護及消費者教育努力\" to capture \"consumer protection and consumer education efforts\", and \"並\" after the semicolon to continue the list. \"以及\" is not appropriate here, and \"的力度\" is not a direct or natural translation of \"efforts\".\nThus, the best translation is:  \n**加強消費者保護及消費者教育努力；並**\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及CNH市場發展情況的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金設立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的擴展投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在日益嚴峻的投資環境下，提升策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the junior translators have provided several variations in Traditional Chinese. The most common translations are \"# 企業功能\" and \"# 企業職能,\" with a few omitting the hashtag.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **\"企業功能\"** is a direct and commonly used translation for \"corporate functions.\" It is clear, concise, and appropriate in a business or organizational context. The term \"功能\" (function) is widely understood in this context and is often used in corporate documentation.\n- **\"企業職能\"** uses \"職能\" (duties or responsibilities), which is slightly more formal and can imply a broader range of roles or responsibilities within a corporation. While this is not incorrect, it may be less precise than \"功能\" when referring specifically to \"functions\" in a structural or operational sense.\n- The use of the hashtag \"#\" is consistent with the original text and is appropriate in contexts such as headings or titles.

However, the repetition of similar translations (e.g., \"企業功能\" appearing multiple times) suggests a lack of diversity in the junior translators' approaches.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and culturally appropriate. \"企業功能\" is the most direct and natural translation of \"corporate functions\" in Traditional Chinese. It is widely used in business and corporate contexts and conveys the intended meaning clearly.

Also, the use of a hashtag (#) is unnecessary unless the text is intended for a digital or social media context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"薪酬\" which is more precise and commonly used in HR and corporate contexts. The repetition of \"薪酬\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is unnecessary, and the repetition of \"薪酬\" may be seen as stylistically awkward.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the precise term \"薪酬\" and correctly translates \"pay review mechanism\" as \"薪酬審查機制.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The repetition of \"薪酬\" is slightly redundant, though not incorrect.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"# 紅利政策與薪資審查機制\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"薪資審查機制\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"紅利\" translates to \"dividends\" or \"bonus,\" which is not equivalent to \"remuneration\" in the context of employment policies.

The use of \"及\" (and) is slightly more formal than \"與,\" but still acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"審核\" is slightly more formal than \"審查,\" which may be acceptable depending on context, but \"審查\" is more commonly used in HR policies.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"薪酬政策與薪資檢討機制\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"薪酬\" and \"薪資檢討機制\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"檢討\" is more commonly used in the context of reviewing or evaluating policies, but it may be slightly less precise than \"審查\" in the context of a formal review mechanism.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"薪酬\" for \"remuneration\" as it is the most precise and commonly used term in HR and corporate contexts. \"薪資審查機制\" is the most accurate and natural translation of \"pay review mechanism.\" The use of \"與\" is more natural in this context than \"及\" or \"檢討.\" The hashtag is unnecessary unless the text is intended for a digital or social media context, which is not indicated here.\nTherefore, the best translation is:  \n**薪酬政策與薪資審查機制**\n\n財政司司長（FS）會根據治理小組委員會（GSC）的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及強積金計劃，實物福利極少。現金薪酬包由每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪金組成，變動薪金會根據員工表現，每年以一次性形式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬每年由財政司司長（FS）根據公務員薪酬委員會（GSC）透過職位評估常設委員會（EFAC）提出的建議進行審核，並會考慮GSC對HKMA上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構對金融界薪酬的調查結果，以及其他任何相關因素。為維持員工薪酬的競爭力，有需要時或會針對個別表現卓越的員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現發放給個別員工。香港金融管理局（HKMA）的投資專業人員適用變動薪酬制度，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。職級為執行董事或以上的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，由財政司（FS）根據治理與戰略委員會（GSC）的建議批准，有關員工在討論其薪酬的會議上並不在場。職級為部門主管或以下的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局首席執行官根據財政司授予的權力，在經批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告  \n外匯基金財務報表\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a formal title: \"Report of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements.\" It appears to be the title of a document, likely from a government or financial institution, and should be translated with precision and formality.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"審計署署長報告 投資基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately translates \"Director of Audit\" as \"審計署署長\" and \"Financial Statements\" as \"財務報表.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Investment Fund\" is not the same as \"Exchange Fund.\" The term \"投資基金\" is misleading and does not match the original.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"稽核長報告 交換基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"交換基金\" correctly translates \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"稽核長\" is not the standard term for \"Director of Audit.\" It is more commonly used for \"Auditor General\" or \"Chief Auditor,\" not \"Director of Audit.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"審計主任報告 儲備基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"審計主任\" is a plausible translation for \"Director of Audit.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"儲備基金\" translates to \"Reserve Fund,\" which is not the same as \"Exchange Fund.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"審計主任報告 外匯基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"審計主任\" is a reasonable translation for \"Director of Audit,\" and \"外匯基金\" correctly translates \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"審計主任\" is less commonly used in official titles compared to \"審計署署長.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"審計署署長報告 交換基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"審計署署長\" is the most standard and formal term for \"Director of Audit,\" and \"交換基金\" is a direct translation of \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"交換基金\" is not the most commonly used term in financial contexts for \"Exchange Fund.\" \"外匯基金\" is more standard.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"稽核長報告 交換基金財務報表\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"交換基金\" is correct for \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"稽核長\" is not the standard term for \"Director of Audit.\"\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**  \nThe most accurate and natural translation would use \"審計署署長\" for \"Director of Audit\" and \"外匯基金\" for \"Exchange Fund.\" These terms are standard in official and financial contexts in Traditional Chinese. The title should be concise and formal, with appropriate spacing between the two parts of the title. Thus, the best translation is:\n**審計署署長報告  \n外匯基金財務報表**\n\n# 審計主任報告書\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is \"# Report of the Director of Audit.\" The goal is to translate this into a natural and appropriate Traditional Chinese title.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"審計主任報告書\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This translation is accurate and natural. \"報告書\" (report) is the standard term for a formal report, and \"審計主任\" (Director of Audit) is a direct and appropriate translation of \"Director of Audit.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. It is a well-constructed title.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"審計署署長報告\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The term \"審計署\" (Audit Office) is a common institutional name in Chinese government contexts.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"署長\" (Director of an Office) is not the exact equivalent of \"Director of Audit.\" It implies a different administrative structure and may be misleading in contexts where the Audit Office is not the primary entity.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"審計處長報告\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"處長\" (Head of a Department) is a common term in Chinese administrative titles.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"審計處\" (Audit Department) is not the standard term for the office of the Director of Audit. It may be too narrow or not widely recognized in official contexts.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"審計主任報告\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** This is concise and accurate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It lacks the word \"書\" (book\/report), which is commonly used in formal titles to denote a document or report. This may make it seem less formal or incomplete.\n5. **Translation by the fifth and sixth junior translators: \"稽核長報告\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"稽核\" is a synonym for \"audit\" and is used in some contexts.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"稽核長\" is not the standard term for \"Director of Audit\" in official government or corporate contexts. It may be more commonly used in accounting or auditing jargon rather than in formal reports.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation is \"審計主任報告書.\" It uses the standard term \"審計主任\" for \"Director of Audit\" and \"報告書\" for \"Report,\" which is the conventional format for formal documents in Traditional Chinese. It is concise, clear, and culturally appropriate for official use. Other translations either use less standard terms or omit key components that are expected in formal titles.\n\n# 審計委員會  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其子公司（「集團」）於第134至222頁所載之財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及集團於2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出表、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要及其他說明資訊。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n審查與分析：\n1. 第一位翻譯者使用「財政局」，此詞在中文中通常指負責國家財政事務的機構，與「Monetary Authority」（貨幣當局）語義不符，因此不準確。\n2. 第二位翻譯者使用「貨幣當局」，語義準確，但標題前未加「#」符號，與原文格式不一致。\n3. 第三位翻譯者同樣使用「貨幣當局」，語義準確，但未使用標題符號「#」，格式與原文不一致。\n4. 第四位翻譯者使用「金融管理局」，此詞語在中文中較常見於具體機構名稱（如「香港金融管理局」），用作一般性「Monetary Authority」的翻譯略顯不夠精準。\n5. 第五位翻譯者與第二位相同，使用「貨幣當局」，語義準確，但未使用標題符號「#」。\n6. 第六位翻譯者使用「金融監管機構」，此詞語偏重於監管職能，與「Monetary Authority」的廣義涵蓋範圍不完全一致，語義略顯偏差。\n總結：「貨幣當局」是最準確的翻譯，符合「Monetary Authority」的語義，且在中文語境中使用自然。為保持與原文格式一致，應在標題前加上「#」符號。\n最佳翻譯：# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並建立貨幣管理局認為必要之內部控制機制，以確保財務報表無因欺詐或錯誤所致的重大錯報。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計時，遵循行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條所發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃及執行審計工作，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得財務報表中金額及披露事項的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大錯報風險的評估，無論該風險是源自舞弊或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合當前情況的審計程序，但並非用以對實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計亦包括評估會計政策的適當性及相關機構所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈報方式。\n審計涉及執行程序以取得財務報表中金額及披露事項的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大錯報風險的評估，無論該風險是源自舞弊或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合當前情況的審計程序，但並非用以對實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計亦包括評估會計政策的適當性及相關機構所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈報方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據已經足夠且適當，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告（續）\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文在基本語義上均能傳達「Director of Audit」的職務性質，但用詞與語境適切性存在差異。以下為各譯文評析：\n1. **審計長報告（續）**：用詞簡潔明確，符合官方文件常見標題格式，語感自然，為最佳選擇。\n2. **稽核長報告（續）**：「稽核」一詞較偏向財務審查或內部監督，與「Audit」的廣義審計職務略有差異，可能引起語義混淆。\n3. **審計署署長報告（續）**：過於具體，暗示「審計署」為特定機構，而原文未明確提及機構名稱，可能造成資訊冗餘。\n4. **審計長報告書（續）**：「報告書」一詞較偏向正式文件，與「Report」語感略有差異，且「報告書」在中文官方文件中較少用於標題。\n5. **審計處處長報告（續）**：與第3點類似，過於具體，且「處長」一詞在中文行政體系中較常見於地方政府，與「Director」的職務層級不完全對應。\n6. **審計主任報告（續）**：「主任」一詞在中文中較常見於非政府機構或企業職務，與「Director of Audit」的官方職務語境不完全契合。\n**改進方向：**  \n應選擇最符合「Director of Audit」職務稱謂、語境自然、符合官方文件標題慣例的譯法。因此，「審計長報告（續）」為最佳選擇，語義準確、語感自然，符合中文官方文件的標題風格。\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人認為，財務報表真實而公允地反映了截至2015年12月31日交易所基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港財務報告準則妥善編製，且符合行政長官根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所頒佈的指示。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n審計總監是較常見的職稱翻譯，用於表示Director of Audit。姓名「David Sun」在中文中通常譯為「孫大衛」，符合中文姓名的語序。此外，職稱與姓名之間的排版也較為自然，符合中文的書寫習慣。其他翻譯雖有可取之處，但「審計總監」在語意與語境上更為準確與自然。\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n入境事務大樓  \n告士威道7號  \n香港灣仔\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate but uses \"移民局大樓\" (Immigration Bureau Building), which is not the standard term for \"Immigration Tower.\" The term \"移民局\" typically refers to the Immigration Department, not a tower. Also, \"格洛斯特道\" is correct, but the address format is slightly awkward.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses \"移民大樓\" (Immigration Building), which is closer to the intended meaning, but \"Gloucester Road 7號\" is not standard in Chinese address formatting. The order should be \"7 Gloucester Road\" as \"告士威道7號.\" Also, \"灣仔，香港\" is correct but could be more natural as \"香港灣仔.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** uses \"入境大廈\" (Immigration Tower), which is accurate, but \"九 Gloucester Road\" is a clear error. It should be \"告士威道7號.\" Also, the address format is slightly off.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses \"審計署\" (Audit Office) instead of \"審計委員會\" (Audit Commission), which is a significant deviation from the original. The address is correctly ordered, but the title is incorrect.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is mostly accurate, using \"入境事務大樓\" (Immigration Affairs Building) and \"告士威道7號.\" However, \"Gloucester 道\" is not standard in Chinese; it should be \"告士威道.\" Also, \"香港灣仔區\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses \"移民塔\" (Immigration Tower), which is not standard. \"格洛斯特街\" is incorrect; it should be \"告士威道.\" The address format is also inconsistent.\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should use the correct title \"審計委員會,\" the standard term for \"Immigration Tower\" is \"入境事務大樓,\" and the street name should be \"告士威道7號.\" The address format in Chinese typically lists the building first, followed by the street and district. Therefore, the improved translation should be concise, accurate, and follow standard Chinese address conventions.\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入支出表  \n綜合收益表  \n資產負債表  \n股東權益變動表  \n現金流量表  \n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務活動  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別  \n7. 現金及隨時可動用資金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構  \n9. 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合營企業權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 房產、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣  \n21. 銀行體系餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存放款項  \n23. 財政儲備存放款項  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放款項  \n25. 發行的外匯基金債券及票據  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他發行債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 業務分部資訊  \n32. 質押資產  \n33. 承諾事項  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 金融風險管理  \n37. 金融工具公允價值計量  \n38. 財務報表日後非調整事項  \n39. 2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效之修訂、新準則及解釋可能影響  \n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Exchange Fund – Income and Expenditure Account.\" This is a formal title, likely used in financial or governmental contexts. The goal is to translate it into fluent, natural Traditional Chinese while preserving its formal tone and precise meaning.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"# 財政儲備基金 – 收支帳戶\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The term \"財政儲備基金\" (fiscal reserve fund) is a plausible interpretation of \"Exchange Fund\" in certain contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"財政儲備基金\" is not a standard or commonly used term for \"Exchange Fund\" in official or financial contexts. It may be misleading or inaccurate. \"收支帳戶\" is acceptable but slightly informal compared to \"收入及支出帳戶.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"# 外匯基金 – 收支帳戶\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"外匯基金\" (foreign exchange fund) is a direct and accurate translation of \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"收支帳戶\" is slightly informal and less precise than \"收入及支出帳戶.\" The use of the hash symbol \"#\" is appropriate for a title.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"# 結匯基金 – 收入及支出帳目\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"收入及支出帳目\" is a more formal and precise term than \"收支帳戶.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"結匯基金\" (conversion fund) is not a standard term for \"Exchange Fund.\" It may be confusing or inaccurate in this context.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is a clean, accurate, and formal translation. \"外匯基金\" is correct, and \"收入及支出帳戶\" is precise and formal.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The absence of the hash symbol \"#\" may be inconsistent with the original formatting, depending on the context.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"交換基金 – 收支帳戶\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The structure is correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"交換基金\" (exchange fund) is a literal translation but not commonly used in official contexts. It may be ambiguous or misleading.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"# 储備基金 – 收入及支出賬戶\"  \n   - **Strengths:** \"收入及支出賬戶\" is a formal and precise term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"儲備基金\" (reserve fund) is not the standard term for \"Exchange Fund.\" The use of \"賬戶\" (account) with a simplified character is not appropriate in Traditional Chinese.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the standard and commonly accepted term for \"Exchange Fund,\" which is \"外匯基金\" (foreign exchange fund). It should also use the formal and precise term \"收入及支出帳戶\" (income and expenditure account) rather than the more informal \"收支帳戶.\" The use of the hash symbol \"#\" is appropriate for a title, as seen in the original English text.\nTherefore, the most accurate and natural translation is:  \n**# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶**\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase \"for the year ended 31 December 2015\" is a standard financial reporting expression, commonly used in annual reports, financial statements, and legal documents. The goal of the translation is to convey the same meaning in natural, fluent, and culturally appropriate Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This translation is accurate and uses the standard financial terminology. The phrase \"截至...止年度\" is commonly used in Chinese financial contexts to denote the end of a fiscal year.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. It is concise and appropriate.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This version uses the full Chinese characters for numbers (二零一五), which is more formal and often used in official or legal documents.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** While correct, it is slightly more verbose than necessary for most contexts. It may be preferred in formal or official settings but is not the most concise option.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It is concise and avoids the word \"截至,\" which is optional in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The omission of \"截至\" may be slightly less clear to readers unfamiliar with the structure, though it is still understandable.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is identical to the first translation and is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日的年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"的\" instead of \"止\" is less common in financial contexts and may sound slightly less formal or precise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is identical to the first and fourth translations and is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe phrase \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\" is the most natural and standard translation in financial and legal contexts.

It may be preferred in formal or official settings but is not the most concise option.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It is concise and avoids the word \"截至,\" which is optional in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The omission of \"截至\" may be slightly less clear to readers unfamiliar with the structure, though it is still understandable.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is identical to the first translation and is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日的年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** It is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"的\" instead of \"止\" is less common in financial contexts and may sound slightly less formal or precise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is identical to the first and fourth translations and is accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe phrase \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\" is the most natural and standard translation in financial and legal contexts. It is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the standard structure \"截至...止年度\" which is widely recognized in Chinese financial reporting. While the second translation is also correct and may be preferred in more formal or official documents, the first and fourth translations are more universally applicable and concise. The fifth translation, while understandable, is less idiomatic in this context.\nTherefore, the best translation is:  \n**截至2015年12月31日止年度**\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase \"for the year ended 31 December 2015\" is a standard financial reporting expression, commonly used in annual reports, financial statements, and legal documents. The goal of the translation is to convey the same meaning in natural, fluent, and culturally appropriate Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"截至2015年12月31日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This translation is accurate and uses the standard financial terminology. The phrase \"截至...止年度\" is commonly used in Chinese financial contexts to denote the end of a fiscal year.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. It is concise and appropriate.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This version uses the full Chinese characters for numbers (二零一五), which is more formal and often used in official or legal documents.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** While correct, it is slightly more verbose than necessary for most contexts.

While the second translation is also correct and may be preferred in more formal or official documents, the first and fourth translations are more universally applicable and concise. The fifth translation, while understandable, is less idiomatic in this context.\nTherefore, the best translation is:  \n**截至2015年12月31日止年度**\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original English text is \"# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements.\" The goal is to translate this title accurately and appropriately into Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"財政儲備 – 財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The term \"財政儲備\" (fiscal reserve) is a common and appropriate translation for \"Exchange Fund\" in certain contexts, especially when referring to government funds. The second part \"財務報表附註\" is accurate for \"Notes to the Financial Statements.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"財政儲備\" may not be the most precise term for \"Exchange Fund,\" which typically refers to a specific type of fund used for currency exchange or foreign exchange management.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"儲備基金 – 財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"儲備基金\" (reserve fund) is a direct and commonly used term in financial contexts.\n   - **Weaknesses:** While \"reserve fund\" is a general term, it may not fully capture the specific nature of an \"Exchange Fund,\" which is often associated with foreign exchange or monetary policy.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"交換基金 – 財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"交換基金\" (exchange fund) is a direct translation of \"Exchange Fund.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** The term \"交換基金\" is not commonly used in formal financial reporting in Traditional Chinese, and may be confusing or less standard compared to other terms.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"匯豐基金－財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The second part is accurate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"匯豐基金\" (HSBC Fund) is clearly a mistranslation, as it refers to a specific bank, not a general \"Exchange Fund.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"外匯基金\" (foreign exchange fund) is a precise and commonly used term in financial contexts, especially in government or central bank reporting.\n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong and accurate translation.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"投資基金 – 財務報表附註\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** The second part is accurate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"投資基金\" (investment fund) is not appropriate for \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not primarily an investment vehicle.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe most accurate and contextually appropriate translation is \"外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\" (Foreign Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements). This term is widely recognized in financial and governmental contexts, and it precisely captures the nature of an \"Exchange Fund\" as a fund related to foreign exchange management. It is also grammatically correct and culturally appropriate in Traditional Chinese financial reporting.\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）管理人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護港元的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整。\n\n基金的資產被劃分為四個投資組合：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。後備組合的資產完全對應香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合則持有香港特別行政區政府（HKSAR）為基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。營運部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2. 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個統稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註三載列本集團於本及過往會計期間內因首次採用這些準則而導致的會計政策變動（如有），且這些變動與本財務報表所反映的會計期間相關。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表之編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，惟下列資產及負債係按其公允價值列示，詳情請參閱下文所述之會計政策。\n\n交易金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；  \n按公允價值計量且其變動計入當期損益的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；  \n可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；  \n黃金（附註2.11）；及  \n投資性不動產（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的應用，以及資產、負債、收入及費用的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設基於經驗及其他在當時情況下認為合理的因素，其結果構成了評估資產及負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非可從其他來源直接得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行審查。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響當期，則應於該期間確認；若同時影響當期及未來期間，則應於修訂當期及未來期間確認。\nThe original English text discusses the ongoing review of estimates and assumptions, and the recognition of changes to accounting estimates in the appropriate periods. The junior translators have all captured the general meaning, but there are differences in fluency, terminology, and structure.\nTranslation 1 is clear and grammatically correct, but uses \"確認\" (confirm) which may not be the most precise term in an accounting context. \"認列\" (recognize) is more commonly used in financial reporting.\nTranslation 2 is fluent and uses \"確認\" consistently, but the structure is slightly repetitive and could be more concise.\nTranslation 3 is concise and uses \"認列\" appropriately, but the sentence structure is a bit fragmented.\nTranslation 4 is very similar to Translation 2, with a slightly more natural flow, but still uses \"確認\" instead of \"認列.\"\nTranslation 5 is concise and uses \"認列\" correctly, but the phrasing \"於估計調整期認列\" is slightly awkward.\nTranslation 6 is the most detailed and precise, using \"確認\" in the correct context and clearly distinguishing between the two scenarios. However, it is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\nThe best translation should use \"認列\" for \"recognised\" as it is the standard term in accounting. It should also be concise, grammatically correct, and maintain the logical structure of the original text. The final translation provided above achieves this by using precise terminology, maintaining clarity, and ensuring that the meaning is accurately conveyed in natural Traditional Chinese.\n\n附註18載有與投資性不動產公允價值評估相關的假設資訊。附註37載有與金融工具公允價值評估相關的假設資訊。除附註2.5所述某些金融工具的估值外，集團會計政策的應用中並未涉及任何關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是指由集團所控制的實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而暴露於或享有來自該實體的變動報酬，且能透過對該實體的控制權影響這些報酬。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司之投資，自取得控制權之日起至喪失控制權之日止，均併入本集團財務報表。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估這些翻譯時，我們需從語法、用詞、語流及專業準確性幾個方面進行分析。\n1. **第一譯文**使用了「按比例合併」，這與原句的「consolidated」不完全對應。原句並未提及「按比例」，因此此處為不必要的添加，可能導致誤解。\n2. **第二譯文**語法正確，但「自控制開始之日到控制結束之日」語氣較為口語，與財務文件的正式語境不完全契合。\n3. **第三譯文**語法正確，但「直至失去控制權之日止」中的「直至」與「至」語義重複，略顯累贅。\n4. **第四譯文**整體語法正確，用詞精準，語氣正式，符合財務文件的語境，是目前最接近原意的翻譯。\n5. **第五譯文**語法正確，但「會被合併至」中的「會被」語氣較為被動，與原句的主動語態不完全一致。\n6. **第六譯文**語法正確，但「均納入集團財務報表中合併」語序略顯混亂，「納入……中合併」結構不夠自然。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保語法正確，語序自然。\n- 使用正式、專業的財務術語。\n- 避免添加原句中未提及的資訊（如「按比例」）。\n- 確保語氣與財務文件的正式語境一致。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n對子公司之投資，自取得控制權之日起至喪失控制權之日止，均併入本集團財務報表。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內部的往來餘額、交易及現金流量，以及由此產生的未實現利潤及虧損，均將全部予以抵銷。\n\n非控制權益指子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未另行達成任何條款，導致集團整體對該等權益負有契約義務，而該義務符合財務負債的定義。非控制權益在集團資產負債表中以權益項目單獨列示，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開。集團的非控制權益在集團損益表及綜合收益表中以盈虧或總綜合收益或虧損的分配方式，分別列示於非控制權益與基金所有者之間。\n非控制權益在財務報表中屬於權益的一部分，但與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。在集團的損益表及綜合收益表中，非控制權益會以當年度盈餘或虧損以及總綜合收益或虧損在非控制權益與基金所有者之間的分配方式呈現。\n各譯文在整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的專業內容，但在語句流暢度、語法正確性與用詞精準度方面仍有改進空間。例如，部分譯文使用了「非控制性權益」與「非控制權益」混用，導致術語不一致；另外，部分句子結構較為冗長，影響閱讀流暢度。此外，對「financial liability」的翻譯，有譯文使用「財務負債」，也有使用「金融負債」，應統一為「財務負債」以符合會計專業術語。在語法方面，部分句子存在語序不當或成分殘缺的問題，需進行調整以提高語句的自然度與專業性。此外，部分譯文在處理「presented in the Group balance sheet」與「presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account」等語句時，翻譯略顯生硬，可進一步優化語句結構，使其更符合中文財務報告的表達習慣。總體而言，各譯文在專業內容傳達上表現尚可，但在語句流暢度、語法正確性與術語一致性方面仍有提升空間。\n非控制權益指子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未另行達成任何條款，導致集團整體對該等權益負有契約義務，而該義務符合財務負債的定義。非控制權益在集團資產負債表中以權益項目單獨列示，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開。集團的非控制權益在集團損益表及綜合收益表中以盈虧或總綜合收益或虧損的分配方式，分別列示於非控制權益與基金所有者之間。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減值損失（如有）列示（附註2.14）。\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本計列，減去減值損失（如有）（附註2.14）。\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減損損失列示（如有）（註2.14）。\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本減去已確認的減值損失列示（參見附註2.14）。\n基金資產負債表所示，其於子公司之投資按成本減除減損損失（如有）列計（請參閱附註2.14）。\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去任何減值損失列示（附註2.14）。\n上述六種翻譯各有優缺點。第一種翻譯語句通順，但「以成本計列」較為口語化，不夠正式。第二種翻譯使用「減損損失」，與「減值損失」略有差異，可能引起誤解。第三種翻譯較為準確，但「減損損失」仍不夠標準。第四種翻譯使用「已確認的減值損失」，語意較為明確，但「參見」較不常見於財務報告中。第五種翻譯語句較為繁複，且「減除」與「列計」搭配不夠自然。第六種翻譯使用「任何減值損失」，語意較為強調，但與原文語氣略有出入。\n綜合考量語意準確性、語句流暢度與財務報告的正式語氣，最佳翻譯應使用「減值損失」而非「減損損失」，並採用「列示」一詞，以符合財務報告的標準用語。此外，「附註2.14」的標示方式也應與原文一致，使用「附註」而非「註」或「參見」。\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減值損失（如有）列示（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 關聯企業與合資企業\n\n關聯企業係指集團透過參與其財務及營運政策決策之權力，對該企業之管理具有重大影響力，但並未達到控制或共同控制之程度之實體。\n"}
