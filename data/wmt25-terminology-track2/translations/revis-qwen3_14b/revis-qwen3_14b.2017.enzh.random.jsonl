{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

行政長官的聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通貨膨脹仍然處於低水平；美國聯邦儲備系統當年進行的三次加息及縮減資產負債表的措施，並未造成新興市場經濟體的資本外流或美元走強。在牛氣沖天的市場情緒下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恆生指數在2017年錄得近8,000點（或36%）的升幅，並突破30,000點關口，於2018年1月創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境中充滿樂觀，甚至過度樂觀。然而，這種情況持續到今年2月初，當時最新數據顯示美國工資上漲幅度高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市出現顯著調整。道瓊斯指數在2月第二週的兩天內下跌超過1,000點，而恆生指數在同一週下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率則急升至高達2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉顯示，創紀錄的高市場估值並非建立在紥實的根基之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個穩健而強健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資金外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 銀行體系韌性因防患未然措施而提升。\n\n有云「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩釋措施，以保障香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆週期措施，並加強銀行對地產商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在加強銀行體系對來自樓市任何逆轉所引起衝擊的韌性。透過多個輪次的措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比由2009年9月的64%下降至2017年底的49%，而平均償債比率亦由2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被視為「大到不能倒」的不可持續金融機構。這將幫助避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時動用了公帑拯救面臨倒閉的金融機構，並減低這些機構結業對金融體系、經濟及社會大眾的影響。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率遠高於適用的法定要求，位居全球前列。這無疑顯示香港銀行體系具有高度的韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%跌至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均2.2%。銀行業整體股東權益回報率（根據稅前營運利潤計算）在2017年達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，是一個非常健康的水平。\n\n# 穩健的銀行業是長期財務穩定的關鍵。\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和法規來制約金融業追求盈利而未有顧及其主要責任的局限。鑑於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）近年來加強推廣「穩健銀行」實踐，鼓勵銀行發展並追求良好的企業文化與價值觀。特別是為解決銀行員工追求短期利潤而損害其顧客或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行設立與其企業文化及價值觀一致的適當激勵制度。作為此計劃的一部分，我們於2017年3月安排舉辦首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年度會議，以突顯建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並幫助INEDs更有效地發揮其監督與監察的角色。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年是香港金融管理局在推動金融包容方面取得成功的一年。6間實體銀行分行及3間流動分行開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與EPS及一間便利商店連鎖機構合作，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的商店提款，無需進行購物。香港郵政亦於今年在離島及新界地區的七間郵政局推出為長者提供的現金提款服務。在開戶方面，香港金融管理局去年設立專頁及電郵賬戶，並設有專責團隊跟進與開設銀行賬戶相關的公眾查詢或投訴。經多方持份者的努力，開設個人及公司銀行賬戶的客戶體驗已取得顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技是銀行業的遊戲規則改變者\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry,\" is concise and impactful, emphasizing the transformative role of fintech in the banking sector. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\n1. **Translation 1:** \"金融科技成為銀行業的遊戲改變者\" – This translation is accurate and fluent. However, \"遊戲改變者\" is a direct translation of \"game changer\" and may not be the most idiomatic expression in Traditional Chinese. It is understandable but lacks the nuance of the original.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"金融科技為銀行業帶來變革\" – This is a fluent and natural translation. It conveys the idea that fintech is bringing about change in the banking industry. However, it is somewhat generic and does not fully capture the \"game changer\" aspect.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"金融科技顛覆銀行業\" – This translation is strong and impactful, using the term \"顛覆\" (upend) to convey a significant transformation. However, it may be too strong and could imply a complete overthrow rather than a transformative change.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"金融科技為銀行業帶來重大轉變\" – This is a good translation that conveys the idea of a major transformation. It is slightly more formal than the original title but still accurate.\n5. **Translation 5:** This is a repeat of Translation 2 and suffers from the same limitations.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"金融科技是銀行業的遊戲規則改變者\" – This is the most accurate and idiomatic translation. It uses \"遊戲規則改變者\" (game rule changer), which is a more natural and commonly used expression in Chinese to convey the idea of a \"game changer.\" It also maintains the structure and emphasis of the original title.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should capture the essence of \"game changer\" in a way that is both idiomatic and impactful in Traditional Chinese. \"遊戲規則改變者\" is a more natural and commonly used expression in Chinese to convey the idea of a \"game changer.\" It also maintains the structure and emphasis of the original title, making it the most appropriate choice.\nTherefore, the improved translation is:\n# 金融科技是銀行業的遊戲規則改變者\n\n在科技快速發展的新紀元，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這個持續變化的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新發展，並在金融科技的應用上追求創新。隨著智慧銀行新紀元的到來，香港金融管理局於9月推出了七項措施（詳見106頁），推動銀行業採用金融科技，以提升銀行產品與服務的品質，更好地服務顧客。雖然這些措施彼此獨立，但具有互補性，將成為香港支付與銀行服務未來生態的重大改變。顧客不僅能享受更方便、快捷且安全的支付與銀行服務，還將擁有更多選擇，並對財務交易擁有更大控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來商業成功的關鍵，而邁入智慧銀行新紀元將為銀行帶來重大升級與轉型的機會。\n\n# 由「一帶一路」及「粵港澳大灣區」倡議締造的龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化金融產業對香港至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強推動香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。鑑於香港擁有「背靠內地，維持國際視野」的無與倫比的優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區的發展將為金融和銀行業帶來龐大的機遇，並為香港經濟增長帶來新的動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自推出以來，其合作夥伴數目已增至約90個，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心打下紥實根基。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，突顯香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資中所發揮的樞紐地位。\n\n此外，除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業財務中心、私人股權基金及亞洲衍生產品業務樞紐的發展，透過吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在香港管理其資金、資產及各種財務風險。這些措施將進一步鞏固並升級香港的金融及相關專業服務範疇。香港金融管理局亦與負責粵港澳大灣區發展的有關當局保持緊密溝通，以加強合作，從而為該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展作出貢獻。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「善用香港優勢，滿足國家所需」為主軸持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年7月推出債券通北向交易後，內地與全球其他地區透過香港金融平台的市場互聯互通已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為金融中介的獨特地位，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場。2017年，香港維持其作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的領先地位。人民幣實時全額清算系統的日均交易額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計數據，當年全球逾70%的人民幣支付交易均透過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的軟實力\n\n鑑於金融業持續增長，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局注重銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業員持續提升其專業能力。繼在提升能力框架下推出兩項專業資歷，分別為反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資及網絡安全後，我們於去年擴展了其覆蓋範圍，加入零售財富管理及財務管理，以透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業員的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦致力培育銀行業的年青人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理學徒試驗計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃將於未來進一步擴展其覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 謹慎的投資策略在中長期取得合理且平穩的回報\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"謹慎投資策略於中長期取得合理且平穩之報酬\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"謹慎\" for \"prudent,\" \"中長期\" for \"medium to long term,\" and \"平穩\" for \"stable.\" The structure is formal and appropriate for financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"之\" is overly formal and not commonly used in modern financial writing. \"報酬\" is acceptable but \"回報\" is more natural in this context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"勤儉的投資策略，在中長期取得合理且平穩的報酬\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"中長期\" and \"平穩\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"勤儉\" is not an appropriate synonym for \"prudent\" in the context of investment strategy. It implies frugality, which is not the intended meaning.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"穩健的投資策略在中長期取得合理且平穩的回報\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"穩健\" for \"prudent,\" which is a common and natural term in financial contexts. \"回報\" is more natural than \"報酬.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"穩健\" is slightly more conservative than \"prudent,\" but still acceptable. The structure is fluent and natural.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"謹慎的投資策略在中期至長期期間取得合理的平穩回報\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"謹慎\" and \"平穩\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"中期至長期期間\" is unnecessarily wordy. \"中長期\" is more concise and natural.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"謹慎的投資策略，旨在於中長期內取得平穩的回報。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"謹慎\" and \"平穩\" correctly. The structure is clear and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"旨在於\" is slightly awkward. \"旨在\" alone would be more concise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"審慎的投資策略取得合理的長期平穩回報\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"審慎\" for \"prudent,\" which is a formal and appropriate term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"長期平穩回報\" is slightly awkward in structure. \"中長期\" is more accurate than \"長期\" for \"medium to long term.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should use \"謹慎\" for \"prudent,\" \"中長期\" for \"medium to long term,\" and \"回報\" for \"return.\" It should be concise, natural, and appropriate for a financial context. Based on these considerations, the best translation combines elements from the first, third, and fifth translations, resulting in:  \n\"謹慎的投資策略在中長期取得合理且平穩的回報\"\n\n背靠強勁的全球經濟增長，儲備基金去年取得創下新高的投資收入2,640億港元，各類資產均錄得回報，包括股票、債券及外匯。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合取得12.1%的回報率，而後備組合則錄得1.8%的回報率。長期增長組合（LTGP）自2009年成立以來的年化內部回報率達至13.7%。雖然去年投資表現佳績，但日益複雜的投資環境需要香港金融管理局繼續謹慎管理儲備基金。我們將維持機動靈活，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候部署防禦措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一如以往，管理香港市民財富時，將秉承「資本保值為先，長期增長為後」的投資原則，在可控風險水平內進行。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續去年的升勢，但2018年仍潛藏不確定性及風險。這些包括美國加息步伐加快，一旦通脹回升，以及貿易摩擦升溫和地緣政治生態惡化。若這些下行風險觸發，將對全球金融市場產生顯著且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟造成連鎖影響。因此，我們應謹慎管理風險。\n\n未來數月，相信香港美元利率走勢將持續受到關注。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已提升利率6次。隨著香港美元利率與其美元對應利率之間息差擴闊，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機變得更大。近期香港美元持續承受走弱壓力，且7.85弱方兌換承擔（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金管局將扮演「超級兌換商」的角色，在市場上購買香港美元並出售美元，以保證香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此類操作屬正常，亦符合聯匯制度的設計。這不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，香港外匯基金現時持有的資產超過4兆港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1,700億港元，為資金外流情況提供強大緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已建立多個防線，以保障銀行及金融系統的穩定。從正面來看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金管局將嚴陣以待，並竭盡全力維持香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2017\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy grows at a faster pace on the back of synchronised expansion of the global economy. The local stock market rallies and residential property market maintains its upward momentum, while housing affordability stretches further.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains safe and sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar eases against the US dollar as a result of the widening negative interest rate spreads between the two currencies. Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

2017年重點摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在背靠全球經濟同步擴張的推動下，增長步伐加快。本地股市上揚，住宅樓市維持升勢，而住房負擔能力則進一步收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全與穩健，資本及流動性狀況強勁，資產質素健康。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯員的翻譯時，我們發現他們都正確使用了詞彙表中的關鍵詞，如「強」、「香港」、「穩健」、「健康」、「維持」、「安全」，這一點值得肯定。然而，翻譯的流暢度、語法準確性與語感自然度仍有提升空間。\n1. **第一譯文**：語法正確，但「資本和流動性頭寸」中的「頭寸」在中文語境中較少用於此類經濟語境，「狀況」或「地位」更為自然。\n2. **第二譯文**：語句簡潔，用詞自然，但「資本及流動性狀況強勁」語序略顯生硬，可調整語序使其更符合中文習慣。\n3. **第三譯文**：語法正確，但「擁有強大的資本和流動性」語感稍顯直譯，可改為「資本及流動性狀況強勁」更符合中文經濟語境。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句流暢，但「擁有強勁的資本和流動性狀況」語序略顯冗長，可簡化。\n5. **第五譯文**：語法正確，但「資本及流動性地位強勁」中「地位」一詞在經濟語境中較少使用，「狀況」更為合適。\n6. **第六譯文**：整體語句流暢，語法正確，但「具備強勁的資本及流動性地位」中「地位」一詞仍顯不自然。\n**改進方向：**\n- 選擇更符合中文經濟語境的詞彙，如「狀況」而非「頭寸」或「地位」。\n- 調整語序，使句子更符合中文語感，如將「擁有」改為「資本及流動性狀況強勁」。\n- 確保語句簡潔、自然，避免過於直譯或冗長。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n香港銀行業維持安全與穩健，資本及流動性狀況強勁，資產質素健康。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港美元因兩種貨幣之間的負利率息差擴闊而回軟。然而，公眾對聯匯制度仍保持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性充裕。香港基準利率總計上調75個基點，至1.75厘，因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的上升。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將其監管重點放在銀行風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。為鞏固銀行業對房地產市場任何逆轉的韌性，推出第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。\n\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立新的防線。解決辦公室作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）努力讓解決機制在香港銀行業運作的一部分而設立。\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立新的防線。解決辦公室作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）努力讓解決機制在香港銀行業運作的一部分而設立。\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立新的防線。解決辦公室作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）努力讓解決機制在香港銀行業運作的一部分而設立。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n推出七項新措施，以把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲的金融科技中心。經一連串網絡及能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其在離岸人民幣業務中的領先地位。債券通的推出鞏固了香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶的地位。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，香港儲備基金達到2,640億港元的投資收入新高，創下7.4%的投資回報率。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate, but it incorrectly refers to the \"Exchange Fund\" as \"香港交換基金\" (Hong Kong Exchange Fund), which is not the standard term in Chinese. The correct term is \"香港儲備基金\" (Hong Kong Exchange Fund is more accurately translated as \"香港儲備基金\" or \"香港外匯基金\").\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** misidentifies the subject as \"證券及期貨事務監察委員會\" (Securities and Futures Commission), which is unrelated to the original text. This is a clear error in subject identification.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** correctly uses \"儲備基金\" for \"Exchange Fund\" and \"2,640億港元\" for \"HK$264 billion.\" However, it omits the phrase \"record high\" and places it awkwardly in the sentence structure.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses \"交易所基金\" (Exchange Fund), which is a direct translation but not the standard term in Chinese. It also places \"新高紀錄\" awkwardly in the sentence.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is the most accurate so far. It correctly identifies the subject as \"香港儲備基金,\" uses the correct numerical translation, and places the phrase \"創下新高紀錄\" in a natural position. However, it could be more concise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** misidentifies the subject as \"投資基金\" (investment fund), which is not the same as \"Exchange Fund.\" It also places the phrase \"紀錄新高\" awkwardly in the sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\n受惠於有利的投資環境，香港儲備基金達到2,640億港元的投資收入新高，創下7.4%的投資回報率。\nThis translation accurately reflects the original English text, uses the correct terminology, and maintains a natural and fluent structure in Traditional Chinese. It correctly identifies the subject as \"香港儲備基金,\" uses the proper numerical translation, and places the key phrases in a logical and natural order.\n\n投資多元化方面的努力持續進行，特別是透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率為13.7%。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續加強企業管治，透過支持員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律，以及加強資訊科技保安，以應付因落實新舉措及工作日益繁重所引起的挑戰。\n"}

大事紀要 2017\n\n# 1月17日\n\n香港金融管理局基礎設施融資便利辦公室（IFFO）於第十屆亞洲金融論壇舉辦兩項基礎設施投資與融資活動。\n\n# 1月27日\n\n香港金融管理局宣布，香港的逆周期資本緩衝率將自2018年1月1日起上調至1.875%。\n\n# 2月22日\n\n政府宣布在其政府債券計劃下成功發行第三筆蘇克債券。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注語法正確性、語意準確性、語句流暢度以及文化適切性。首先，所有翻譯都正確使用了詞典中指定的對應詞彙：「宣布」對應「announces」、「成功」對應「successful」、「提供」對應「offering」。然而，各版本在語序、語意清晰度與語感上存在差異。\n第一版翻譯「政府宣布在其政府債券計劃下成功發行第三筆蘇克債券。」語序自然，語意清晰，符合中文表達習慣，且正確使用了「發行」一詞，比詞典中的「提供」更貼切「offering」在金融語境中的含義。\n第二版「政府宣布其第三期政府債券計劃下的發行成功。」語序略顯生硬，「發行成功」雖語法正確，但不如「成功發行」自然。\n第三版「政府宣布其第三期蘇克債券根據政府債券計劃成功提供。」語序混亂，「根據」一詞使用不當，且「提供」在金融語境中不如「發行」準確。\n第四版「政府宣布在其政府債券計劃下成功提供了第三筆蘇庫克。」語序正確，但「蘇庫克」是「sukuk」的音譯，與「蘇克債券」相比，缺乏文化適切性與專業性。\n第五版「政府宣布其政府債券計劃下第三期伊斯蘭債券的成功提供。」使用了「伊斯蘭債券」，雖然準確，但與「蘇克債券」相比，較少見於官方文件中，且語序略顯不自然。\n第六版「政府宣布其第三期政府債券計劃下成功的提供。」語序混亂，「成功的提供」語法不正確，應為「成功提供」。\n綜合考量語法、語意與語感，第一版翻譯最為自然、準確，符合中文表達習慣，且使用了「發行」一詞，更符合金融語境中「offering」的含義。因此，我們選擇第一版作為基礎，並進行微調以確保語意與語感最佳。\n**Final

accurate, using the correct term \"運作\" for \"operation\" and correctly translating \"25\" as \"25\". It also uses the proper title \"財政司司長\" for \"Financial Secretary\" and \"貨幣當局\" for \"Monetary Authority\". The structure is clear and natural in Traditional Chinese.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent but slightly less formal in its phrasing (\"而財政司根據 FIRO 指定貨幣當局\") and uses \"跨部門組別\" instead of \"跨行業小組\", which may not be as precise as the original \"cross-sectoral groups\".\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"金融穩健恢復條例\" instead of \"FIRO\" and \"金融管理局\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\", which are not in the dictionary and may not be the official terms. It also uses \"首席解決方案權威\" which is not as precise as \"lead resolution authority\".\n4. **Translation 4** has a minor issue with the phrase \"並由 FIRO 下的財政司指定貨幣當局\", which may imply that the FIRO has a \"財政司\", which is not accurate. The original text says the Financial Secretary designates under the FIRO.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"金融穩定條例\" instead of \"FIRO\" and \"金管局\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\", which are not in the dictionary. It also uses \"決議機構\" instead of \"resolution authority\", which is not the exact term.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, but uses \"解決當局\" instead of \"解決機構\", which is slightly less natural in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\n根據《金融機構重建條例》（FIRO）的解決機制開始運作，財政司司長根據FIRO指定貨幣當局為25個跨行業小組的主導解決機構。\n\n# 7月18日\n\n香港金管局於6月7日繼香港成為亞投行成員後，主辦與亞投行的分享會。  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"hosts\" → \"主辦\", \"member\" → \"成員\", \"HONG\" → \"香港\", \"JUNE\" → \"6月\", \"becoming\" → \"成為\", \"sharing\" → \"分享\", \"Following\" → \"繼\". The structure is natural and the sentence flows well in Traditional Chinese.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"香港金融管理局\" (the full name of HKMA) and \"亞洲基礎設施投資銀行\" (the full name of AIIB), which is more formal and appropriate in official contexts. However, it adds \"一場\" (a) which is not in the original text, though it is not incorrect.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is problematic. It places \"HKMA\" and \"AIIB\" without translating them, which violates the dictionary instructions. Also, the structure is awkward: \"HKMA主辦一個分享會與AIIB，繼香港於6月7日成為AIIB成員後\" is not grammatically correct in Traditional Chinese.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is accurate and fluent. It uses the correct dictionary terms and provides the full names of HKMA and AIIB, which is appropriate. The structure is natural and the sentence flows well.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is accurate but lacks the full name of AIIB, which may be less formal. It also omits the date \"6月7日\" in the phrase \"繼香港於6月7日成為亞洲基礎設施投資銀行的成員\", which is slightly awkward compared to the first translation.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is slightly off in the placement of the date. It says \"將於6月\" (will be in June), which implies a future event, but the original text refers to an event that already happened on 7 June. This is a minor but important inaccuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**\n香港金管局於6月7日繼香港成為亞投行成員後，主辦與亞投行的分享會。\n\n# 7月27日\n\n香港金融管理局與香港應用科學及科技研究院聯合舉辦金融科技職業加速計劃啟動日。\n\n# 7月31日 – 8月4日\n\nIFFO 主辦高階主管培訓課程，與國際金融公司（IFC）及哈佛肯尼迪學院合作，專注於公私合作夥伴關係與專案融資。\n各譯文評析如下：\n1. 第一位譯者譯文語意完整，但「主題為」語氣較為口語，與正式機構合作項目語境稍顯不協調。\n2. 第二位譯者將「hosts」譯為「主辦」正確，但「項目融資」與「專案融資」混用，應統一為「專案融資」。此外，「高級行政人員」語感較生硬。\n3. 第三位譯者用詞較為自然，但「公共-私人合作夥伴關係」中間的連字符使用不當，應為「公私合作夥伴關係」。\n4. 第四位譯者雖正確使用「合作夥伴關係」，但將「專案融資」譯為「專案融資」與「項目融資」混用，語意不一致。\n5. 第五位譯者語意完整，但「主題為」語氣與機構合作項目語境不協調，且未明確標示「hosts」為主辦方。\n6. 第六位譯者資訊完整，但過度補充「世界銀行集團成員機構」，與原文簡潔風格不符。\n最佳譯文應明確標示「主辦」，統一使用「專案融資」，並避免過度補充資訊，使語句自然流暢，符合機構合作項目之正式語境。\n\n# 8月4日\n\n4宗零售支付系統由香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（第584章）指定。\n\n# 8月15日\n\n香港金融管理局主辦開放應用程式介面（API）工作坊。\n\n# 8月25日\n\n香港金融管理局、香港銀行公會及DTC協會聯合宣布，自2017年12月1日起，透過香港商業信貸參考機構擴展商業信貸數據分享的覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 9月5–7日\n\n香港金融管理局與中國銀保監會聯合舉辦「2017香港高級銀行家研討會」。\n\n# 9月11日\n\nIFFO於「一帶一路」高峰論壇主辦小組討論，推動香港在「一帶一路」中把握融資機遇的獨特優勢。\n\n# 9月18日\n\n由香港金融管理局與財政市場協會聯合舉辦的2017財政市場峰會於香港舉行。\n\n# 9月19日\n\n香港金融管理局與國際金融公司（IFC）在倫敦簽署協議，承諾撥款10億美元至新興市場的多邊信貸參與計劃（MCPP），以支持IFC在超過100個國家的項目融資，包括基礎設施、電信、製造業、農業商業及服務業。\n\n香港金融管理局與瑞士聯邦財政部國際金融事務國家秘書處於瑞士伯恩推出首屆香港－瑞士金融溝通。\n\n# 9月19–21日\n\n香港金融管理局與香港數碼港帶領規模最大的金融科技代表團前往倫敦，旨在促進合作，開展業務及投資機遇，並推動香港作為亞洲領先金融科技中心的地位。\n\n# 9月21日\n\n香港金融管理局率領在倫敦舉辦一場題為「香港：通往一帶一路機遇的門戶」的研討會。該研討會是香港貿易發展局在倫敦舉辦的「Think Asia, Think Hong Kong」推廣計劃的一部分。\n\n# 9月29日\n\n香港金融管理局推出多項措施，為香港邁入智慧銀行新紀元作好準備。這些措施包括加快支付系統、提升金融科技監管沙盒2.0、推廣虛擬銀行、銀行易辦事計劃、開放API、加強跨境合作以及提升研究與人才發展。\n\n# 20 10月\n\n2017年銀行（資本）（修訂）規則、2017年銀行（流動性）（修訂）規則及2017年銀行（多邊開發銀行）（修訂）通告已刊憲。\n\n# 10月25日\n\n香港金融管理局舉辦HKMA金融科技日，內容包括關於跨境合作、分布式賬本技術（DLT）、監管溝通及開放API的小組討論，以及有關支付、DLT、大數據、人工智慧及開放API的工作坊。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）在香港簽訂並交換合作協議，以鞏固在金融科技領域的合作。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布加強與金融科技發展署在金融科技方面的合作，包括聯合舉辦金融科技獎項、提供互惠的軟著陸支持以及人才發展計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局發表其第二份關於區塊鏈技術的白皮書，確認區塊鏈技術的潛力，同時承認區塊鏈技術並非所有金融應用的萬能解決方案。\n\n財政部在香港舉行美元主權債券發行的路演。\n\n# 10月27日\n\n香港金融管理局發出通函，要求註冊機構提升其網上交易服務的安全性，以解決與網上交易相關的網絡攻擊風險。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - Strengths: Uses \"提升\" for \"enhance\" correctly, and \"解決\" for \"address\" appropriately.\n   - Weaknesses: \"circular\" is translated as \"circular\" (保留英文), which is not ideal.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier.

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟擴張更加同步的背景下，香港在2017年見到經濟增長加快、勞動市場狀況趨緊及通脹壓力較為溫和。預計2018年的經濟增長將維持紥實。\n在全球經濟擴張更加同步的背景下，香港在2017年見到經濟增長加快、勞動市場狀況趨緊及通脹壓力較為溫和。預計2018年的經濟增長將維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在更同步的全球經濟擴張下，香港經濟在2017年實現更快增長。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長，以及過去10年約3%的長期增長（圖1和表1）。內需穩步回升，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回升。更強勁的內需反映了有利的就業和收入狀況、資產價格上漲以及企業樂觀情緒改善。外圍方面，香港貨物出口因全球貿易流量增加而加快擴張，服務出口則因貿易和貨運流量暢旺以及入境旅遊業改善而恢復。貨物進口在出口帶動的需求下錄得較強增長，服務進口則在本地居民旅遊興趣強勁的背景下穩定上升。從淨出口基礎來看，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長產生了負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率一般因港元與美元之間的負利率差異，主要由利率套利活動推動而回軟。這反映了聯匯制度按照其設計的正常運作。雖然港元銀行間利率仍處於相對低位，但由於與新股發行相關的資金需求及銀行年底流動性需求，該利率在2017年底面臨更大升勢壓力。就信貸增長而言，在經歷兩年個位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款以顯著加快的16.1%速度增長，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場正面情緒。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸審批標準並未出現放鬆跡象，整體貸款質量仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在2017年全年仍然得到良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，核心通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是物價指數中的房屋組成項目升幅放緩，反映2016年私人住宅新簽訂租賃價格增幅放緩的滲透效果。更廣泛而言，在強勁的產出增長下，名義工資及收入較溫和的上升有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦屬溫和，與香港主要進口來源地低通脹情況一致，儘管美元轉弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年勞動市場在高於趨勢的經濟增長下收緊。經過季節調整的失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，這是近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門各自錄得失業率下降，其中零售、金融及專業和商業服務部門的下降幅度更為明顯。隨著總體就業增長加快，以及私人部門職位空缺數字增加，整體勞動需求繼續鞏固。勞動力亦擴展，部分反映年長員工（55歲及以上）參與度提高。在更緊縮的勞動市場條件和較低通脹下，實際工資和收入見到加快增加。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎沒有中斷地上漲。恆生指數上升36%，為自2010年以來的最大年度漲幅（圖4）。這波漲勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並部分受到內地投資者透過滬港通和深港通帶來的重大資金流入的支持。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍然處於高水平。平均每日成交額從前一年的669億香港元擴展至883億香港元，而本地市場籌集的整體股本資金亦上升至5814億香港元，較一年前的4901億香港元為高。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持升勢（圖4）。交易量由一年前的54,701宗擴展至61,591宗，樓價在2017年上升14.8%。房屋負擔能力進一步收緊，樓價與收入比率為16.4，較1997年的次高點更高，而收入與按揭比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。鑒於樓價上升及銀行間按揭業務競爭越趨激烈，香港金融管理局於5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理及保障銀行體系穩定。在這些措施推出後，樓價升勢短暫放緩，但於第四季重新加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，交易活動全年顯著上升，交易價值及成交量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年同期微升。\n\n# 經濟前景分析\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預期將維持紥實。政府預測增長幅度為3至4%，而私人部門分析師預測經濟將以平均3.2%的速率擴大。外圍方面，香港的出口表現將持續受惠於改善的全球增長前景及入境旅遊的逐步復甦。國內方面，私人消費增長預期將維持穩定，主要歸因於有利的勞動市場狀況。至於固定資本形成，建築及建設活動應會在住房供應上升及持續的基礎設施項目的推動下穩步推進。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但阻力可能來自利率的潛在上升。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在全球通脹仍然溫和，本地成本穩定上升的情況下，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年將維持溫和，但通脹率相信會從2017年的低點逐步回升。例如，由於新簽訂私人住宅租金的上升所帶動，通脹中的租金組成項目可能在2018年下半年增強升勢。市場共識預測2018年的整體通脹率將維持在仍然溫和的2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建造業活動的擴大，以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將在未來一段時間內維持勞動市場偏緊。私人機構分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景在若干不確定因素和風險的影響下，包括與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢惡化。特別是，如果這些風險觸發資金流動的逆轉，香港的貨幣條件可能比預期更快收緊，構成對實體經濟和資產價格的下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍然不明朗。在短期內，現時有利的國內經濟狀況、被認為的住房短缺、低按揭利率及其他住房融資來源（包括地產商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支持），將會繼續支持物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會拖累市場情緒。從長遠來看，物業市場將會繼續面臨多項阻力。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續進行，本地按揭利率最終會上升。此外，由於政府努力增加土地和住宅物業的供應，住房需求與供應之間的差距預計會逐步收窄，這將會在長遠緩和物業價格的上升壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年繼續保持安全穩健，儘管全球經濟存在不明朗因素。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況仍然強勁，資產質素維持在健康水平，而盈利能力則因息差上升及信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化繼續，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的1個月及3個月拆息分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。第4季更見明顯上升。然而，以綜合利率衡量的零售銀行港元資金成本，全年大致平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港的整體稅前營運利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）及手續費和佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）以及營運費用增長（+8.4%）所抵銷。零售銀行的整體稅後利潤因2016年錄得的特定非經常性項目而下跌了18.1%。零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率從2016年的1.44%下跌至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴闊至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，由2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費及佣金收入上升了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生產品業務的收入則下跌了29.9%。\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，由2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費及佣金收入上升了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生產品業務的收入則下跌了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，因營運成本（+8.4%）的上升步伐較營運收入（+11.8%）為慢（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值虧損由2016年的8億港元下降至73億港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行的貸款品質在本年有所改善，不良貸款比率由一年前的0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%下降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的不良貸款比率及逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%下降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素仍然良好，違約率在2017年底維持在低水平0.03%（圖10）。重組貸款比例接近0%。與一年前的4宗個案相比，年底時沒有住宅按揭貸款出現負資產情況。\n\n信用卡貸款的違約率在2017年底保持在0.22%的低水平，較一年前的0.24%（圖10）略低。合併違約及重組貸款的比率微降至0.31%，較此期間的0.33%下降。核銷比率亦跌至1.75%，較2016年的1.92%下降。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款在2017年增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%有所上升。信貸需求增加，受到對全球經濟前景樂觀情緒的推動。由於總存款增長速度較總貸款放緩，整體貸款對存款比率在2017年底上升至73%，較一年前的68.4%有所上升。香港元貸款對存款比率亦在同期上升至82.7%，較77.1%有所上升（圖11）。\n\n內地相關貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在內地子公司入帳的貸款）在2017年上升了17.5%，較2016年錄得的7%增長為高。\n內地相關貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在內地子公司入帳的貸款）在2017年上升了17.5%，較2016年錄得的7%增長為高。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管各譯文在整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的意思，但在語法、用詞、語感與文化適應性方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「展現出高度強大的承受衝擊能力」雖略顯重複，但語意明確。然而「以應對多個衝擊」語感稍顯生硬，可調整語序使其更自然。\n2. **第二譯文**：用詞精準，如「高度強大的承受衝擊能力」與「多個衝擊」搭配合理。但「香港元外匯和貨幣市場」中「香港元」與「外匯」語意重複，可簡化為「港元外匯」或「港元市場」。\n3. **第三譯文**：語句流暢，但「抵抗多個衝擊」語意與前文「展現出高度強大的承受衝擊能力」重複，略顯累贅。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，但「香港美元匯率」與「港元」混用，應統一為「港元」。此外，「金融穩定性」與原文「金融穩定」語意略有差異，建議使用「金融穩定」更貼切。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句自然，用詞準確，如「強大支點」與「高度強大的承受衝擊能力」搭配合理。但「港元匯率及貨幣市場」語序略顯不自然，可調整為「港元匯率與貨幣市場」。\n6. **第六譯文**：語句通順，但「匯兌市場」與「貨幣市場」語意重複，可簡化為「外匯與貨幣市場」。此外，「各種衝擊」與「多個衝擊」語意相近，建議統一為「多個衝擊」以保持語意一致。\n**改進建議**：\n- 統一使用「港元」而非「香港美元」或「香港元」。\n- 避免語意重複，如「高度強大的承受衝擊能力」與「抵抗多個衝擊」可簡化為「高度強大的承受衝擊能力，以應對多個衝擊」。\n- 調整語序，使語句更符合中文語感，如「繼續以有序的方式運作」可簡化為「繼續有序運作」。\n**最佳翻譯**：\n儘管對港元匯率的壓力有所減弱，港元外匯及貨幣市場仍繼續有序運作，並擁有充裕的流動性。聯匯制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支撐，並展現出對多個衝擊的高度強大承受衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在對美元的外匯市場匯率上保持穩定的外部價值，匯率波動範圍在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元之內。貨幣體系的結構特點是由貨幣發行局制度所定義，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須有相應的美元儲備變化來完全配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保\n- 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中\n- 整體餘額，即銀行存放在香港金融管理局的結算賬戶餘額總和\n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）對可兌換承諾（CUs）的堅決承諾來維持。當對香港美元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至強方兌換承諾的HK$7.75對一美元時，香港金融管理局準備好向銀行沽出香港美元以換取美元。整體結餘將隨之擴大，壓低香港美元利率，創造貨幣狀況，使香港美元遠離強方限制，回到7.75至7.85的可兌換區間內。相反地，若香港美元的供應大於需求，且市場匯率下跌至弱方兌換承諾的HK$7.85對一美元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行購入香港美元。整體結餘將隨之收縮，推高香港美元利率，使香港美元遠離弱方限制，維持在7.75至7.85的可兌換區間內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定性\n\n香港貨幣兌換率在2017年一般見到壓力（圖1）。主要在港元與美元利率息差擴闊的情況下，受利息套戥活動推動，港元對美元逐步回軟，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年低7.8265。在9月下旬至11月上旬期間，港元兌換率錄得一定強勢，因新股發行相關資金需求而提升港元流動性，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅範圍內穩步交易。年底時，港元再次出現壓力，部分反映港元流動性狀況微升，以及年底商業對美元需求增加。整體而言，港元兌換市場在2017年整個期間運作正常。\n\n由於CUs未被觸發，2017年整體餘額與未償還EFBNs總額約為1,225.3億港元，維持無大變動（圖2）。當年，香港金融管理局為應對銀行對流動性管理需求的上升，發行了總額為80億港元的增發外匯基金債券。這導致整體餘額在2017年底減少至179.8億港元。增發外匯基金債券的行為符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這僅屬於貨幣基礎組成的改變，從整體餘額轉移至未償還EFBNs。貨幣基礎仍然全面由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n# Money market\n## Review and Reasoning\nThe original English text is \"# Money market\", and the task is to translate it into Traditional Chinese. The dictionary is empty, meaning there are no specific terms that require exact translation. The junior translators have provided several translations, most of which are \"貨幣市場\", which is the standard and accurate translation for \"money market\" in Traditional Chinese.\n### Evaluation of Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:** \"貨幣市場\" – This is correct and standard.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"貨幣市場\" – Same as above, correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"# 財務市場\" – This is problematic. \"財務市場\" translates to \"financial market\", which is not the same as \"money market\". Additionally, the use of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and does not appear in the original text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"貨幣市場\" – Correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"# 貨幣市場\" – Again, the use of \"#\" is unnecessary and does not match the original text.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"貨幣市場\" – Correct.\n### Strengths and Weaknesses:\n- The majority of translations are accurate and use the correct term \"貨幣市場\".\n- The third and fifth translations introduce unnecessary symbols (\"#\") and use incorrect terminology (\"財務市場\" instead of \"貨幣市場\").\n- The translations are otherwise fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate.\n### Potential Improvements:\n- Ensure that no unnecessary symbols are included.\n- Confirm that the correct terminology is used.\n- Maintain consistency with the original text.\n### Final Translation:\n貨幣市場\n\n香港美元銀行間利率在2017年首八個月仍然偏軟，其後至年底面對更多上行壓力（圖3）。儘管存在對美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，香港美元銀行間利率在首八個月一般仍然偏軟。因此，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在1月至8月期間擴闊。從9月起，短期香港美元銀行間利率出現顯著回升，主要由新股集資活動及年底資金需求推動。相應地，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在短期範疇內收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行間利率大多數時間低於基準利率。\n\n基準利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計提高75個基點，由1.00%調高至1.75%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍在當年三次上調共75個基點，由0.50至0.75%提高至1.25至1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式進行，該公式規定基準利率設為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標範圍下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息率（HIBORs）五日移動平均數的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤港元與美元息差的走勢，港元遠期點數的折讓在首三個季度逐步擴闊，12個月港元遠期點數於9月中達到約-615點（圖4）。在第4季，港元遠期點數的折讓隨港元與美元利率之間的負息差收窄而微升。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗融資從2016年的53億港元上升至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯匯匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年設立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支柱，並在一系列區域及全球金融危機中展現出高度的承受衝擊能力。政府重申對聯匯制度的十足承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。香港市民對港元作為支付手段及保值工具的強大信心亦持續存在。在二零一七年對香港的第四條項諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯匯制度的支持，並評論指出聯匯制度仍然是香港最佳的匯率安排。配合強健的金融監管、謹慎的財政管理及靈活的市場，聯匯制度已有效幫助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度仍然是香港的最佳安排。」\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注語法正確性、語意準確性、語感自然度以及是否符合中文表達習慣。\n1. **第一個翻譯**：「聯匯制度維持為香港最佳的安排。」  \n   - 優點：正確使用「聯匯」與「維持」，語法基本正確。  \n   - 缺點：「維持為」語感略顯生硬，中文中更常見的搭配是「仍然是」或「維持是」。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：「聯匯制度維持為香港的最佳安排。」  \n   - 優點：與第一個版本相似，語法正確。  \n   - 缺點：「維持為」語感不自然，與中文習慣用法有差距。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：「聯匯制度對香港而言，仍然是最佳安排。」  \n   - 優點：語感自然，「仍然是」符合中文表達習慣，語意清晰。  \n   - 缺點：未使用「維持」一詞，與詞典要求不符。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：「聯匯制度維持香港的最佳安排。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確，結構簡潔。  \n   - 缺點：「維持」後直接接「香港的最佳安排」，語感略顯突兀，缺少「是」字。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：「聯匯匯率制度維持是香港的最佳安排。」  \n   - 優點：使用「維持是」，語法正確。  \n   - 缺點：「聯匯匯率制度」重複用詞，與原文「Linked Exchange Rate System」不完全對應，且語感較為冗長。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：「聯匯匯率制度維持香港的最佳安排。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確。  \n   - 缺點：與第五個版本類似，「聯匯匯率制度」重複，語感不自然。\n**改進方向：**  \n- 需使用「聯匯」而非「聯匯匯率」，以符合詞典要求。  \n- 「維持」應搭配「是」字，如「維持是」或「仍然是」，以符合中文語感。  \n- 「香港」應使用大寫「香港」，符合詞典要求。  \n- 整體語句應自然流暢，避免語法突兀或重複。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度仍然是香港的最佳安排。」  \n此版本符合詞典要求，語感自然，語法正確，語意清晰。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。2017年間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管努力，以提升銀行業的韌性。鑒於美國聯邦儲備系統持續回復至正常貨幣政策，港元利率亦會逐步回復至正常水平。香港金融管理局重申，根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）及貨幣基礎的縮減，都是港元利率正常化的必要過程的一部分。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾要謹慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融波動做好準備。\n\n為加強貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。背靠比率定義為背靠資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年期間在106.7–108.2%的範圍內波動，未有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然特定外匯基金資產已指定用於背靠組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發衝擊時，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的後盾，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）是外匯基金諮詢委員會的下屬委員會，負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的問題。2017年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了多個議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的驅動因素、HIBOR與倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、物業估值變動對內地企業融資的影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行運作報告，均已在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年來，HKIMR 更加強調其活動的政策相關性。這特別反映在其研討會活動及訪問學者計劃中。HKIMR 一直與主要央行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。同時，於2016年推出的主題研究學者計劃，持續支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）認為重要的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究學者，並公布了29篇工作論文。該中心當年亦舉辦了四項國際會議及工作坊：\n- 第八屆年度國際中國經濟會議，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處？」，於1月在香港舉行。該會議為學者、政策制定者及業界專家提供了一個討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題的平台。會議共發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際溢出效應等議題，亦包括人民幣匯率議題及內地貨幣政策架構與傳導機制等。\n- 第15屆HKIMR夏季工作坊於7月舉行。該工作坊旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供發表研究論文的機會，並提升研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際清算銀行（BIS）聯合舉辦的題為「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」的會議於8月舉行。該會議為深入且具洞察力的討論提供了平台，涵蓋的議題包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備理事會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗汲取」的會議於10月舉行。該會議檢討了過去十年內主要央行所採用的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗與教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興市場的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實質經濟與金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and

銀行業穩定性\nThe original English text is \"# Banking Stability\". The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the main difference being the use of \"銀行業\" (banking industry) versus \"銀行\" (bank) and whether the \"#\" symbol is included.\nStrengths of the translations include the accurate use of the term \"穩定性\" (stability) and the general understanding of the term \"banking\" as \"銀行業\" or \"銀行\". However, there are some weaknesses:\n1. The use of \"銀行\" (bank) instead of \"銀行業\" (banking industry) may be too narrow in scope, as \"banking stability\" refers to the stability of the entire industry, not just individual banks.\n2. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary, as it is not part of the original English text and does not have a direct equivalent in Traditional Chinese.\n3. The translations vary in the use of \"銀行業\" and \"銀行\", which can lead to inconsistencies in meaning.\nImprovements could be made by consistently using \"銀行業\" to accurately reflect the industry-wide aspect of \"banking stability\" and by omitting the \"#\" symbol, as it is not part of the original text. The best possible translation would be \"銀行業穩定性\", which accurately conveys the meaning of \"Banking Stability\" in Traditional Chinese.\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局繼續將監管重點放在授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，HKMA推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以鞏固銀行業應對樓市逆轉的韌性。隨著網絡威脅不斷上升，HKMA加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，HKMA推出七項措施，為香港邁向智能銀行新紀元作準備。授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制的有效性，仍然是HKMA監管工作的重點，作為其打擊金融犯罪努力的一部分。在行為監管方面，HKMA進一步採取措施推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業和初創公司在香港開設及維持銀行賬戶所遇到的困難。同時亦加強對授權機構投資及保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步加強對客戶的保護。\n\n在本地落實國際監管及會計標準方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險敞口限制、復原計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號。為應對在不斷變化的銀行環境及不斷演變的風險生態下對能力建設的需求，香港金融管理局協調業界，發展董事權力提升計劃，並為銀行從業員制定提升能力架構。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構解決機制的金融穩定理事會成員地區之一。該條例樹立了金融穩定的新主軸，賦予貨幣管理局必要權力，以有序方式管理金融機構在可能導致不利系統性後果的情況下的失敗問題。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局有一般目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。取得這個目標取決於金融體系具備高度強大的承受衝擊能力，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下可能以混亂方式失敗。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，以維護金融穩定方面，發揮關鍵作用，這最終有助於避免失敗。貨幣管理局肩負在香港對銀行業務進行審慎監督的責任，其中包括吸收存款業務。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構共同稱為授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監督特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架設計用以保證零風險金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，旨在確保在認可機構出現故障的情況下，解決措施得以以有序方式進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港金融機構的解決機制已設立，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n然而，貨幣管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架的設計目的，是要保證一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為一個解決機構，旨在確保在認可機構出現故障的情況下，解決行動可以以有序的方式進行，以維持認可機構為其顧客所提供的關鍵金融服務的持續性。為此，香港已設立針對金融機構的解決制度，其中貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n然而，貨幣當局無法保證，香港的審慎監管框架亦並非設計用以保證零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣當局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構失敗的情況下，能夠以有序的方式進行解決，從而維持認可機構為其顧客提供的關鍵性金融服務的連續性。為此，香港設立了金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n然而，貨幣當局無法保證，香港的審慎監管框架也並非旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣當局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構出現失敗情況時，解決過程可有序進行，以維持認可機構為其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是認可機構等其他金融機構的解決機構。\n然而，金融管理局無法保證，香港的謹慎監管框架亦非為保證零風險的金融體系而設計。相反，金融管理局作為解決方案權威機構，致力於保證在認可機構出現問題的事件中，解決方案可以有序地進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的重要金融服務。為此，香港金融機構的解決方案制度已設立，根據該制度，金融管理局是認可機構等其他金融機構的解決方案權威機構。\n然而，認可機構不能保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，認可機構作為決策機關，致力於保證在認可機構倒閉的事件中，決策程序可以有秩序地進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的延續性。為此，香港為金融機構設立了一項決策機制，認可機構為其中之一，而認可機構是該決策機制下的決策機關。\n然而，貨幣管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架設計用以保證零風險金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，旨在確保在認可機構出現故障的情況下，解決措施得以以有序方式進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港金融機構的解決機制已設立，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括持牌機構（AIs）的CAMEL評級1、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。作為HKMA持續推動持牌機構更強勁風險治理的一部分，HKMA與持牌機構的董事會或董事會級別委員會舉辦了30次會議，討論集中於重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監察其近期公司治理指引的採用情況。此外，亦舉辦了27場三方會議，參與者為HKMA、持牌機構及其外部核數師。\n\n除離岸活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續進行常規的現場檢查，並輔以針對評估風險較高的領域的主題性審查。這種方法容許HKMA優先配置監管資源，重點關注金融機構所面對的潛在及較為顯著的風險。在該年度，HKMA進行了401次現場檢查和主題性審查。信貸風險管理與控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及營運風險管理。HKMA亦增加了海外檢查的數字，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制的現場檢查和主題性審查數字。此外，專門團隊亦對金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險管理\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Supervision of credit risk.\" The term \"supervision\" can be translated as \"監督\" or \"監管,\" while \"credit risk\" is commonly translated as \"信用風險\" or \"信貸風險.\" The term \"management\" is also a possible translation for \"supervision\" in this context, as in \"管理.\"\nLooking at the translations provided:\n1. **信用風險管理** – This translation uses \"管理\" for \"supervision,\" which is acceptable but slightly more general. It may not fully capture the regulatory or oversight connotation of \"supervision.\"\n2. **信用風險監督** – This uses \"監督\" for \"supervision,\" which is accurate and commonly used in regulatory contexts. However, \"信用風險\" is slightly more general than \"credit risk\" in a financial context.\n3. **信貸風險監督** – This uses \"信貸風險\" for \"credit risk,\" which is appropriate in a financial or banking context. \"監督\" is also accurate for \"supervision.\"\n4. **信用風險監管** – \"監管\" is a strong term for \"supervision\" in regulatory or governmental contexts. \"信用風險\" is also appropriate.\n5. **信貸風險監控** – \"監控\" is more about monitoring rather than supervision, which may not be the best fit for the term \"supervision.\"\n6. **信貸風險監管** – This is very similar to translation 4, using \"信貸風險\" and \"監管,\" which is appropriate in a regulatory context.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, fluency, and contextual appropriateness. \"信貸風險監管\" is the most precise and contextually appropriate, as \"信貸風險\" is more specific to financial credit risk, and \"監管\" accurately reflects the regulatory or supervisory aspect. It is commonly used in financial and regulatory documents in Traditional Chinese.\n**Final Translation:**\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n信貸增長與資產品質\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n信貸增長與資產品質\n信貸增長與資產質量\n所有翻譯都大致正確，但有幾個細節需要注意。首先，「Credit growth」可以翻譯為「信貸增長」或「信用增長」，兩者都正確，但「信貸增長」更常見於金融領域。其次，「asset quality」通常翻譯為「資產品質」，但第六位翻譯者使用了「資產質量」，這在語義上略有不同，「質量」更偏向於物理品質，而「品質」則更符合金融語境。此外，第三和第四位翻譯者在標題前加了「#」符號，這在正式文本中不常見，應避免使用。因此，最佳翻譯應為「信貸增長與資產品質」。\n\n總銀行貸款增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%增長有所提高。根據表2所載，貸款增長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。這包括644億港元的貸款，這些貸款是香港註冊銀行在內地的子公司所入帳的。\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。這包括644億港元的貸款，這些貸款是香港註冊銀行在內地的子公司所入帳的。\n\n人工智能的資產品質在2017年仍然健康。零售銀行的不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%微降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率從0.85%下降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率從2016年的0.82%微降至2017年的0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，此比率從一年前的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n在這六份翻譯中，各有其優點與不足。首先，翻譯的整體語意大致正確，能夠傳達原文的核心內容。然而，在語法、用詞、語境適切性與專業性方面仍有改進空間。\n1. **第一份翻譯**：語句通順，但「風險敞口進行了提升監測」語意略顯生硬，「提升監測」不如「提升監察」或「加強監測」自然。此外，「銀行」一詞在原文中應為「AIs」（即「Authorized Institutions」），翻譯時應使用「信貸機構」或「持牌機構」，而非「銀行」。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：用詞較為專業，如「融資公司」、「備抵呆帳制度」等，但「融資公司」與原文「AIs」不完全對應，且「大型企業」與「主要企業」語意略有差異。此外，「加強了對融資公司向大型企業敞口的監察」語序略顯混亂。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「風險敞口進行了提升監測」與第一份翻譯相同，語意仍顯生硬。此外，「貸款審批標準」與「貸款發放標準」語意略有差異，需根據上下文選擇最合適的詞語。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：保留了「AIs」未翻譯，不符合翻譯規則。此外，「保險 premiums 融資」中「premiums」未正確翻譯為「保險費」，而是保留英文，影響專業性。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：將「AIs」誤譯為「人工智能」，完全曲解原意。此外，「風險敞口監控工作得到了提升」語意不夠精準，應使用「加強監測」或「提升監察」。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「信貸機構對主要企業之 exposures 的監察」中「exposures」未正確翻譯為「風險敞口」，而是保留英文，影響專業性。\n**改進方向**：應確保所有「AIs」正確翻譯為「信貸機構」或「持牌機構」，並正確使用「風險敞口」、「貸款審批標準」、「貸款分類及撥備制度」等專業詞語。此外，語序與語意需更自然流暢，避免直譯造成的生硬感。\n---\n在這一年中，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以確保信貸機構繼續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強了對信貸機構對主要企業風險敞口的監察。並進行了針對性的主題檢查，重點關注貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及對地產商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n物業價格在2017年繼續上升。有更多由授權機構（AIs）發放的貸款涉及借款人擁有多項按揭或其收入主要來自香港以外地區。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於5月19日推出另一輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高授權機構（AIs）計算新住宅按揭貸款資本負擔時的風險權重下限，降低適用於已有按揭借款人的物業按揭貸款的貸款與價值比率（LTV）上限，以及降低適用於收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人的物業按揭貸款的債務償還比率（DSR）上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年推出針對物業按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行對房地產市場相關風險的應對能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月首次推出逆週期措施前的64%，下降至2017年12月的49%。平均債務服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%，下降至2017年12月的35%（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）見到一些地產商以高槓桿為其物業發展項目提供資金，並有部分地產商向物業買家提供高貸款對價值比率（LTV）的按揭貸款。為解決這些發展項目所涉及的風險，HKMA於5月12日推出針對物業發展商貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求認可機構（AIs）降低建築融資的融資上限；要求認可機構為其向物業發展商的貸款設立更多資本，特別是針對按揭貸款相對於股權比例較高的貸款；以及進行一輪主題審查，以保證銀行在對物業發展商的貸款中繼續遵循謹慎的貸款標準。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2月與地政總署合作，開展電子警報服務。電子警報服務會在有關按揭財產的進一步按揭登記提交至地政總署時，向有關認可機構發出通知，以便按揭銀行能根據情況採取適當的風險緩衝措施。\n\n# 監督營運及科技風險\n\n網絡安全威脅在一年內持續上升。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性。作為HKMA於2016年推出的「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）的一部分，30間機構完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另一方面，HKMA與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合決定為網上股份交易推出強制性的雙重驗證。亦進行了一輪針對銀行網絡安全控制及運營韌性的現場檢查。HKMA進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員完成了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何管理由科技推動的潛在新市場參與者所帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行服務\n\n9月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布推出一項措施包，協助香港銀行業遷移至智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，HKMA提升金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新功能包括聊天室功能，可供銀行及科技公司雙方使用，並設立連結，位居香港金融管理局（HKMA）、證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）及保險業監理機構（IA）的沙盒之間，以提供進行跨行業金融科技產品測試的單一入口。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出「Banking Made Easy」計劃，旨在識別及減低監管摩擦，以進一步提升顧客使用金融科技及數字銀行服務的經驗。目前已設立專責小組，重點著力於遠程開戶及賬戶維護、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討已經展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現有虛擬銀行牌照發牌指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行。\n現已開始審視現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現已開始審閱有關虛擬銀行授權的現有指引，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n已展開對現行虛擬銀行授權指引的回顧，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行。\n現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討已經展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現有虛擬銀行牌照發牌指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行。\n現已開始審視現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n現已開始審閱有關虛擬銀行授權的現有指引，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n已展開對現行虛擬銀行授權指引的回顧，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行。\n現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討已經展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# 監督庫務活動與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國繼續回復至正常貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能會變得越來越波動。考慮到這一點，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年加強了對流動性風險的監管重點。HKMA 提升了其監管流動性壓力測試，並增發了額外情境，包括一個更具壓力但合理的資金流出情境，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。HKMA 亦加強了對個別持牌機構流動性狀況的監測與分析，並規定選定的持牌機構鞏固其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局加強了對持牌機構（AIs）在債務證券組合方面市場風險管理的現場檢查。並進行了一輪主題審查，以評估持牌機構（AIs）在增加外幣債券投資活動所引起的潛在風險，以及評估相應風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖實務。\n\n# 預防洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML\/TF）\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》2017年於6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年開始運作。此項修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）所頒佈的最新國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度。這些變更，連同AML\/CFT法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清並落實以風險為本的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序，用於開設賬戶及維護誠實顧客，並在這些程序以遙距方式進行時，鼓勵創新。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation Quality and Fluency:**  \n   The translations generally capture the meaning of the original text, but some suffer from awkward phrasing or unnatural sentence structures. For example, the second junior translator uses \"反恐 financing\" which is incorrect and should be \"反恐怖主義融資\" as per the dictionary. Similarly, the third and sixth translators use \"打擊恐怖分子融資\" or \"反恐怖資金融資\" which are not as precise as the dictionary's \"反恐怖主義融資.\"\n2. **Grammar and Vocabulary:**  \n   Most translations are grammatically sound, but some use non-standard terms. For instance, \"運作\" is used in some translations for \"operation,\" which is acceptable, but \"生效\" is more natural in this context. Also, \"風險為本的方法\" is repeated in some translations, which is redundant and less precise than \"以風險為本的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序.\"\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:**  \n   The use of \"刊憲\" is appropriate for \"gazetted,\" and \"法定指引\" is correct for \"statutory guideline.\" However, some translations use \"風險管理方法\" instead of \"風險為本的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序,\" which is not as accurate in context.\n4. **Dictionary Compliance:**  \n   All translations mostly comply with the dictionary, but some use incorrect or non-listed terms. For example, \"financing\" is not translated as \"融資\" in all cases, and \"task\" is translated as \"任務\" in one instance, which is not in the dictionary. The correct term is \"工作組\" for \"task force.\"\n5. **Improvements:**  \n   The best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, maintain natural flow, and ensure clarity. It should use \"反恐怖主義融資\" consistently, \"刊憲\" for \"gazetted,\" \"2018年\" for \"2018,\" and \"風險為本的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序\" for the CDD process. The phrase \"在這些程序以遙距方式進行時，鼓勵創新\" is more natural than \"並鼓勵在遙距進行這些程序時的創新.\"\nBased on these considerations, the final translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in tone, using the dictionary terms where required and ensuring clarity and fluency in Traditional Chinese.\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA.

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力於提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業金融科技的發展與應用，亦受到持份者和公眾的廣泛好評。由於在這方面進行了一系列網絡建設和能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象亦進一步提升。債券通的推出進一步強化了香港作為通往中國內地機遇主要門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力亦開始見到成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑒於科技迅速發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於9月宣布推出七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元作準備。這些措施包括：  \n- 開展快速支付系統（FPS），以爭取實現數字零售支付的十足連繫；  \n- 推出開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；  \n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；  \n- 推動跨境金融科技合作；  \n- 升級現有金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；  \n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；以及  \n- 推動「Banking Made Easy」新措施，減低顧客在數字化體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局的銀行部門一同發揮樞紐地位，推動這些倡議的落實，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的夥伴數字從成立時約40個增長至截至2018年1月31日的87個。在當年，IFFO舉辦並參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進關鍵持份者之間的經驗分享和合作聯繫。特別是，IFFO在其首屆債務融資和投資者圓桌會議中主導了基礎設施股權投資參考條款表的制定，旨在加強基礎設施項目的銀行可貸性及投資可行性。\n\n債券通於7月推出，標誌香港與內地資本市場互聯互通邁向另一重要里程碑，並進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。當年，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由人民幣270億元上升至人民幣5,000億元。香港維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動暢旺，體現在人民幣即時全額結算（RTGS）系統交易量創新高，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據最大份額。\n\n繼2016年推出企業財資中心（CTCs）稅務制度後，香港金融管理局加強了其外展努力，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40%的企業向香港金融管理局反映，他們正積極計劃在香港設立，或已設立財資中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極參與國際間關於全球及區域金融穩定重要議題的討論。香港金融管理局局長於4月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導有關關鍵金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及快捷運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了紥實的根基。2017年，四個銀行間RTGS系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）的系統可用率達到100%，較目標99.95%更高。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已與兩家內地中央證券存管機構（CSD）設立賬戶，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表有關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付行業的一般安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定4宗零售支付系統（RPSs），使其運作納入香港金融管理局的監督範圍。香港金融管理局亦進行了對16間儲值支付工具（SVF）許可證持有人的監督，這些持有人積極推出新產品及服務，旨在為顧客帶來更多選擇和更理想用戶經驗。另一方面，電子支票及電子帳單呈交及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，包括香港與廣東省全部地區之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n在科技快速發展的情況下，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於9月宣布了七項舉動，旨在幫助香港預備邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。這些舉動旨在幫助銀行業提升至較高水平，並把握由銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行會為零售與企業顧客帶來十足的互相連繫，並允許金融服務與交易以高度的流動性、速度、便利性與安全性執行。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界及金融科技社群密切合作，在落實七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 加快支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，會讓公眾能夠透過使用手機號碼或電郵地址，輕鬆地進行全天候實時資金轉賬。該系統可支援港幣及人民幣支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與快速支付系統，實現所有支付參與者之間的十足連繫。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，該小組由主要信用卡方案營運商、銀行、持牌SVF營運商及商戶收單機構組成，以建立香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。通用二維碼標準會促進商戶使用單一的二維碼來接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為顧客和商戶提供更大的便利。工作小組已最終確定有關技術規範，並會制定落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API讓第三方得以存取銀行的數據，以促進銀行及其他行業所提供的服務更理想且更易融入。用戶因此可於一系統內方便地享用安全環境下的整合服務。為促進銀行業界對開放API的發展與採用，香港金融管理局已擬備一份開放API框架草案，內容包括一組開放API職能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行兩月的行業諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n一項主要的研究專案是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書之後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月公布。第二份白皮書進一步探討三項概念驗證（Proof-of-Concept）工作，即貿易融資、數位身分管理及房貸申請。它亦就銀行與支付產業部署DLT時所涉及的治理、法律合規及一般控制原則等落實問題提供意見。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁Norman Chan先生於香港金融管理局金融科技日宣布發佈有關區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n憑藉香港金融管理局（HKMA）領導的貿易融資概念驗證工作的成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，建成一個名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，用以數字化並共享貿易文件，自動化流程，從而提升整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險和詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出金融科技職業加速計劃。學生的反應正面，共收到421名申請人提交的逾3,000份申請。最終，74名學生接受了來自香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，從7月起參與與金融科技相關的專案，實習期為六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區內合作的第一步，我們正與深圳合作推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，（i）為金融科技公司提供相互的軟著陸支持；（ii）於10月共同舉辦深圳－香港金融科技獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（iii）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融公司進行暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁Norman Chan先生（中），在香港金融管理局金融科技日上，與OFDS總監He Xiaojun先生（左）及數碼港主席李George Lam博士簽署並交換有關軟落地安排的備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎的電子傳單。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"E-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\" The goal is to translate this into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese, ensuring that the term \"Hong Kong\" is translated as \"香港\" as per the dictionary.\n**Analysis of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"深圳-香港金融科技獎的電子傳單。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"香港\" and includes the possessive particle \"的\" for clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hyphen between \"深圳\" and \"香港\" is acceptable, but the use of \"的\" is slightly redundant in this context.  \n2. **Second junior translator:** \"深圳-香港金融科技獎項電子傳單\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"香港\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted the possessive particle \"的,\" which may slightly reduce clarity. Also, \"獎項\" is slightly more formal than \"獎,\" which may not be necessary here.  \n3. **Third junior translator:** \"深圳-香港金融科技獎電子傳單。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"香港\" and is concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hyphen is used, but the sentence lacks a possessive particle, which may make it slightly less clear.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"深圳-香港金融科技獎的電子傳單。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"香港\" and includes the possessive particle \"的,\" making the sentence clear and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong translation.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"深圳香港金融科技獎的電子傳單\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"香港\" and includes the possessive particle \"的.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted the hyphen between \"深圳\" and \"香港,\" which may slightly affect clarity, though it is still understandable.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"深圳香港金融科技獎電子宣傳單\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"香港.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Replaced \"傳單\" with \"宣傳單,\" which is less common in this context. \"傳單\" is more standard for \"leaflet.\" Also, omitted the possessive particle \"的,\" which may reduce clarity.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and grammatically correct. It should include the possessive particle \"的\" to clearly indicate that the leaflet is for the award. It should also use \"傳單\" rather than \"宣傳單\" for consistency with the term \"leaflet.\" The hyphen between \"深圳\" and \"香港\" is acceptable but not strictly necessary, though it can help clarify that the award is jointly between the two cities.\nBased on this reasoning, the best translation is:  \n**深圳-香港金融科技獎的電子傳單。**\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，涵蓋創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流。\n\n在11月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進一步與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）簽署備忘錄，聯合建立全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），該網絡會將新加坡國家貿易平台連接到香港貿易通平台（HKTFP），以形成跨境DLT基礎設施，以便數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷且具成本效益。它將是一個開放平台，允許其他感興趣的地區在未來參與。GTCN預計將於2019年首季推出。\n在評估各份翻譯時，可觀察到以下幾個重點：\n1. **用詞準確性**：所有翻譯都正確使用了詞典中指定的詞彙，如「connectivity」翻譯為「連繫」、「jurisdictions」為「地區」、「jointly」為「聯合」、「future」為「未來」、「launched」為「推出」、「understanding」為「備忘錄」、「order」為「以便」、「would」為「會」、「open」為「開放」、「quarter」為「四分之一」、「first」為「首」、「NOVEMBER」為「11月」、「efficient」為「快捷」。\n2. **語法與流暢度**：翻譯整體語法正確，但部分句子結構略顯生硬，例如「允許其他有興趣的地區未來參與」可調整為「允許其他感興趣的地區在未來參與」，使語序更自然。\n3. **文化與語境適應**：所有翻譯都符合中文語境，但部分用詞如「諒解備忘錄」與「備忘錄」在語境中略有差異，「諒解備忘錄」通常用於雙方達成協議的語境，而「備忘錄」更常見於正式合作文件。\n4. **專業術語**：如「DLT」（Distributed Ledger Technology）在中文中通常翻譯為「區塊鏈技術」或「分布式賬本技術」，但原文中使用「DLT」未翻譯，因此保留英文縮寫更為合適。\n5. **語句連貫性**：部分翻譯在語句連接上略顯斷裂，例如「以便數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷及具成本效益」可調整為「以便數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷且具成本效益」，使語句更流暢。\n基於以上觀察，最佳翻譯應在語法正確、用詞準確、語句流暢、文化適應性強的基礎上，選擇最符合原文語境與語意的表達方式。最終翻譯在保留詞典指定詞彙的同時，調整語序與語句結構，使整體表達更自然、專業且符合中文語境。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月推出的FSS已升級至FSS 2.0，以促進與銀行及科技公司的溝通，推動新想法和新措施。具體而言，FSS 2.0具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可以透過向聊天室尋求意見，而無需透過銀行即可進入FSS。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）和保險業監理機構的沙盒已聯匯，使跨行業金融科技產品的試驗有單一進入點。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已考驗28款新科技產品。其中14宗試點試驗已完成，有關產品隨後已推出至市場。\n\n# 銀行服務取得輕鬆倡議\n\n「Banking Made Easy」計劃已推出，以減低阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦。專責小組已設立，現時重點關注以下地區：\n- 遠程開戶及賬戶維護\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行未有實體分行，預期將提供增發動力，推動金融科技在香港的應用，並帶來一種新的基本客戶經驗，體驗流動及數碼銀行服務。它們亦有助推動金融包容，因為它們通常針對零售範疇，無論是個人或中小企業（SMEs）。香港金融管理局已開始審閱現有的《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的推出。\n\n# 智慧銀行的新紀元\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）去年提出的七項推動香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元的倡議，是一個涉及HKMA內多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆轉的趨勢，HKMA銀行監管主管景宏先生指出，作為監管機構，HKMA必須把握這一新趨勢，緊跟最新科技發展，並適當調整其監管思維和方法，以便將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新水平。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

備付金管理\n\n全球經濟及金融市場在2017年的表現理想，超出預期。全球股市因主要發達及新興市場經濟同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行會逐步收緊貨幣政策而造好。雖然美國聯邦儲備理事會如預期般提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩，美元對其他主要貨幣回落（不加強反而弱化）。在這樣有利的環境下，外匯基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下歷史新高，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n證券交易所基金的主要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所訂立，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的交換價值。該基金亦可動用以保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助香港維持國際金融中心的地位。證券交易所基金受財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）後，投資於證券或其他他認為適當的資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n金融管理局（EFAC）為外匯基金設立了以下投資目標：  \n(a) 保障資本；  \n(b) 保證在任何時候，全部貨幣基礎均全面由高度流通性的美元計價資產支持；  \n(c) 保證有足夠的流動性，可用於維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及  \n(d) 在(a)至(c)的條件下，爭取投資回報，以幫助保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注幾個關鍵點：詞彙準確性、語法正確性、語句流暢度以及文化適應性。根據提供的詞彙表，「purposes」應翻譯為「目的」，「take」應翻譯為「選持」，「full」應翻譯為「十足」。\n1. **第一個翻譯**：語句通順，詞彙使用正確，符合語法規則，且正確使用了「法定目的」、「投資組合結構」、「目標資產配置」等專業詞彙，是目前最接近原意的翻譯。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：將「Exchange Fund」翻譯為「發行機構」，與原意不符，應為「交易所基金」或「儲備基金」。此外，「目標資產組合」與「目標資產配置」語意相近，但「配置」更符合金融語境。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：錯誤地使用了「選持十足」，語法不通，且「交易所基金」與「法定目的」搭配不當，語意混亂。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：同樣錯誤使用「選持」，且「目標資產配置」與「目標資產組合」語意相近，但「配置」更為精準。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：將「Exchange Fund」誤譯為「聯邦基金」，與原意不符，且語句結構混亂，語意不清。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：正確使用了「選持十足」，但語序不自然，且「組合結構」與「組合」語意重複，略顯不專業。\n**改進建議：**  \n在翻譯時，應確保專業詞彙的準確性，如「Exchange Fund」應翻譯為「交易所基金」或「儲備基金」，視上下文而定。此外，「take full account of」應翻譯為「充分考慮」，而非「選持十足」，後者語意不清，不符合中文語法。最後，「target asset mix」應翻譯為「目標資產配置」，以符合金融領域的常用表達。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n這些目標已充分考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n大致而言，發行基金擁有兩大主要組合：後備組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。後備組合（BP）持有流通性極高的美元計價資產，以提供十足的後備，符合貨幣局制度下對貨幣基礎的規定。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國家的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。\n大致而言，發行基金擁有兩大主要組合：後備組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。後備組合（BP）持有流通性極高的美元計價資產，以提供十足的後備，符合貨幣局制度下對貨幣基礎的規定。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國家的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已以謹慎且循序漸進的方式，將匯兌基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）管理，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）管理。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限設為匯兌基金累積結餘的三分之一，進一步的容量則來自於將未來基金的部分資產配置至長期資產。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年設立，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為交易所基金帳戶以戰略目的購入，因該組合具有獨特的性質，故未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 存款於外匯基金\n\n香港發鈔銀行不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP1的表現掛鉤，但未來基金則視乎投資組合的配置，其利率與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為65：35。未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分預計將逐步增加至約50%，於2018年實現。\n\n# 投資流程\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是基於兩種資產配置類別的決定而進行的：戰略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑑於證券交易所基金的投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略性配置的指導下，資產會戰術性地進行配置，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準或戰略性配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然基準和追蹤誤差限制是由財政司長與證券及投資產品監管局（EFAC）磋商後定出，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）在授權下設立。在戰術性偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可選持頭寸，以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約73%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部的BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除內部管理資產外，亦僱用外部基金經理管理約27%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的是運用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以取得可持續的回報，從多樣化且互補的投資方式中受惠，並與儲備基金分享市場心得及技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本，以及扣繳稅及其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素定出，可能每年不同。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"使用\" for \"use\", \"相關\" for \"relating\", \"包括\" for \"includes\", \"定出\" for \"determined\", and \"不同\" for \"fluctuate\". However, \"可能每年不同\" is slightly awkward and could be more natural as \"可能每年不同\" or \"可能每年有所波動\".\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** has some grammatical issues, such as \"且可能不同於年年\", which is not natural in Chinese. Also, \"管理支出\" is not an exact match for \"expenditure relating to the use of external managers\".\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** incorrectly uses \"5月\" for \"May\" instead of \"年\" for \"year\", which is a clear violation of the dictionary instructions. Also, \"並於5月不同年份間波動\" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is mostly fluent and accurate. It uses \"使用\" for \"use\", \"包括\" for \"includes\", \"定出\" for \"determined\", and \"不同\" for \"fluctuate\". However, \"扣留稅\" is not the best term for \"withholding taxes\", and \"托管費用\" is slightly less common than \"保管費\".\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is fluent and accurate. It uses the correct dictionary terms and conveys the meaning clearly. However, \"與外部經理人使用相關的支出\" is slightly awkward compared to \"與使用外部經理人相關的支出\".\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is very accurate and natural. It uses the correct dictionary terms and conveys the meaning clearly. However, \"決定\" is not the exact match for \"determined\" in the dictionary, which lists \"定出\".\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should use the exact dictionary terms where specified, maintain fluency and naturalness in Chinese, and accurately reflect the meaning of the original English text. Based on the above review, the improved translation combines the strengths of the sixth and first junior translators, using \"定出\" for \"determined\" as per the dictionary, and \"不同\" for \"fluctuate\", while ensuring natural phrasing and correct terminology.\n\n#

\n\n金融市場在2008年全球金融危機後的高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外圍方面管理的投資組合，已設立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監察對指引和法規的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持香港金融管理局投資多元化步伐的上升。風險控制工具被採用，以評估在正常及不利市場狀況下的市場風險。亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，讓香港金融管理局能充分發揮內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 負責任的投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任的投資。例如，香港金融管理局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發行的《負責任擁有權原則》，這些原則屬自願性質，並幫助投資者釐定如何最好地應對其在香港上市公司的投資所涉及的擁有權責任。在管理外匯基金方面，香港金融管理局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合所委任的外部基金管理人採用《負責任擁有權原則》來管理投資。此外，前線部門及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以制定及監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入投資流程。\n\n#

2017年的金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現理想，高於預期。在主要發達及新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將緩慢及逐步收緊貨幣政策的背景下，全球股市表現亦佳。特別是香港股市上升了36%，表現優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場中，由於美國聯邦儲備委員會如預期般三次提升利率，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，短期美國國債收益率飆升。然而，美國10年期國債收益率全年維持約2.4%的平穩水平。其他主要國家的10年期政府債券收益率亦在年底變化不大，惟德國公債除外，因其受益於歐元區紥實的經濟增長，以及市場對歐洲央行政策收緊的預期而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場中，儘管美國聯邦準備理事會進行了加息並開始縮減其資產負債表，美元對其他主要貨幣仍有所回落。美元的下跌是因為歐洲和日本經濟增長的回升，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策分歧逐漸收窄。2017年，歐元和日圓對美元分別升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣以及債券和股票市場的表現如表1所載。\n\n表 1 2017 年市場回報\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a simple title: \"Table 1 2017 market returns.\" The dictionary specifies that \"returns\" should be translated as \"回報\" and \"Table\" as \"表.\" All junior translators have correctly used these terms from the dictionary.\nLooking at the translations:\n1. **Translation 1:** \"表 1 2017 年市場回報\" – This is correct and natural. The space between \"表\" and \"1\" is acceptable in titles.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"表1 2017年市場回報\" – This is also correct, but the lack of space between \"表\" and \"1\" may be slightly less common in formal titles, though not incorrect.\n3. **Translation 3:** Same as Translation 1.\n4. **Translation 4:** Same as Translation 1.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"表 2017 年市場回報\" – This omits the \"1\" in \"Table 1,\" which is a critical piece of information. This is a clear error.\n6. **Translation 6:** Same as Translation 2.\nThe best translations are 1, 3, and 4, which include both the table number and the correct term \"回報.\" Translation 2 is also acceptable but slightly less formal due to the lack of space. Translation 5 is incorrect due to the missing number.\n**Improved Translation:**\n表 1 2017 年市場回報\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n香港發行局於2017年錄得2,640億港元的投資收入。這包括海外股票的回報為804億港元、香港股票的回報為583億港元、債券的回報為344億港元、非港元資產的正面估值上調為535億港元，以及發行局投資控股子公司所持其他投資的回報為374億港元。另一方面，戰略投資組合錄得估值回報為45億港元。\n\n香港外匯基金去年的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下新高，高出2007年（1,422億港元）的次高紀錄1,218億港元。\n\n證券交易所基金的總資產於年底達40,153億港元。長期資產管理計劃（LTGP）下的投資市場價值總值為2,356億港元，其中私人股權為1,572億港元，不動產為784億港元。未償還的投資承諾總值為1,624億港元。\n\n交易所基金（不包括戰略組合）於2017年的投資回報率為7.4%。具體而言，IP取得12.1%的回報率，而BP錄得1.8%的回報率。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得13.7%的年化內部回報率。\n\n香港外匯基金自1994年至2017年的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示了2017年的投資回報，以及基金在多個不同年期內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年以來則為4.9%。表3顯示了截至2017年12月31日，基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁余偉文先生（中）在2017年外匯基金結果記者會上發言。\n\n圖1  Exchange Fund的投資回報 (1994至2017年)  \n此譯文正確使用了「圖」與「1994至2017年」的對應譯法，但「Exchange Fund」直譯為「Exchange Fund」未進行本地化處理，應根據語境選擇更合適的中文名稱。\n圖1 交換基金的投資回報 (1994至2017年)  \n「交換基金」雖為直譯，但語意清晰，符合金融術語的常見翻譯方式，且年份正確。\n圖1 交易所基金投資回報（1994至2017年）  \n「交易所基金」可能引起誤解，因「交易所基金」通常指ETF（Exchange Traded Fund），與原文「Exchange Fund」語境不符。\n圖一 聯匯基金投資回報（1994至2017年）  \n「聯匯基金」為香港特有術語，指香港的聯繫匯率制度下的儲備基金，若原文確指此基金，則此譯文正確；但若原文僅為一般基金，則不適切。\n圖1 1994至2017年儲備基金的投資回報  \n此譯文語序自然，但「儲備基金」可能與原文「Exchange Fund」不完全對應，需視基金性質而定。\n圖 1 結匯基金投資回報率 (1994至2017年)  \n「結匯基金」與「投資回報率」的用詞較為專業，但「回報率」與原文「return」語意略有差異，且「圖 1」中間有空格，格式不一致。\n綜合評估，最佳翻譯應使用「聯匯基金」或「儲備基金」，視基金性質而定，並確保語序自然、術語準確。若原文確指香港聯繫匯率制度下的基金，則「聯匯基金」為最佳選擇；若為一般基金，則「儲備基金」更為通用。\n圖1 聯匯基金投資回報（1994至2017年）\n\n表 2 交易所基金的投資回報以港元計\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original English text is \"Table 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms.\" The goal is to translate this title accurately and fluently into Traditional Chinese, while adhering to the dictionary provided.\nFirst, the term \"Table\" is correctly translated as \"表\" in all translations, which is appropriate.\nNext, \"Exchange Fund\" is a key term. In the dictionary, there is no direct translation for \"Exchange Fund,\" but the term \"交易所基金\" appears in the first junior translator's version. However, in the context of Hong Kong, the correct term is \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund), which is the official name of the fund managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The second and sixth junior translators used \"外匯基金\" and \"交換基金\" respectively. \"交換基金\" is not a standard term in this context, so \"外匯基金\" is the correct choice.\nThe term \"in Hong Kong dollar terms\" is translated in various ways. The dictionary provides \"以...計\" as the translation for this phrase. The first junior translator used \"以港元計,\" which is correct and concise. The second used \"以港幣計,\" which is also acceptable, though \"港元\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. The third used \"以港幣計算的,\" which is slightly wordy. The fourth used \"以港元計的,\" which is correct. The fifth used \"以港幣計,\" which is acceptable but less common than \"港元.\" The sixth used \"以港幣計的,\" which is also acceptable but again, \"港元\" is more standard.\nThe term \"investment return\" is translated as \"投資回報\" in the first, second, and sixth translations, which is accurate. The third and fourth translations used \"投資回報\" as well, while the fifth used \"投資回報,\" which is also correct.\nThe term \"of the Exchange Fund\" is translated as \"交易所基金的\" in the first translation, \"外匯基金的\" in the second, and \"交換基金的\" in the sixth. As noted earlier, \"外匯基金\" is the correct term.\nThe fifth translation incorrectly refers to \"香港金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not accurate in this context.\nIn summary, the best translation should use \"外匯基金\" for \"Exchange Fund,\" \"港元\" for \"Hong Kong dollar,\" and \"以...計\" for \"in...terms.\" The first junior translator's version is the closest, but it uses \"交易所基金\" instead of \"外匯基金.\" The second junior translator's version is the most accurate, using \"外匯基金\" and \"以港幣計,\" though \"港元\" is slightly more standard in financial contexts.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be: \"表 2 外匯基金的投資回報以港元計.\" This version is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology.\n\n表3 2017年12月31日儲備基金資產的幣種組合（包括遠期交易）\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations.

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。在這一年中，香港金融管理局繼續加強企業管治，透過支持員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律及加強資訊科技保安，以應付因落實新措施及工作繁重程度增加而產生的各種挑戰。\n\n# 僱用社區 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒保持密切合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及工作的了解。2017年，共舉辦86場開放的公眾活動，包括九場記者會、16場站立式訪問及61項其他公眾職能。此外，安排了42次傳媒訪問，並發行了共360份雙語新聞稿。該局亦每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提升各界對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的認識，已為媒體舉辦導覽活動，讓媒體參觀全新翻新的HKMA資訊中心。此外，亦就廣泛話題，包括債券通機制、物業按揭貸款審慎措施、解決機制及外匯基金投資，為本地及海外媒體舉辦深入的媒體簡報及教育工作坊。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上已能準確傳達原文意思，並正確使用了詞彙表中指定的翻譯。然而，仍存在一些可改善之處：\n1. **機構名稱的準確性**：第六位譯者錯誤地將「HKMA」翻譯為「香港按揭證券有限公司」，正確的機構名稱應為「香港金融管理局」，此處需修正。\n2. **語句流暢度與語氣**：第一、二、五位譯者在語句結構上較為自然，符合中文表達習慣；第三、四、六位譯者則在語氣上稍顯生硬，例如「特舉辦了媒體參觀翻新後的...」、「曾為媒體舉辦導賞團」等，語氣略顯不夠正式。\n3. **用詞選擇**：「解決機制」與「決議機制」在語意上略有差異，應根據原文語境選擇最貼切的詞語。原文中「Resolution Regime」應翻譯為「解決機制」，而非「決議機制」或「解決方案機制」。\n4. **語序與邏輯**：第五位譯者在「內容包括債券通計劃、物業按揭貸款的審慎監管措施、解決機制及發行基金投資等廣泛主題」中，將「廣泛主題」置於句尾，語序略顯不自然，建議調整語序以提升流暢度。\n5. **詞彙表使用**：所有譯文均正確使用了詞彙表中指定的翻譯，如「提升」、「舉辦」、「職能」、「廣泛」、「進行」、「包括」、「工作坊」等，符合翻譯要求。\n**改進建議：**  \n在保持語意準確的前提下，優化語句結構與語氣，使整體翻譯更自然、流暢，並確保機構名稱與專業術語的正確性。此外，應避免過度直譯，以符合中文表達習慣。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘先生於香港金融管理局資訊中心向傳媒推出一幅名為「小改變，大頌歌」的馬賽克藝術作品。該藝術作品以維多利亞港及香港天際線為主題，並使用總共135,811枚不同面額的香港硬幣締造而成。\n\n香港金融管理局首席執行官陳諾文先生就香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室的重點措施，與本地報章進行媒體訪問。\n\n# 公眾諮詢、公眾查詢、公眾問詢三者皆可作為「public enquiries」的翻譯，但各有側重。其中「諮詢」較強調專業意見的徵詢，「查詢」則偏向一般性的資訊請求，而「問詢」則帶有更正式的問答意味。根據原文「public enquiries」的語境，若無特別強調專業性或正式性，「公眾查詢」較為通用且自然。此外，標點符號的使用上，「#」在中文中通常用於標籤或主題標示，若原文無特別語境需求，建議不加使用。因此，最佳翻譯為「公眾查詢」。\n公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供了一個有效途徑，以更理想地了解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的關鍵職能和運作。2017年共處理了8,752宗查詢，約有一半與銀行政策及法規、貨幣及經濟問題、消費者銀行服務以及紙幣和硬幣相關。明顯的例子包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函、貨幣及經濟統計數據、物業按揭貸款的審慎措施，以及防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資。\n\n圖1顯示自2014年以來收到的公眾查詢數字，圖2則提供2017年收到的查詢以性質計的分類。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses the dictionary terms (e.g., \"顯示\", \"自\", \"提供\", \"以...計\") and maintains a clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"以...計\" is used correctly, but \"為準\" is not in the dictionary and may be redundant. \"公眾查詢\" is appropriate, but \"詳細分析\" is slightly vague compared to the original \"breakdown.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"以...計\" correctly and maintains clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"以性質計的分類\" is slightly awkward. \"自2014年以來\" is more natural than \"自2014年起.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"分解\" for \"breakdown,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"公共查詢\" is less common than \"公眾查詢.\" \"以2017年收到的查詢性質計的分解\" is awkward and less fluent.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖一\" and \"圖二\" consistently.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"詳細說明\" is not as precise as \"breakdown.\" \"公共查詢\" is less natural than \"公眾查詢.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"以...計\" correctly and \"分類說明\" is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"以2017年收到查詢的性質為基礎進行分類說明\" is slightly wordy and less direct than the original.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the dictionary terms accurately.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The sentence structure is fragmented and awkward. \"收到 的 數字\" is not natural in Chinese. \"詢問性質 以...計 的 分解\" is unclear and unidiomatic.\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**  \nThe best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, maintain fluency, and reflect the original meaning clearly. \"圖1顯示自2014年以來收到的公眾查詢數字，圖2則提供2017年收到的查詢以性質計的分類\" combines the clarity of the first and second translations, using \"以...計\" correctly and maintaining a natural flow. It avoids redundancy and awkward phrasing while staying true to the original structure and meaning.\n\n圖1 公眾查詢總數\n審查與分析：\n1. 第一位翻譯者將「Total number of public enquiries」翻譯為「總數 公眾查詢」，語序不自然，不符合中文表達習慣，應調整語序。\n2. 第二位與第三位翻譯者將其翻譯為「圖 1 公眾查詢總數」，語序正確，語意清晰，符合中文表達習慣，是目前較佳的翻譯。\n3. 第四位翻譯者將「number」翻譯為「數字」，但語序為「總數字的公眾查詢」，語意不清，「總數字」與「公眾查詢」之間關係不明确，容易引起誤解。\n4. 第五位與第六位翻譯者將「number」翻譯為「數字」，語序為「圖1 公眾查詢總數字」，語意較為清晰，但「總數字」在中文中較少使用，通常會說「總數」或「總數量」。\n總結：目前最佳的翻譯是第二位與第三位翻譯者所提出的「圖 1 公眾查詢總數」，語序正確，語意清晰，符合中文表達習慣。因此，最佳翻譯為「圖1 公眾查詢總數」。\n\n圖2 2017年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，2017年香港金融管理局公布了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告及四期季度通訊，並定期更新每月統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局發行了共23篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的多個時事議題。\n\n# 香港按揭證券有限公司網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過60,000頁的英文及繁體與簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條所維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs的證券從業人員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》所維持的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照持有人登記冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目短捷連結，以引起公眾對香港金融管理局新舉措的關注，例如開戶程序、儲值支付工具的監管制度、基礎建設融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室，以及重要且時效性的資訊，例如提醒公眾需嚴陣以待，以防假冒電話詐騙，以及「硬幣收集計劃」下硬幣推車的設置位置。\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金管局資訊中心位於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向社區介紹金管局工作及推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於每週六天對公眾開放。展覽區介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品供公眾研究。\n\n資訊中心政策專區的新面貌，於2017年2月24日完成翻新工程後重新對公眾開放，該專區推出香港金融管理局的工作及相關金融概念。重新設計的政策專區設有多個互動遊戲及裝置，將遊戲融入學習中，以簡單的方式解釋複雜的金融概念。訪客的意見為正面。\n\n學生在資訊中心的政策專區試玩教育遊戲，以了解香港金融管理局的工作。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有六個翻譯版本都正確使用了詞彙表中的「學生」和「教育」，並準確傳達了原句的基本意思。然而，各版本在語法流暢度、語序自然度以及用詞選擇上存在差異。\n第一個翻譯版本語法正確，語序自然，使用「政策部門」一詞，雖然語義上略顯正式，但與「資訊中心」搭配仍屬合理。\n第二個翻譯版本語序略顯混亂，「在資訊中心政策部分的教育遊戲中嘗試」語意不清，「嘗試」與「試玩」語義重複，導致句子結構不清晰。\n第三個翻譯版本使用「政策組」，此詞在語義上與「政策部門」相近，但「組」一詞較常見於組織架構中，與「資訊中心」搭配稍顯不自然。\n第四個翻譯版本使用「政策專區」，此詞語更符合「policy section」的語境，「專區」一詞在公共場所或機構中常用，語感自然，語序流暢。\n第五個翻譯版本語序混亂，「在資訊中心政策部分的教育遊戲中試玩」語意重複，「試玩」與「在……中試玩」語義重複，導致句子結構不清晰。\n第六個翻譯版本使用「教育遊戲區」，此詞語語義明確，但與「試玩」搭配略顯冗長，語序稍顯不自然。\n綜合考量語法、語序、語感與語境，第四個翻譯版本最為自然流暢，使用「政策專區」一詞準確傳達了「policy section」的語義，語序清晰，語感自然，因此選為最佳翻譯。\n\n資訊中心為遊客舉辦導覽團。在這一年中，資訊中心接待了超過59,000名遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過650場導覽團（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，已有超過645,000名市民造訪資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽範疇旁邊，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行相關主題。它亦維持AIs及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及AIs證券從業人員的登記冊，根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"The library in the HKMA Information Centre.\" The task is to translate this into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese, ensuring that any terms in the dictionary are translated exactly as specified. However, in this case, the dictionary is empty, meaning there are no specific terms that require exact translation. Therefore, the focus is on producing a natural and accurate translation that reflects the original meaning.\nLooking at the translations provided by the junior translators, several versions are very similar. The first, fourth, and sixth translations all use \"香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館\" (The library in the HKMA Information Centre), which is concise and accurate. The third and fifth translations add \"內的\" (inside), which is slightly more verbose but still correct. The second translation uses \"香港按揭證券有限公司\" (Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited), which is incorrect because \"HKMA\" refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited.\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and reflect the original structure. \"香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館\" is the most direct and natural translation, matching the original structure and avoiding unnecessary words. It is also the most commonly used among the junior translators, indicating that it is widely accepted as the correct translation.\n**Improved Translation:**\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館。\n\n為接觸社區並提升公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2017年舉辦了四場公眾教育講座，約有2,000名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯匯制度、香港紙幣、銀行體系穩定、消費者保護、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路及金融行業職業發展。自1998年該公眾教育計劃推出以來，已有超過58,400名市民參與。\n\n來自不同區的中學學生與教師參與其中一場公開教育研討會。\n\n圖3 2017年資訊中心團體訪問類別\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培訓並維持一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它僱用員工的條件與公務員制度不同，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力保持精簡靈活的架構，並在可能的情況下，重新調配員工資源，以推動新計劃並應對日益增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n決議辦公室於2017年4月1日設立，以落實2016年6月頒佈的《金融機構（決議）條例》。該辦公室旨在保證香港的決議機制能為銀行有效運作。這對於加強香港銀行業在任何危機事件中的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人員配置\n\n2017年香港金融管理局的設立人數為927人。這將於2018年增加35人至962人（增幅為3.8%），以確保足夠資源得以提供，用以應付新措施及現有工作的繁重程度與工作量增加。新設職位將分派至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定，包括：\n– 加強支持推出「加快支付系統」及便捷銀行服務的能力；\n– 加強監管能力，以應對銀行在區域及業務上的擴張，並促進（i）在銀行服務提供中更廣泛採用金融科技，以及（ii）與其他監管機構在網絡安全及金融科技問題上的合作；以及\n– 支持「詐騙及洗錢情報專責小組」的工作，以打擊詐騙、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強法律支援，以確保反洗錢及SVFs相關法例下的法規執行行動。\n– 加強對交易所基金投資活動進一步擴張及多元化所需的投資、風險管理及其他相關支持。\n– 加強全球宏觀及金融部門監測，並強化人才發展計劃，以確保香港金融管理局擁有必要的專業人才，以應對機構長期發展所需。\n\n表1提供了香港金融管理局（HKMA）的設立和強大的詳細說明。\n\n表1 2018年1月1日香港金融管理局的設立及強大程度\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a title for a table, which should be concise and precise. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms: \"strength\" as \"強大\", \"2018\" as \"2018年\", \"Table\" as \"表\", \"January\" as \"1月\", and \"establishment\" as \"設立\". These must be used exactly as specified.\n1. **Translation 1** is concise but omits the full name of HKMA (\"香港金融管理局\"), which may be necessary for clarity, especially if the table is part of a document where the full name hasn't been introduced earlier.\n2. **Translation 2** includes \"金管局\" (HKMA), which is appropriate, but the date is written as \"2018年1月1日\" (correct), and the structure is natural. However, it uses \"於\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary for a title.\n3. **Translation 3** is the most complete, including the full name of HKMA and using \"強大程度\" for \"strength\", which is more precise than just \"強大\". However, \"強大程度\" may be more suitable for a descriptive context rather than a title.\n4. **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"香港按揭證券有限公司\" (HKMC) instead of \"香港金融管理局\" (HKMA), which is a critical error.\n5. **Translation 5** is missing the day (\"1日\") and uses \"與\" instead of \"及\", which is less formal and less suitable for a title.\n6. **Translation 6** is missing the day (\"1日\") and uses \"於\" which, while grammatically correct, is not as concise as needed for a table title.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Include the full name of HKMA (\"香港金融管理局\") for clarity.\n- Use the exact date \"2018年1月1日\" as specified.\n- Use \"設立及強大\" as per the dictionary.\n- Avoid unnecessary words like \"於\" or \"程度\" that may not be suitable for a title.\n- Ensure the structure is concise and natural in Traditional Chinese.\nThus, the improved translation should be:  \n**表1 2018年1月1日香港金融管理局的設立及強大**\n\n臨時資源被採用以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦會將借調的員工轉調至其他國際或本地組織，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工以全職或兼職方式被派往，為香港存款保障局和財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n臨時資源被採用以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦會將借調的員工轉調至其他國際或本地組織，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工以全職或兼職方式被派往，為香港存款保障局和財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n審視各譯本後，發現主要差異在於「review」一詞的翻譯，分別使用了「審查」、「審核」、「檢討」等詞彙。其中「審查」較符合「review」在制度性文件中的正式語境，而「審核」則偏向於具體資料的核對過程，「檢討」則帶有反思與改進之意，與「review」的語境稍有偏差。因此，選擇「審查」作為「review」的對應詞彙，較能準確傳達原文意涵。此外，所有譯本均正確使用了「薪酬」一詞，符合詞彙對應要求。最終選用「薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制」作為最佳譯本，既符合語境，又保持語句流暢與正式性。\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據治理小組委員會（GSC）透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）提供的意見，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並考慮現行市場水平及做法。薪酬包括總現金報酬及強積金計劃，實物福利極少。現金報酬包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及浮動薪金，後者可能視乎表現，每年以一次性方式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬由財務匯報局（FS）每年根據財務委員會（EFAC）向其提出的建議進行審閱，建議由公務員事務委員會（GSC）提供，審閱時會考慮GSC對HKMA在上一年度工作表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構為金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及其他任何有關因素。為保持薪酬的競爭力，可能會不時對個別工作表現優秀的員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的浮動薪酬發放，均根據個人表現發放給個別員工。HKMA的投資專業人員受浮動薪酬制度約束，該制度旨在鞏固其投資表現與薪酬發放之間的聯繫。高級總監及以上職級員工的薪酬調整及發放，由金融服務局（FS）根據顧問委員會（GSC）的意見批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬的會議中並不在場。總監以下職級員工的薪酬調整及發放，則由HKMA首席行政官在FS授權下，並在經批准的整體薪酬發放範圍內定出。\n\n# 高階員工的薪酬\n\n2017年高階員工的薪酬方案如表2所載。\n\n表2 2017年香港金融管理局高級職員的薪酬方案\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original English text, \"Table 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017.\" However, they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n1. **Translation 1** (\"表 2 2017 年 HKMA 高級成員薪酬方案\") is concise but uses \"HKMA\" without expanding it to \"香港金融管理局,\" which may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the acronym. It also uses \"成員\" for \"members,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"職員\" for \"staff members.\"\n2. **Translation 2** (\"表 2 香港金融管理局高級成員於2017年的薪酬方案\") expands \"HKMA\" to its full name, which is good for clarity. However, it uses \"成員\" again, which is less appropriate for \"staff members\" than \"職員.\" The phrase \"於2017年的\" is slightly awkward compared to \"2017年\" placed directly before the noun.\n3. **Translation 3** (\"表2 2017年香港金融管理局高級成員的薪酬安排\") is fluent and uses the correct full name of HKMA. However, it again uses \"成員\" instead of \"職員,\" and \"薪酬安排\" is slightly less precise than \"薪酬方案\" for \"remuneration packages.\"\n4. **Translation 4** (\"表2 2017年香港金融管理局高級職員成員薪酬方案\") is awkward in structure, combining \"高級職員成員\" which is redundant and unclear.\n5. **Translation 5** (\"表2 2017年香港金管局高級職員的薪酬待遇\") uses \"金管局\" instead of \"香港金融管理局,\" which is acceptable but less formal. It also uses \"薪酬待遇\" instead of \"薪酬方案,\" which is less precise for \"remuneration packages.\"\n6. **Translation 6** (\"表2 2017年金管局高級職員的薪酬方案\") is concise and uses the correct dictionary terms. However, it abbreviates \"香港金融管理局\" to \"金管局,\" which may be acceptable in some contexts but less formal than the full name.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"香港金融管理局\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"職員\" for \"staff members\" as it is more appropriate than \"成員.\"\n- Use \"薪酬方案\" for \"remuneration packages\" as it is the most precise term.\n- Place the year \"2017年\" directly before the noun for fluency.\nThus, the improved translation is:  \n**表2 2017年香港金融管理局高級職員的薪酬方案**\n\n# 管理培訓生（MT）及畢業經濟學家（GE）計劃\n\n為發展一批具備敏銳分析能力、強溝通技巧及良好團隊精神的年青人才，以從事中央銀行的長期職業，香港金融管理局（HKMA）運行兩項見習生計劃：MT 計劃及 GE 計劃。每個計劃的期長為兩年。\n\nMT 計劃為對中央銀行工作感興趣的年青畢業生提供培訓，使其成為香港金融管理局（HKMA）未來的關鍵管理人員，並為香港的金融穩定與繁榮作出貢獻。每位MT會在兩至三個部門接受實習培訓，以獲得有關HKMA重要職能的實際經驗。至於GE計劃，則為對經濟研究感興趣的年青畢業生提供機會，讓他們在兩至三個部門運用其研究技能，為政策制定過程提供重要意見。\n\nMT及GE計劃為受訓人員提供全方位的職業發展環境。除在職訓練外，MT及GE亦會參加由機構內部及領先的國際或地區機構舉辦的結構化根基中央銀行課程。在成功完成各自計劃後，MT將被聘任為經理，GE則被聘任為經濟學家，以繼續追求其在機構內的專業職業生涯。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.

外匯基金\n\n# 審計長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師的報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 評論\n\n我審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於第157至243頁所載的財務報表，其中包括聯匯基金及本集團截至2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收入及支出賬戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括顯著會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，各份財務報表真實及公平地反映基金及集團截至2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據行政長官根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條所發出的指示妥為編製。\n依我之見，財務報表帶來真實及公平地反映基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及截至該年終結的財務表現和現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）妥為編製，且已根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官指示取得。\n此譯文在語法和用詞上較為生硬，例如「帶來真實及公平地反映」語序不自然，且「香港會計準則」與原文「HKFRSs」不完全對應。此外，「外匯基金條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不一致，應為「交換基金條例」。\n依我之見，截至2017年12月31日止，基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，均在財務報表中真實及公平地反映，且根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發行的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並按照《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒佈的行政長官指示妥為編製。\n此譯文較為準確，但「儲備基金條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不一致，應為「交換基金條例」。此外，「財務狀況」與原文「financial position」雖有相似之意，但「財務地位」更貼切。\n依我之見，財務報表帶來一個真實且公允的視角，反映截至2017年12月31日基金及集團的財務地位，以及該年度終結時其財務表現及現金流，並按照香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）由香港特許會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發行，並已根據行政長官根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條制定的指示妥為編製。\n此譯文語句較為流暢，但「發行基金條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不一致，應為「交換基金條例」。此外，「帶來一個真實且公允的視角」語意略顯迂迴，可簡化為「真實及公平地反映」。\n依我之見，財務報表截至2017年12月31日，就基金及集團的財務地位，以及該年度結束時的財務表現及現金流量，均帶來真實及公平的觀點，並按照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）及根據財務司司長根據《財務司條例》（第66條）第7條頒佈的指示，已妥為編製。\n此譯文語序混亂，且「財務司條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不一致，應為「交換基金條例」。此外，「財務司司長」與原文「Chief Executive」不一致，應為「行政長官」。\n依我之見，財務報表已按照香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）發行，由香港特許會計師學會（「HKICPA」）所頒佈，並按照《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所訂的總督指令，妥為編製，並能真實、公平地反映基金及集團於2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流。\n此譯文語序混亂，且「總督指令」與原文「Chief Executive made under section 7」不一致，應為「行政長官根據第7條所發出的指示」。此外，「發行基金條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不一致，應為「交換基金條例」。\n依我之見，財務報表妥為呈現了基金及其截至2017年12月31日 的財務地位，以及該年終結時的財務表現和現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會（“HKICPA”）發行 的香港財務報告準則 (“HKFRSs”) 規定取得，且已按照行政長官根據《交換基金條例》(第66章)第7條發出的指示妥為擬備。\n此譯文語句較為流暢，但「規定取得」語意不清，應為「根據規定妥為編製」。此外，「擬備」與原文「prepared」不完全對應，應為「編製」。\n綜合上述譯文，最佳的改進方向為：確保語句流暢自然，使用準確的法律條文名稱，如「交換基金條例」，並正確使用「行政長官」而非「財務司司長」或「總督」。此外，應避免語序混亂，並確保「發行」、「妥為」、「按照」等關鍵詞正確使用。\n依我之見，財務報表真實及公平地反映基金及集團截至2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據行政長官根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條所發出的指示妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我按照首席執行官根據《財政儲備條例》第7條頒發的指示及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任進一步載於我的報告中「審計財務報表的審計師責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指在我專業判斷下，對2017年12月31日終結之財務報表審計而言最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表整體的背景下進行處理，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供單獨意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局肩負其他資訊的責任。其他資訊包括香港貨幣管理局2017年年度報告中所包括的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對此的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則顯得存在重大錯誤。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此事實。在這方面，我無任何內容需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會關於財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局肩負根據香港會計師公會發行的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條作出的指示，編製財務報表的責任，該財務報表需提供真實且公允的觀點，並建立貨幣管理局認為必要的內部控制措施，以確保財務報表無重大錯報，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局須肩負評估集團持續經營能力的責任，並在適用的情況下披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n貨幣基金顧問委員會的審計委員會肩負監督集團財務報告流程的責任。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate, but uses “程序” (procedure) instead of “流程” (process), which is slightly less natural in this context. Also, “貨幣基金” may not be the most precise term for “Exchange Fund.”\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses “審計小組委員會” (Audit Sub-Committee), which is closer to the original term “sub-committee.” However, “香港儲備基金諮詢委員會” is not the correct name for the “Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.”\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is very close to the correct version, using “匯換基金” for “Exchange Fund” and “流程” for “process.” However, “匯換基金” is not the standard term used in official contexts for the Exchange Fund.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses “聯匯基金” for “Exchange Fund,” which is also not the standard term. “監察” is a good synonym for “overseeing,” but “聯匯基金” is not the correct name.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** uses “審計子委員會” (Audit Sub-Committee), which is accurate. However, “證券交易所基金” is not the correct name for the “Exchange Fund.”\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses “審核委員會” (Audit Committee) instead of “審計委員會,” which is a minor but notable difference. Also, “監管” (regulate) is not the best synonym for “overseeing” in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for the “Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,” which is typically translated as “貨幣基金顧問委員會” in official contexts. The term “sub-committee” should be translated as “子委員會” to match the dictionary entry. The verb “responsible” is best translated as “肩負” as per the dictionary. The term “financial reporting process” should be translated as “財務報告流程” to reflect the natural flow of the process in Chinese.\nThus, the most accurate and natural translation is:\n**貨幣基金顧問委員會的審計子委員會肩負監督集團財務報告流程的責任。**\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任。\n審計師對財務報表審計的責任。\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所導致的重大錯報，並發行包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，一向能發現當存在重大錯報時的錯報。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或整體而言，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所導致的重大錯報，並發行包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，一向能發現當存在重大錯報時的錯報。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或整體而言，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：  \n- 識別並評估財務報表中因舞弊或錯誤導致重大錯報的風險，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險較因錯誤導致的風險為高，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制；  \n- 為了設計符合實際情況的審計程序，我需了解與審計相關的內部控制，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；  \n- 評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；  \n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或狀況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或若這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法持續經營；  \n- 評估財務報表整體的呈報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達到公平呈報的方式反映其底層交易和事件；以及  \n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表財務報表意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會就審計範圍及時間安排等事項進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何顯著內部控制缺陷在內的顯著審計結果。\n\n我亦向證券交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，提供相關保障。\n\n根據與基金會諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我釐定哪些事項在本期財務報表審計中具有最大重要性，並因此成為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（該基金）管理人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產全面匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的購入。運作範疇資訊載於附註30。\n\n# 2 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係按照所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個集體名稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師公會（HKICPA）發行的解釋，以及在香港一般公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（以下合稱「集團」）採用的重大會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行特定的新版及修訂版香港財務報告準則，這些準則於現時會計期間首期生效或可供提前採用。附註3提供資訊，說明因首次採用這些發展而導致的會計政策變更（如有），且這些變更與財務報表所反映的本集團現時及往期會計期間有關。\nThe original text discusses the issuance of new and revised HKFRSs by the HKICPA, their first effectiveness or availability for early adoption in the current accounting period, and the information provided in Note 3 regarding any changes in accounting policies resulting from the initial adoption of these developments, to the extent relevant to the Group for the current and prior periods reflected in the financial statements.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. The first junior translator used \"新股\" for \"initial,\" which is incorrect. \"新股\" means \"new shares,\" not \"initial.\" The translation is otherwise fluent but has this critical error.\n2. The second junior translator used \"首次\" for \"first\" and \"新股\" for \"initial,\" which is also incorrect. The sentence structure is somewhat awkward, and the use of \"新股\" is inappropriate.\n3. The third junior translator used \"一些\" for \"certain,\" which is acceptable, but \"這些發展\" for \"these developments\" is vague. The translation is generally clear but lacks precision in some areas.\n4. The fourth junior translator used \"特定\" for \"certain,\" \"首期\" for \"first,\" and \"早期採用\" for \"early adoption.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of the dictionary terms.\n5. The fifth junior translator used \"不詳\" for \"available,\" which is incorrect. \"不詳\" means \"unknown\" or \"not specified,\" not \"available.\" The translation is otherwise coherent but has this critical error.\n6. The sixth junior translator used \"新股\" for \"initial,\" which is incorrect. The sentence structure is awkward, and the translation lacks clarity in some parts.\nReasoning for the improved translation:\n- \"certain\" should be translated as \"特定.\"\n- \"initial\" should be translated as \"首次.\"\n- \"developments\" should be translated as \"發展.\"\n- \"reflected\" should be translated as \"反映.\"\n- \"adoption\" should be translated as \"採用.\"\n- \"current\" should be translated as \"現時.\"\n- \"provides\" should be translated as \"提供.\"\n- \"issued\" should be translated as \"發行.\"\n- \"available\" should be translated as \"可供.\"\n- \"resulting\" should be translated as \"導致.\"\n- \"relevant\" should be translated as \"有關.\"\n- \"first\" should be translated as \"首.\"\n- \"period\" should be translated as \"期.\"\nThe improved translation should use these terms accurately, maintain fluency, and ensure that the meaning of the original text is clearly conveyed in natural Traditional Chinese.\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，亦包括集團對聯營公司及合資企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合資企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債按其公允價值計量外，其餘均按歷史成本計量：  \n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；  \n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；  \n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；  \n- 黃金（附註2.11）；以及  \n- 投資性不動產（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告數額。這些估計和相關假設是根據經驗和多個其他因素而制定，這些因素在當時的情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了對資產和負債的帳面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他資料來源中並不顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n這些估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若修訂僅影響該期，則會計估計的修訂會在該期認可；若修訂同時影響現時及未來期，則會在修訂期及未來期認可。\n\n附註18包含有關投資性不動產公允價值估計的相關假設。附註36包含有關金融工具公允價值估計的相關假設。除涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，在應用集團會計政策時，沒有其他關鍵會計判斷參與。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而暴露於或擁有來自該實體的浮動回報之權利，且能透過對該實體的實力影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有實力時，僅考慮實質性權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n"}
