{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n#

The Omicron variant of COVID-19 spread widely, continuing to put pressure on global economic growth while inflation pressures also continued to rise. Following this, a conflict broke out between Russia and Ukraine, further increasing inflation pressures and prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies. This widened volatility in global financial markets and heightened the risk of slowing economic growth. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic broke out, with a rapid rise in infection cases, further impacting the economy. Meanwhile, negative reports surrounding pandemic prevention measures and quarantine restrictions further led to misunderstandings about Hong Kong, threatening its reputation as an international financial centre. For the whole year, Hong Kong's real GDP contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, and has advanced multiple measures conducive to development in key strategic areas, further consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. After three years of travel restrictions, we successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully resumed normalcy, allowing travelers to once again visit Hong Kong in person to experience it. The HKMA held the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" in November last year, with financial leaders from around the world attending the event in person. The enthusiastic response from the international community serves as the best possible proof that Hong Kong has fully resumed normalcy.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains filled with unprecedented uncertainty. Despite this, the resumption of economic activity on the Mainland will reinvigorate Hong Kong and the entire region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to remain steadfast in its role, fulfilling its function of maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, and actively seeking more opportunities beneficial to Hong Kong's development, thereby demonstrating and enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. We will also continue to contribute to enhancing global climate resilience and sustainable development. This year, in addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will also publish the 2022 Sustainable Development Report to provide a more detailed introduction of the HKMA's various initiatives undertaken to enhance Hong Kong's status as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Systems: As Strong as Ever\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, “貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔,” is a concise and formal heading, likely from a report or policy document. The key terms to be translated are “貨幣,” “金融,” “體系,” and “如昔,” each with specific dictionary options.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   *“Monetary and financial systems: remains intact.”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses “monetary” and “financial systems” from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “remains intact” is grammatically incorrect in this context (should be “remain intact” or “remains intact” with a subject). Also, the colon usage is inconsistent with the original title’s structure.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   *“Monetary and Financial Systems: Remain Intact”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Proper capitalization and use of “Remain Intact” as a title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Remain Intact” is a bit abrupt and lacks the nuance of “as strong as ever” or “as before.”\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   *“# Monetary and Financial System: As Strong as Ever”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “As Strong as Ever” effectively, which is a natural and idiomatic expression in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of “System” (singular) may not match the original “體系,” which is more appropriately translated as “systems” (plural) in this context. Also, the hashtag is unnecessary unless the original text included it for formatting.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   *“Monetary and financial systems: remains intact.”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same grammatical issue with “remains intact.”\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   *“Currency and Financial System: Remains Intact”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “Currency” from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Currency” is less appropriate than “monetary” in this context. Also, “System” is singular, which may not match the original.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   *“Monetary and Financial Systems: Remains Intact as Before”*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “Remains Intact as Before,” which is a natural and accurate translation of “堅穩如昔.”  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Remains Intact as Before” is slightly wordy and less idiomatic than “As Strong as Ever.”\n**Improved Translation:**\nMonetary and Financial Systems: As Strong as Ever\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\" and use the term consistently.\n- The term \"weak-side exchange guarantee\" or \"weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" is used appropriately, aligning with the dictionary entry for \"弱方兌換保證.\"\n- The phrase \"aggressive monetary tightening\" is a strong and accurate rendering of \"大幅收緊貨幣政策.\"\n- The use of \"a total of HK$242.1 billion\" is consistent with the dictionary entry for \"億\" and the numerical value.\n- The term \"mechanism\" is used correctly in the context of \"既定機制.\"\n- The phrase \"in an orderly and transparent manner\" is well-chosen and aligns with the dictionary entry for \"具透明度.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"money markets\" instead of \"currency markets\" or \"money market,\" which may not be as precise in the context of the Hong Kong financial system.\n- The term \"Convertibility Undertaking\" is used in some translations, but the original text refers to \"弱方兌換保證,\" which is more accurately translated as \"weak-side exchange guarantee.\"\n- The phrase \"the system's resilience\" in one translation is slightly less formal than \"the resilience of the LERS.\"\n- Some translations use \"function smoothly\" instead of \"operate smoothly,\" which is less idiomatic in this context.\n- The term \"currency markets\" is used in one translation, but \"money markets\" is more standard in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"weak-side exchange guarantee\" consistently, as it is the most direct and accurate translation of \"弱方兌換保證.\"\n- The phrase \"in an orderly and transparent manner\" should be used to reflect the dictionary entry for \"具透明度.\"\n- The term \"money market\" should be used instead of \"currency markets\" or \"financial markets\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- The phrase \"operated smoothly\" is more idiomatic than \"functioned smoothly\" or \"worked smoothly.\"\n- The term \"mechanism\" should be used in the context of \"the established mechanism\" to reflect the dictionary entry for \"機制.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been in place since its implementation in 1983, successfully weathering various external shocks across multiple economic cycles. In 2022, the resilience of the LERS was once again demonstrated. Under the aggressive monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve (the Fed), the weak-side exchange guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner, according to the established mechanism. During this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System stems from its sound foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund in its \"2022 Report on the External Sector,\" the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System is based on multiple factors, including transparent operational rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal arrangements, robust financial regulation, and an agile economic structure.\n\nWe深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to a robust mechanism, striving to communicate with the public and markets to deepen their understanding of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), conducting effective market monitoring, and making contingency plans for different scenarios all help to consolidate confidence in the LERS among all sectors. Our social media campaigns launched to promote understanding of the LERS' operational mechanism have helped effectively maintain market confidence in the LERS even when the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) was triggered multiple times during the year. Internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also effectively utilizes data analytics technology to enhance market monitoring, enabling us to respond timely to the latest market conditions.\n\nDuring the year, despite facing macro-level challenges and increasing credit risks, the Hong Kong banking system remained robust, with capital and liquidity being very ample. At the end of 2022, the comprehensive total capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.1%, far higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks slightly rose to 162.3%, also far above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system slightly deteriorated, with the specific classified loan ratio rising to 1.38% at the end of 2022. However, this level remained robust and was below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Operational Resilience\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"the escalation of geopolitical tensions\" and \"tightening of monetary policies\" accurately. It also correctly uses \"supporting the economy\" from the dictionary. However, \"remained stable\" is slightly less precise than \"remained robust\" or \"remained sound.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has some grammatical issues, such as \"continue to play\" (should be \"continued to play\"). It also uses \"sufficiently prudent\" from the dictionary, which is acceptable, but \"remained robust\" is better than \"remained robust, continue to play.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"heating up of geopolitical tensions\" (though \"escalation\" is more formal), and \"tightening of monetary policies\" is correct. It also uses \"supporting the economy\" from the dictionary. However, \"has remained stable\" is slightly less precise than \"has remained robust.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"rising geopolitical tensions\" and \"tightening of monetary policies\" correctly. It also uses \"remained robust\" and \"play a key role in supporting the economy,\" which are accurate and natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is grammatically sound but slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"challenges from different aspects have all increased.\" It also uses \"remained robust\" and \"play a role in supporting the economy,\" which are acceptable but not the most precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"escalation of geopolitical tensions\" and \"tightening of monetary policies\" correctly. It also uses \"remained stable\" and \"continues to play a key role in supporting the economy.\" However, \"remained stable\" is slightly less precise than \"remained robust.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Escalation of geopolitical tensions\" is more formal and precise than \"heating up\" or \"rising.\"\n- \"Tightening of monetary policies\" is the most accurate phrasing from the dictionary.\n- \"Remained robust\" is more precise than \"remained stable\" in the context of a banking system.\n- \"Play a key role in supporting the economy\" is more natural and precise than \"play a role in supporting the economy.\"\n- \"Hong Kong’s banking system\" is more natural than \"the Hong Kong banking system.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued for three years, with challenges from all aspects intensifying, such as the escalation of geopolitical tensions and major central banks tightening monetary policies. However, thanks to years of prudent risk management and effective regulation, Hong Kong’s banking system has remained robust and continues to play a key role in supporting the economy.\n\nOver the past year, a major regulatory challenge has been ensuring that banks continue to provide the necessary support to customers while maintaining robust credit risk management, amid ongoing economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" plan has been further extended and now includes a voluntary partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers to choose to start repaying part of the principal, helping customers prepare for eventually resuming normal repayments.\n\nIn response to major economies sharply tightening monetary policies, which intensified market volatility, another key regulatory task for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2022 was to strengthen the monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impacts of synchronized tightening of monetary policies across major economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios for stress tests to evaluate banks' resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. In terms of operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities, we provide guidance to assist banks in developing comprehensive and holistic operational frameworks to achieve sound operations, and also provide detailed supervisory guidance on specific operational areas of banks, for example, issuing guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the growing popularity of cloud technology. Additionally, in response to the accelerated development of digitalization, we have also strengthened efforts to address \"phishing\" scams and to advance consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also striving to promote financial inclusion and enhance the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call for providing basic banking services, with some banks establishing branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in new development areas. Affected by travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to use their Mainland bank accounts. In view of this, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to help restart about 500,000 Mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to avoid the need to personally visit the Mainland to handle the matter.\n\nAnother area of strategic importance for the sustained development of the banking sector is enhancing professional capabilities. To expand its business, the banking sector continues to have a large demand for professional talents. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, building on its talent development strategy — \"Connecting Talent with the Future\" — launched a series of measures over the past year to assist the banking sector in attracting, cultivating, and retaining talent, focusing on enhancing and retraining the skills of existing staff members, as well as nurturing the younger generation, in order to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International Financial Centre: Hong Kong Returns to the International Stage!\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural appropriateness.\nFirstly, the use of \"multi-faceted efforts\" and \"concerted efforts\" is appropriate, but \"multi-faceted\" may be slightly more verbose than necessary. \"Efforts\" alone or \"extensive efforts\" may be more concise and natural in this context.\nSecondly, the term \"8-number typhoon signal\" in the fourth and sixth translations is not standard. The correct term should be \"No. 8 typhoon signal\" as used in the other translations.\nThirdly, the phrase \"attending in person in Hong Kong\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"attending in person in Hong Kong\" or \"attending in person in Hong Kong.\"\nFourthly, the use of \"disseminating a powerful message\" in the fourth translation is slightly less natural than \"sending a strong message\" or \"conveying a strong message.\"\nFifthly, the phrase \"bringing Hong Kong back onto the international stage\" is slightly more natural than \"restoring Hong Kong to the international stage.\"\nLastly, the use of \"officials\" in the fifth translation may not be the best choice, as the original text refers to \"responsible persons\" or \"leaders\" of the institutions, not necessarily government officials.\nTaking these observations into account, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and natural phrasings from the junior translators' work, ensuring that all terms from the dictionary are correctly translated and that the overall text is fluent and natural in English.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is as follows:\nThe pandemic-related travel restrictions, which had been in place for a prolonged period, were gradually lifted in 2022, and we made extensive efforts to bring Hong Kong back onto the international stage. The \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" held in November attracted over 200 international and regional leaders from global financial institutions to attend in person in Hong Kong, receiving attention and enthusiastic responses from around the world. Despite the summit coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, the summit was still highly successful, conveying a strong message that Hong Kong has fully resumed normalcy and is demonstrating unprecedented vitality and energy. We are pleased to see the positive ripple effects of the summit, with many global financial institutions and international organizations currently holding or planning to hold various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have come to appreciate the importance of face-to-face communication. Therefore, we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international forums, actively participate in global policy discussions, and take the opportunity of overseas visits to meet with the management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the various opportunities Hong Kong offers under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have come to appreciate the importance of face-to-face communication. Therefore, we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international forums, actively participate in global policy discussions, and take the opportunity of overseas visits to meet with the management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the various opportunities Hong Kong offers under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial centre, we continue to expand new frontiers in strategic priority areas such as fintech, Mainland opportunities, and green and sustainable finance. We also further strengthen Hong Kong's financial platform, providing top-tier services to attract more enterprises to establish themselves in Hong Kong. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Financial Technology\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress in all five areas in 2022.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original sentence is concise and factual, reporting on progress made in 2022 following the 2021 announcement of a strategy. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in phrasing and accuracy.\n- **Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, using \"made significant progress\" and \"all five areas.\" It is a strong candidate.\n- **Translation 2** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with \"achieved significant progress\" instead of \"made.\" Both are acceptable, but \"made\" is slightly more natural in this context.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"disclosure of information\" for \"公布,\" which is overly literal and less natural than \"announced.\" It also uses \"marked progress,\" which is acceptable but less common than \"significant progress.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"2025 Financial Technology Strategy\" instead of \"FinTech 2025,\" which is less concise and less commonly used in official contexts. It also adds a comma after \"June 2021,\" which is unnecessary.\n- **Translation 5** is identical to Translation 1 and is therefore equally strong.\n- **Translation 6** incorrectly translates \"金融科技\" as \"Financial\" instead of \"FinTech\" and uses \"all areas\" instead of \"all five areas,\" which is less precise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FinTech 2025\" as it is the standard term and more concise.\n- Use \"made significant progress\" as it is natural and commonly used in such contexts.\n- Ensure \"all five areas\" is used to match the original's specificity.\n- Avoid overly literal translations like \"disclosure of information\" for \"公布.\"\n- Maintain a clear and concise structure without unnecessary punctuation or wordiness.\n**Final Translation:**\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress in all five areas in 2022.\n\nWe have achieved ideal results in our work on \"comprehensively promoting the digitalization of banking.\" According to the results of the fintech application assessment, the Hong Kong banking sector has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, and the categories of technology adopted have also continued to increase. Since 2017, our progressive promotion and support of digitalization efforts have received active responses from banks and have continued to yield encouraging results. We will continue to closely cooperate with the industry, and based on the assessment results, further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and foster the development of individual technology categories.\n\nDuring the year, our work on central bank digital currency has advanced to an important new milestone. The \"Multi-CBDC Cross-border Network\" (mBridge) project has entered the pilot phase and has become one of the first central bank digital currency projects globally to conduct real settlement for cross-border corporate transactions. At the retail level, the technical testing of cross-border use of digital renminbi has entered its second phase, primarily testing the topping up of digital renminbi wallets through \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS). Regarding digital Hong Kong dollar, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the potential issuance of digital Hong Kong dollar in the future, and launch the second track pilot program, inviting the industry to conduct in-depth research into feasible application scenarios for digital Hong Kong dollar.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of financial technology. The \"Commercial Data Link,\" launched in October last year, is a significant step in enhancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure. As a data-sharing infrastructure based on authorizations from data owners, \"Commercial Data Link\" enables financial institutions to conveniently extract commercial data of enterprises, helping enterprises (especially small and medium-sized enterprises) to more easily obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, \"Commercial Data Link\" has facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, with a total amount exceeding HK$1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the necessity to monitor and properly address the risks that may arise from related developments. We are closely monitoring developments in the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the opinions collected through public consultation and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" to establish the regulatory framework for stablecoins and define their regulatory scope. In the future, we will prioritize regulating stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more statutory currencies, as these stablecoins may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with the establishment of appropriate regulations, the industry will be able to more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector are actively preparing for this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Mainland Opportunities\n"}

Highlights of 2022\n\n# Economy and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy significantly contracted in 2022, affected by multiple adverse factors including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightening financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labor market initially deteriorated before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full re-opening between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nThe original text discusses the stability and health of Hong Kong's banking system in 2022, emphasizing its capital and liquidity positions, as well as the quality of its assets. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, which must be used exactly as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"robust\" for \"穩健\" and \"positions\" for \"狀況.\" However, \"remained robust\" is slightly less natural than \"remained robust\" or \"remained stable.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"robustness\" for \"穩健,\" which is less natural than \"robust\" or \"stable.\" Also, \"conditions\" for \"狀況\" is not the best fit; \"positions\" is more appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"remained robust,\" \"positions,\" and \"continuing to remain at a healthy level.\" However, \"remained robust\" is slightly less natural than \"remained robust.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"banking system.\" The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses \"remained robust,\" \"positions,\" and \"continuing to remain at a healthy level.\" It also uses \"Hong Kong's\" for \"香港,\" which is appropriate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is problematic. It uses \"remains robust\" and \"remained buffers,\" which are not accurate. \"Buffers\" is not a correct translation for \"充,\" and the sentence structure is awkward.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong's banking system\" for \"香港銀行體系,\" \"remained robust\" for \"繼續保持穩健,\" \"capital and liquidity positions\" for \"資本及流動性狀況,\" and \"asset quality continuing to remain at a healthy level\" for \"資產質素繼續處於健康水平.\" It should also use \"2022\" as specified in the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHong Kong's banking system remained robust in 2022, with capital and liquidity positions remaining ample, and asset quality continuing to remain at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nAs the US tightened monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar softened, and the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered multiple times during the year. However, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate smoothly and orderly, repeatedly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices of various asset classes declining simultaneously. The Exchange Fund recorded an overall rate of return of -4.5%, which was relatively mild compared to the performance of most diversified asset funds in the market.\n\nThe HKMA also continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Banking system stability\nThe original text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking system stability\" when using the dictionary terms. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, but there are some nuances to consider.\nThe term \"體系\" is translated as \"system\" in most translations, which is appropriate. However, \"sector\" is also a valid alternative, and in the context of \"銀行體系,\" \"banking sector\" might be more natural in some contexts. However, \"system\" is more precise here, as it refers to the internal structure and operations of the banking industry.\n\"銀行\" is translated as \"banking\" or \"banking sector\" in most translations, which is correct. However, \"banking system\" is more specific and accurate in this context, as it refers to the entire structure and operations of the banking industry.\n\"穩定\" is translated as \"stability\" in most translations, which is the most direct and appropriate translation. \"Stabilising\" and \"maintaining... stability\" are also valid, but they are more complex and less direct than \"stability.\"\nThe most accurate and natural translation of the original text is \"Banking system stability.\" This translation uses the most appropriate terms from the dictionary and conveys the meaning of the original text accurately and naturally in English.\n\nIn the face of increasing volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened its supervision of banks' credit and market risk management, and is working closely with banks to enhance the resilience of their operations and their cyber defense capabilities, in light of the continued rise in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA has further introduced consumer protection measures relating to \"buy now, pay later\" products and additional property transfer payment arrangements. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory institutions to formulate a regulatory framework for virtual assets, and has issued guidance on the distribution of investment products and launched a new trust business regulatory system. The \"credit data platform\" under the \"multiple credit data service institutions\" model concerning personal credit data has also been activated during the year.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) ongoing efforts to enhance the anti-money laundering (AML) ecosystem, combat terrorist financing, respond to fraud, and promote the use of data and technology through initiatives like the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory.\" The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"anti-terrorism and counter-financing of terrorism\" which is redundant and not aligned with the original. Also, \"Regtech oversight\" is not a direct match for the term in the original text. The translation is somewhat fluent but lacks precision.\n2. **Second Translation:** Accurately uses \"anti-money laundering (AML)\" and \"financing of terrorism.\" It correctly identifies \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" and uses \"accelerates the HKMA's efforts in adopting regulatory technology.\" However, it omits the term \"ecosystem\" in the first part, which is crucial for the intended meaning.\n3. **Third Translation:** Correctly uses \"AML\" and \"counter-financing of terrorism.\" It includes \"ecosystem\" and \"response measures against fraud.\" However, \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory\" is overly long and not the most concise version.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"AML\" and \"financing of terrorism\" correctly. It includes \"response measures against fraud cases\" and \"RegTech\" appropriately. The phrase \"accelerates the pace of the HKMA's adoption of RegTech\" is fluent and accurate.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Similar to the fourth, but uses \"targeting terrorist financing\" which is slightly off from the original. It also uses \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory\" which is accurate but verbose.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"Regtech oversight\" incorrectly and \"Data\" with a capital D, which is not standard. It also uses \"accelerate\" without the correct form \"accelerates\" and omits \"ecosystem\" in the first part.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the original meaning, including the AML ecosystem, counter-financing of terrorism, response to fraud, and the use of data and technology.\n- Use the correct terms from the dictionary, such as \"AML,\" \"RegTech,\" \"ecosystem,\" and \"pace.\"\n- Be fluent and natural in English, avoiding redundancy and overly long phrases.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering (AML) ecosystem, which combats money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and to strengthen measures in response to fraud cases. It also further promotes the application of data and technology through the \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" series, and accelerates the pace of the HKMA’s adoption of RegTech in its AML work.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards, locally. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also worked together with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance the skills of staff members for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) formulated new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all systemically important local banks, marking a significant milestone in the development of the resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre Status\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit achieved success, consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and creating positive ripple effects.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (e.g., People's Bank of China, Hong Kong Monetary Authority) and use appropriate terms like \"Swap Connect\" and \"Dual Counter Market Making mechanism.\"\n- Most translations use \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"enhance\/optimized\" for \"優化,\" which aligns with the dictionary options.\n- The term \"人民幣\" is consistently translated as \"renminbi\" or \"RMB,\" which is appropriate.\n- The phrase \"雙櫃台莊家機制\" is accurately translated as \"Dual Counter Market Making mechanism\" in several translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"enhanced\" for \"優化\" without the nuance of ongoing or planned optimization, which is better captured by \"will be optimized\" or \"optimized during the year.\"\n- The term \"貨幣互換協議\" is translated as \"monetary swap agreement\" or \"currency swap agreement.\" While both are acceptable, \"currency swap agreement\" is more standard in financial contexts.\n- The term \"債務工具中央結算系統\" is translated as \"Central Clearing System for Debt Instruments\" in some translations, which is accurate, but \"Central Clearing and Settlement System\" is more precise and aligns with the term \"結算.\"\n- The term \"亞洲區\" is translated as \"Asia\" in most translations, which is acceptable, but \"in Asia\" is more natural than \"in the Asia region.\"\n- Some translations use \"financial regulator\" for \"金管局,\" which is not the exact term. The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- The term \"監管機構\" is translated as \"regulatory bodies\" or \"regulatory authorities,\" which is correct, but \"regulatory institutions\" is more precise.\n- The term \"籌備開通\" is translated as \"prepare for the launch,\" which is accurate, but \"prepare to launch\" is more concise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"currency swap agreement\" for \"貨幣互換協議.\"\n- Use \"will be optimized\" for \"年內優化.\"\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\"\n- Use \"regulatory institutions\" for \"監管機構.\"\n- Use \"Central Clearing and Settlement System\" for \"債務工具中央結算系統.\"\n- Use \"in Asia\" for \"亞洲區.\"\n- Use \"Dual Counter Market Making mechanism\" for \"雙櫃台莊家機制.\"\n- Use \"renminbi-denominated\" for \"人民幣計價.\"\n- Use \"striving to develop\" for \"致力發展.\"\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be optimized during the year, further consolidating Hong Kong's status as a global offshore renminbi business hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also cooperating with other regulatory institutions and stakeholders to prepare to launch \"Swap Connect\" and to introduce a Dual Counter Market Making mechanism to support the trading of renminbi-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. It is also striving to develop the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\nGood progress has been made in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, as well as green and sustainable finance areas.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance fluency, grammatical correctness, and consistency with the dictionary terms.\n1. **\"Enhancing\" vs. \"Strengthening\":** While both are acceptable, \"strengthening\" is more commonly used in formal contexts related to competitiveness and is more aligned with the tone of the original text.\n2. **\"Platform\":** The dictionary provides multiple options, including \"platform,\" \"Platform,\" and \"platforms.\" The use of \"Platform\" with a capital \"P\" is inconsistent unless it refers to a specific named platform. The original text does not indicate a specific named platform, so \"financial platform\" with lowercase is more appropriate.\n3. **\"Corporate treasury centres\":** The term \"corporate\" is correctly used, but \"treasury centres\" should be \"treasury centres\" (with \"centres\" as per the dictionary, which includes \"centres\" and \"centers\"). The use of \"corporate treasury centres\" is grammatically correct but could be more concise as \"corporate treasury centres\" or \"corporate treasury centers\" depending on regional preference.\n4. **\"Green and sustainable finance areas\":** The term \"areas\" is acceptable, but \"areas such as\" or \"including\" might be more natural in English. However, the original uses \"涵蓋\" which is best translated as \"covering,\" so \"covering... areas\" is appropriate.\n5. **Consistency in capitalization:** Some translations use \"Platform\" with a capital \"P\" without justification, which can be misleading unless it refers to a specific entity. The original text does not indicate a specific named platform, so \"financial platform\" with lowercase is more appropriate.\n6. **Fluency and natural phrasing:** The phrase \"Made good progress\" in the fourth translation is less formal and less natural than \"Good progress has been made.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"strengthening\" for \"加強,\" \"financial platform\" with lowercase, \"bond issuance,\" \"asset and wealth management,\" \"corporate treasury centres,\" and \"green and sustainable finance areas.\" It should also maintain grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\n\nThe HKMA also continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting the adoption of fintech within the financial industry and enhancing Hong Kong's status as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System \"FPS\" has seen steady growth in adoption as its functionalities improve.\n\n# Functions of Institutions\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, with the goal of enhancing public understanding of its policies and work.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"society and the market\" and \"enhancing the public's understanding.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, but \"society\" may be too broad; \"community\" might be more precise in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"the community and the market\" and \"enhancing the public's understanding.\" This is very close to the best possible translation. The use of \"community\" is more specific than \"society,\" and the structure is natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"the community and market\" and \"enhancing the public's understanding.\" The translation is fluent, but \"market\" is singular, which may not fully capture the plural nature of the original term. Also, \"the Authority\" is used instead of \"the HKMA,\" which is less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"the public and the market.\" While grammatically correct, \"the public\" may not fully align with the original term \"社會\" (society), which is more about the broader community rather than the general public.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"the community and markets\" and \"enhancing the public’s understanding.\" This is very strong. The use of \"markets\" (plural) aligns with the original term \"市場,\" and \"enhancing the public’s understanding\" is natural and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"effective links\" instead of \"effective communication.\" While \"links\" is a valid translation for \"聯繫,\" \"communication\" is more natural in this context. The rest of the translation is strong.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"community\" for \"社會\" (as it is more specific and natural in this context), \"markets\" for \"市場\" (plural, as the original term is plural), and \"enhancing the public’s understanding\" for \"提升公眾對...的了解.\" The phrase \"maintains effective communication\" is more natural than \"maintains effective links\" or \"maintains effective contact.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with the community and markets through different channels, enhancing the public’s understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has carefully established a team emphasizing agile adaptability and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to address changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

2022 Annual Major Events Summary\n\n# Currency Stability\n\n# May 26th\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, where the structure is \"Month + Day\" with the month and day written in numerical form. The dictionary provides multiple options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), including both full names and abbreviations. However, in this context, the most appropriate translations are \"May\" for \"5月\" and \"26th\" for \"26日.\"\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"May 26th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately reflects the date format and uses the correct ordinal form for the day.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a fluent and natural translation.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# May 26\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct month and day.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and does not appear in the original text. It may be a formatting error or misunderstanding.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"May 26\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly translates the month and day.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The day is not in ordinal form (\"26th\"), which is more natural in English for dates.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"May 26th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation, accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# May 26th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly translates the date.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and may be a formatting error.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"May 26th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**  \nThe most natural and fluent translation in English would be \"May 26th,\" as it correctly uses the ordinal form for the day and avoids unnecessary symbols like \"#.\" The use of \"26th\" is more appropriate in English date formats than \"26\" alone, especially when the date is written in full. The original text does not include any formatting symbols, so they should not be added in the translation. The dictionary confirms that \"5月\" should be translated as \"May\" and \"26日\" as \"26th.\"\n**Final Translation:**  \nMay 26th\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about a government action, and the translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"bonds\" for 債券 and \"Institutional Bond Issuance Program\" for 「機構債券發行計劃」. However, it uses \"HK$5 billion\" instead of \"HK$500 million,\" which is incorrect based on the dictionary entry for 億, which specifies \"billion\" as the correct term. This is a critical error.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with the same issue of using \"HK$5 billion\" instead of \"HK$500 million.\" It also uses \"Programme\" with a British spelling, which is acceptable but inconsistent with the dictionary's use of \"Program.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation incorrectly uses \"HK$500 million\" instead of \"HK$5 billion,\" which is the opposite of the correct translation. It also uses \"tenor\" for 期, which is acceptable but less common in this context than \"maturity\" or \"term.\" The phrase \"for the first time via tender\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is more detailed, using \"face value of HK$500 million,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"government\" in lowercase, which is not appropriate for referring to the Hong Kong Government. The term \"tenor\" is used again, which is acceptable but not the most natural in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the correct one, using \"HK$500 million\" and \"Institutional Bond Issuance Program.\" However, it uses \"in\" instead of \"of\" for 的, which is not ideal. The phrase \"in 20-year Hong Kong dollar government bonds\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Plan\" instead of \"Program\" and incorrectly uses \"5 billion\" instead of \"500 million.\" It also uses \"by tender\" instead of \"through a tender process,\" which is less formal and less precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The correct amount is \"HK$500 million\" based on the dictionary entry for 億.\n- The correct term for 債券 is \"bonds.\"\n- The correct term for 「機構債券發行計劃」 is \"Institutional Bond Issuance Program.\"\n- The correct term for 期 is \"20-year term\" or \"20-year maturity.\"\n- The correct term for 政府 is \"Government.\"\n- The correct term for 發行 is \"issued\" or \"issuance.\"\n- The correct term for 下 is \"under.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\n**The Government issued, for the first time under the \"Institutional Bond Issuance Program,\" HK$500 million in 20-year Hong Kong dollar government bonds through a tender process.**\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the optimization of the currency swap agreement, changing it to a standing agreement format, eliminating the need for renewal, and expanding the agreement's scale from the original 500 billion yuan\/590 billion Hong Kong dollars to 800 billion yuan\/940 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\n# July 13\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an updated commitment statement regarding the Global Foreign Exchange Market Standards, thereby reiterating its commitment to adhere to the updated version of the standards when acting as a market participant in the foreign exchange market.\n\n# July 22nd\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局公布優化人民幣流動資金安排，包括擴大規模及簡化操作。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the optimized RMB liquidity arrangements, including expanding the scale and simplifying operations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of \"simplifying operations\" and \"expanding the scale.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Optimized\" is not the best choice for \"優化\" in this context; \"optimization\" or \"enhancements\" would be more natural. Also, \"RMB\" is acceptable, but \"People’s (Bank of China)\" is not relevant here.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced enhancements to renminbi liquidity funding arrangements, including large-scale streamlining and simplifying operational means.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"enhancements\" and \"streamlining\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Large-scale streamlining\" is not in the original text. \"Operational means\" is overly literal and awkward.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The HKMA announced the optimization of the renminbi liquidity facility arrangements, including expanding the scale and streamlining operations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"streamlining operations\" and \"optimization\" well.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Facility arrangements\" is not a standard term. \"HKMA\" is acceptable but less formal than \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The HKMA announced the optimization of RMB liquidity arrangements, including expanding the scale and streamlining operations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Clear, concise, and accurate. Uses \"streamlining operations\" and \"optimization\" well.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" is acceptable but less formal than the full name.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority publishes enhancements to renminbi liquidity funding arrangements, including expanding the scale and streamlining operational means.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"enhancements\" and \"streamlining.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Publishes\" is not the best fit for \"公布.\" \"Operational means\" is awkward and not idiomatic.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the optimization of renminbi liquidity funds arrangements, including expanding the scale and simplifying operations.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"optimization\" and \"simplifying operations.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Funds arrangements\" is not a standard term. \"Simplifying\" is acceptable but \"streamlining\" is more natural in this context.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"優化\" is best translated as **\"optimization\"** or **\"enhancements\"**. \"Optimization\" is more precise in this context.\n- \"人民幣\" should be **\"RMB\"** (the standard abbreviation).\n- \"流動資金\" is best translated as **\"liquidity arrangements\"** or **\"liquidity funding arrangements.\"**\n- \"簡化操作\" is best translated as **\"streamlining operations\"**.\n- \"公布\" is best translated as **\"announced\"**.\n- \"包括\" is best translated as **\"including\"**.\n- \"擴大規模\" is best translated as **\"expanding the scale\"**.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the optimization of RMB liquidity arrangements, including expanding the scale and streamlining operations.\n\n# Banking System\n# Banking System\n\n# January 28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a joint circular providing updated guidance to intermediaries engaged in virtual asset-related activities to protect clients.\n\n# January 28\n\nThe original sentence is a formal regulatory statement, and the translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"regulatory guidance\" and correctly placing the focus on \"money laundering and terrorist financing.\" However, it omits \"bank management\" as a separate element, which is part of the original structure.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and uses \"supervisory guidance\" as required. It includes \"banking management\" and correctly places the focus on the risks. However, it uses \"money laundering and terrorist financing risks\" as a compound phrase, which slightly alters the original structure.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate, using \"supervisory guidance\" and correctly listing the elements. However, it omits \"bank management\" as a separate component, which is part of the original sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is more verbose and slightly awkward in structure. It uses \"the management of banks\" instead of \"bank management,\" which is not as precise. It also uses \"financing of terrorism\" instead of \"terrorist financing,\" which is less standard in regulatory contexts.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"counter-financing of terrorism\" as per the dictionary. It includes \"banking management\" and correctly lists all elements. However, it uses \"supervisory guidelines\" instead of \"supervisory guidance,\" which is a minor deviation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"made an update\" as per the dictionary. It includes all elements and uses \"counter-financing of terrorism\" correctly. However, the phrase \"made an update\" is slightly less formal than \"updated.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"supervisory guidance\" as per the dictionary.\n- Include \"bank management\" as a separate element.\n- Use \"terrorist financing\" or \"counter-financing of terrorism\" as appropriate.\n- Maintain a formal and clear structure.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n**The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has updated its supervisory guidance on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing related to bank management and virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.**\n\n# February 8\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局宣布延長「銀行業人才起動計劃」6個月。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA announced the extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Mobility Program' for six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" (correct), \"six months\" (correct), and \"Banking Sector\" (from the dictionary).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Mobility Program\" may not be the best fit for \"起動計劃\" (which implies activation or initiation, not mobility).  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"月\" is translated as \"months,\" \"人才\" as \"talent,\" and \"銀行業\" as \"Banking Sector.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Supervisory Commission announced an extension of six months for the 'banking sector talent action plan.'\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"banking sector\" and \"talent.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" is not the correct name for \"金管局\" (HKMA). \"Action plan\" is not a strong match for \"起動計劃.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"月\" is translated as \"months,\" \"人才\" as \"talent,\" and \"銀行業\" as \"banking sector.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA announced an extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Activation Program' for six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"six months.\" \"Activation Program\" is a better fit for \"起動計劃\" than \"Mobility Program\" or \"Action Plan.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Activation Program\" is slightly more formal than needed.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority announced an extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Development Programme' for six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Development Programme\" is a plausible interpretation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Monetary Authority\" is not the correct name for \"金管局\" (HKMA).  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"月\" is translated as \"months,\" \"人才\" as \"talent,\" and \"銀行業\" as \"Banking Sector.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau announced the extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Initiative' for six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** \"Talent Initiative\" is a good fit for \"起動計劃.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" is not the correct name for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"月\" is translated as \"months,\" \"人才\" as \"talent,\" and \"銀行業\" as \"Banking Sector.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"HKMA announced the extension of the 'Banking Sector Talent Initiative Program' by six months.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"six months.\" \"Talent Initiative Program\" is a reasonable interpretation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Program\" is redundant with \"Initiative.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"HKMA\" is the correct name for \"金管局.\"\n- \"Banking Sector\" is the best translation for \"銀行業.\"\n- \"Talent\" is the best translation for \"人才.\"\n- \"Initiative\" is the best fit for \"起動計劃\" (activation\/launch plan).\n- \"Six months\" is the correct translation for \"6個月.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA announced the extension of the \"Banking Sector Talent Initiative\" for six months.\n\n# February 23\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company) announced that its fully-owned Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company) has made amendments and expanded the scope of application of the mortgage insurance plan for completed residential properties.\n\n# February 23\n\n\"100% Guaranteed Personal Preferential Loan Program\" Launches Enhanced Measures (Effective April 19) and Extends Application Period Until the End of April 2023.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe HKMA, together with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" announced the extension of the \"Pre-approved Interest-only Repayment\" scheme for an additional six months until the end of October. The principal repayment period for trade finance loans can also be extended by 90 days. The scheme also simultaneously provides a one-year partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers who are willing and capable to gradually resume normal repayments.\n\nThe \"中小企融資擔保計劃\" is a specific program name, and the dictionary provides \"Protection Scheme\" as the translation for \"保計劃.\" However, \"中小企融資擔保計劃\" should be translated as \"SME Trade Finance Guarantee Scheme\" or \"Small and Medium Enterprise Trade Finance Guarantee Scheme,\" as \"中小企\" refers to \"small and medium enterprises\" and \"融資擔保\" is \"trade finance guarantee.\" None of the junior translators consistently used this full and accurate translation.\nThe term \"優化措施\" is translated in various ways, such as \"enhanced measures,\" \"optimized measures,\" and \"optimization measures.\" The most accurate and natural translation in context is \"enhanced measures\" or \"optimization measures.\" However, \"enhanced measures\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\nThe term \"生效\" is correctly translated as \"effective\" or \"came into effect.\" \"Effective April 1\" is more concise and natural than \"came into effect on April 1.\"\nThe term \"申請期\" is translated as \"application period\" in most translations, which is correct. However, \"application period\" is more naturally expressed as \"application period\" or \"application deadline.\"\nThe term \"延長至\" is translated as \"extended to\" in most translations, which is

translations, which is correct.\nThe term \"小\" is translated as \"sub-\" or \"less\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"中小企,\" it should be translated as \"small\" or \"small and medium.\"\nThe term \"中\" is translated as \"in,\" \"among,\" \"at... time,\" \"within,\" or \"during\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"中小企,\" it should be translated as \"medium.\"\nThe term \"請\" is translated as \"invite,\" \"request,\" \"apply,\" or \"please\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"申請期,\" it should be translated as \"apply.\"\nThe term \"長\" is translated as \"long,\" \"longest,\" \"long-term,\" or \"head\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"延長至,\" it should be translated as \"extend.\"\nThe term \"期\" is translated as \"tenor,\" \"period,\"

\"launching,\" \"implement,\" or \"pilot\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"推出優化措施,\" it should be translated as \"launch\" or \"introduce.\"\nThe term \"優化\" is translated as \"enhanced,\" \"enhance,\" \"enhancing,\" \"optimization,\" \"optimized,\" \"Optimisation,\" \"improvements,\" \"enhancement,\" \"optimise,\" or \"enhancements\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"優化措施,\" it should be translated as \"enhanced\" or \"optimization.\"\nThe term \"措施\" is translated as \"measures,\" \"initiatives,\" \"controls,\" \"actions,\" or \"mitigating strategies\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"優化措施,\" it should be translated as \"measures\" or \"initiatives.\"\nThe term \"生效\" is translated as \"came into effect\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"生效,\" it should be translated as \"effective\" or \"came into effect.\"\nThe term \"申請期\" is translated as \"application period\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"申請期,\" it should be translated as \"application period\" or \"application deadline.\"\nThe term \"延長至\" is translated as \"extend to\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"延長至,\" it should be translated as \"extend to\" or \"extend until.\"\nThe term \"2023年6月30日\" is translated as \"June 30, 2023\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"2023年6月30日,\" it should be translated as \"June 30, 2023.\"\nThe term \"亦\" is translated as \"also\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"亦,\" it should be translated as \"also\" or \"too.\"\nThe term \"「\" is translated as \"[not translated, see sentences],\" '\"', or

\"July,\" \"November,\" \"June,\" \"August,\" or \"(month, as in dates)\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"月,\" it should be translated as \"month\" or \"Month.\"\nThe term \"年\" is translated as \"year,\" \"2022,\" \"2023,\" \"2009,\" \"years,\" or \"annual\" in the dictionary, but in the context of \"年,\" it should be translated as \"year\" or \"year.\"\nThe term \"2023\" is

taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (金管局) and the Insurance Authority (保險業監管局, or 保監局) to enhance customer protection in the context of using premium financing to purchase life insurance policies. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent, using \"launched measures to strengthen customer protection regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\" It correctly uses \"launched\" for 措施 and \"customer protection\" for 保障. However, it omits the full name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which may be important for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version includes \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"enhance customer protection,\" which is slightly more formal than \"strengthen.\" It is accurate and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, but uses \"for purchasing\" instead of \"to purchase.\" Both are acceptable, but \"to purchase\" is slightly more direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"are launching\" instead of \"have launched,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less definitive. Also uses \"premium finance\" instead of \"premium financing,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Introduces \"trade finance investments in life insurance policies,\" which misinterprets 融資 as \"trade finance\" and adds \"investments\" that are not in the original text. This is a significant deviation and incorrect.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"utilizing\" for 利用 and \"enhance customer protection by utilizing premium financing for the purchase of life insurance policies.\" It is accurate but slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Include the full name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for clarity.\n- Use \"launched\" for 措施, as it is the most direct and commonly used term.\n- Use \"customer protection\" for 保障, as it is the most accurate and consistent with the dictionary.\n- Use \"premium financing\" for 融資, as it is the correct term in the context of insurance.\n- Use \"to purchase\" for 投購, which is more direct than \"for purchasing.\"\n- Avoid unnecessary additions like \"investments\" or misinterpretations like \"trade finance.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Insurance Authority (IA) have launched measures to strengthen customer protection regarding the use of premium financing to purchase life insurance policies.\n\n# April 14\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding the issuance of guidance to banks concerning the reactivation of mainland bank accounts for Hong Kong residents under quarantine restrictions due to the pandemic. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"guidelines\" and \"quarantine restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" which is precise. However, \"restarting\" is slightly less formal than \"reactivating\" or \"launching.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version uses \"facilitate\" and \"relaunching,\" which are slightly more formal and precise. \"Mainland bank accounts\" is correctly used, and \"implemented due to COVID-19\" is accurate. However, \"relaunching\" is less commonly used in this context than \"reactivating.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"restart\" and \"quarantine restrictions implemented due to the pandemic,\" which is accurate. However, \"the pandemic\" is less specific than \"the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very strong. It uses \"reactivating\" and \"Mainland bank accounts,\" which are precise. \"Quarantine restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic\" is accurate and specific. The structure is clear and formal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is also strong. It uses \"reactivating\" and \"within the quarantine restrictions,\" which is slightly different in preposition but still correct. However, \"within\" is less commonly used in this context than \"under.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version is very similar to the fourth, using \"reactivating\" and \"Mainland bank accounts.\" It uses \"the pandemic\" instead of \"the COVID-19 pandemic,\" which is less specific.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, precise, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. \"Guidance\" is preferred over \"guidelines\" in this context, as it is more commonly used by regulatory bodies. \"Reactivate\" is more precise than \"restart\" or \"relaunch\" when referring to bank accounts. \"Mainland bank accounts\" is the correct term from the dictionary. \"Quarantine restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic\" is the most specific and accurate phrase.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidance to Hong Kong banks to assist Hong Kong residents in reactivating their Mainland bank accounts under the quarantine restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# April 26\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching a platform to encourage the local compliance technology (RegTech) ecosystem to enhance knowledge and experience sharing in applying compliance technology. The dictionary provides multiple acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have used various combinations of these.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"Compliance Technology Information Platform\" and \"exchange of experience and expertise.\" It correctly uses \"the Hong Kong compliance technology ecosystem.\" However, \"the\" before \"exchange\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech\" consistently, which is appropriate. However, \"specialized knowledge\" is less natural than \"expertise\" in this context. Also, \"Regtech ecosystem\" is acceptable, but \"RegTech\" should be capitalized consistently.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Regulatory Compliance Technology Information Platform,\" which is overly wordy. \"RegTech\" is more concise and commonly used. Also, \"enhance the exchange\" is slightly awkward compared to \"strengthen the exchange.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Regtech information Platform\" with inconsistent capitalization. \"Share experience and expertise\" is good, but \"compliance tech ecosystem\" is less formal than \"compliance technology ecosystem.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"launching\" instead of \"launched,\" which is less precise. Also, \"Regtech information Platform\" has inconsistent capitalization.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"Regulatory Technology Information Platform,\" which is more formal and precise. \"Enhance the exchange of experience and expertise in the application of regulatory technology\" is well-structured and accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as a standard abbreviation.\n- Use \"RegTech\" consistently and correctly capitalized.\n- Use \"experience\" and \"expertise\" as appropriate.\n- Use \"exchange\" as the most natural verb in this context.\n- Ensure proper capitalization and grammar.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has launched the \"RegTech Information Platform\" to encourage the Hong Kong RegTech ecosystem to strengthen the exchange of experience and expertise in applying RegTech.\n\n# April 28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the joint launch of the \"Banking Sector Graduate Training Program\" to expand the talent pool in the rapidly growing areas of the banking industry.\n\n# May 5th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) authorization of a \"Mandatory Background Check Program\" to be implemented by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association and the Association of Deposit-taking Companies, with the aim of addressing the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon in the banking sector.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Mandatory Background Check Program\" and \"rolling bad apples.\" However, \"Bankers' Association\" is repeated unnecessarily, and \"the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Bankers' Association)\" is redundant.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly translates \"Deposit-taking Companies Association.\" However, \"rolling bad apple\" is singular, which may not match the original's plural \"bad apples.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** This translation is accurate and concise. It uses \"authorised\" and \"banking sector\" appropriately. However, \"Hong Kong's banking sector\" is slightly less formal than \"the banking sector in Hong Kong.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Reference Checking Scheme\" instead of \"Background Check Program,\" which may not align with the dictionary's \"查核\" (audit or reference checking). Also, \"rotten apple rolling\" is an awkward phrasing compared to \"rolling bad apples.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This translation uses \"reference checking plan\" and \"Acceptance Deposit Company Association,\" which are acceptable. However, \"banking sector in Hong Kong\" is slightly less natural than \"the banking sector in Hong Kong.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and concise, using \"Mandatory Background Checking Scheme\" and \"phenomenon of 'rolling bad apples.'\" It also uses \"HKAB\" as an abbreviation, which may not be necessary unless it's a well-known acronym.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Mandatory Background Check Program\" or \"Mandatory Background Checking Scheme\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"the Hong Kong Banking Association\" or \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" as appropriate.\n- Use \"Deposit-taking Companies Association\" or \"Association of Acceptance Deposit Companies.\"\n- Use \"the banking sector in Hong Kong\" or \"Hong Kong's banking sector.\"\n- Use \"rolling bad apples\" as the phenomenon, in plural form.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has authorized the implementation of the \"Mandatory Background Check Program\" by the Hong Kong Banking Association (Banking Association) and the Deposit-taking Companies Association, with the aim of addressing the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon in the banking sector in Hong Kong.\n\n# May 6th\n\nThe \"100% Guaranteed Personal Preferential Loan Scheme\" will begin accepting applications from individual property owners affected by the temporary rent arrears relief arrangement, until October 31.\n\n# May 25th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the report titled \"Special Assessment on the Reward System for Frontline Departments in the Retail Banking Sector\" (English version), with a view to promoting a sound culture in the banking sector.\n\n# May 27th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing new sections of regulatory documents to enhance oversight of trust business operations. The translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the issuing authority and use \"trust business\" as required.\n- Most translations use \"Code of Practice\" and \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" as per the dictionary, which is appropriate.\n- The phrase \"to further strengthen\" is consistently used, aligning with the dictionary's \"以加強.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The term \"發出\" is translated as \"issued\" in all translations, which is correct, but \"issued\" may be more naturally paired with \"a new section\" rather than \"new units\" or \"new chapter.\"\n- \"相關\" is translated as \"related\" or \"relevant,\" which is acceptable, but \"related\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- \"監管\" is translated as \"supervision,\" \"regulation,\" or \"supervision and regulation.\" While all are acceptable, \"regulation and supervision\" is more natural in English.\n- \"業務\" is translated as \"business,\" which is correct, but \"trust business\" is more precise than \"trust business in Hong Kong\" or \"trust business operations.\"\n- Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" Consistency is important, and \"HKMA\" is more concise and commonly used in regulatory texts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for brevity and clarity.\n- Use \"issued\" with \"a new section\" to maintain grammatical accuracy.\n- Use \"regulation and supervision\" to reflect the dual focus of the original text.\n- Ensure \"trust business\" is used without unnecessary prepositions or modifiers.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA issued a new section of the Code of Practice for Trust Business Operations and the related Regulatory Policy Manual to further strengthen the regulation and supervision of trust business in Hong Kong.\n\n# May 31\n\nThe Hong Kong Annuity Limited, fully owned by the Mortgage Securities Company, announced the launch of optimized measures and promotional offers for the Hong Kong Annuity Plan.

The goal is to support the industry in applying financial technology.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" which is appropriate, and \"further support the industry's application of fintech\" is natural. However, \"HKMA\" should be spelled out as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"adopting fintech\" which is a natural phrasing. The use of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is correct. However, \"work plans\" should be \"work plan\" to match the singular in the original.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the second, with the same strengths. It uses \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is acceptable but less concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation has several issues. \"Release\" should be \"released\" to match the past tense. \"In light of further support\" is a misinterpretation of the original structure. The phrase \"in light of\" is not appropriate here. Also, \"technology\" is too vague; \"fintech\" is more precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is mostly accurate. However, \"in light of further supporting\" is a misinterpretation of the original structure. The phrase \"in light of\" is not appropriate here. Also, \"relevant\" is used instead of \"related,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Financial Authority\" which is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" Also, \"work plans\" should be \"work plan\" to match the singular in the original.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n- Use \"fintech\" as it is more concise and commonly used in this context.\n- Use \"work plan\" in singular to match the original.\n- Avoid misinterpretations like \"in light of\" which changes the meaning.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority released the results of the fintech application assessment and the related work plan to further support the industry's application of fintech.\n\n# July 1\n\nThe original sentence is a formal legal\/regulatory statement, and the translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"formulated to implement\" and \"came into effect.\" The structure is clear and natural. However, \"Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules\" should be \"Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022\" to match the original.\n2. **Second junior translator**: The translation is mostly correct, but the placement of \"2022\" is awkward as \"Banking Sector (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022\" should be \"2022 Banking Sector (Capital) (Amendment) Rules\" for clarity. Also, \"of Banks in Funds\" is slightly less natural than \"by Banks in Funds.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation misinterprets the structure of the original sentence. It incorrectly places \"rules on banks’ equity investments in funds’ capital requirements\" as the subject, which changes the meaning. The phrase \"came into effect\" is correct, but the sentence structure is confusing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is close but has a few issues. \"2022年\" is not translated correctly; it should be \"2022.\" Also, \"amendments to\" is awkward in this context. The phrase \"came into effect\" is correct, but the structure is slightly off.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is very similar to the first translation and is accurate. It uses \"Banking Industry\" instead of \"Banking Sector,\" which is acceptable but less precise. The structure is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the least accurate. It misplaces the subject and verb, making the sentence confusing. The phrase \"issued by the Basel Committee\" is incorrect; the Basel Committee did not \"issue\" the capital requirements, but rather the rules are based on them.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The sentence should begin with the rules and their purpose, as in the first and fifth translations.\n- \"Banking Sector\" is more precise than \"Banking Industry\" in this context.\n- \"2022\" should be placed before the rule name for clarity.\n- \"Formulated to implement\" is more natural than \"came into effect to implement.\"\n- The phrase \"Capital Requirements for Equity Investments by Banks in Funds\" is the most accurate and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe 2022 Banking Sector (Capital) (Amendment) Rules, formulated to implement the Basel Committee's \"Capital Requirements for Equity Investments by Banks in Funds,\" have come into effect.\n\n# July 6 to 8\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority participated in the design and execution of a three-day regional crisis simulation exercise.

The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and specificity.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"introduced\" and \"regarding,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than \"launched.\" The term \"consumer protection measures\" is accurate, and \"responsible lending\" is correctly used.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"launching\" and \"foster,\" which are appropriate. However, \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, \"banking sector’s\" is slightly less precise than \"banks’\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"launched\" and \"promote,\" which are accurate. The structure is clear and concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Identical to the third, with no notable issues.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"introduced\" and \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" with capitalization, which is acceptable but not necessary unless it's a trademark. Otherwise, lowercase is more standard in such contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of the \"HKMA.\" Also, \"regarding\" is slightly less direct than \"for\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"HKMA\" should be used consistently, as it is the official name of the authority.\n- \"Launched\" is more direct and commonly used in regulatory contexts than \"introduced.\"\n- \"Foster\" is a strong and appropriate verb in this context, but \"promote\" is also acceptable.\n- \"Banks’\" is more precise than \"banking sector’s\" in this context.\n- \"Buy now, pay later\" should be in lowercase unless it is a registered trademark.\n- \"Consumer protection measures\" is the most accurate and commonly used term in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has launched a series of consumer protection measures for banks' \"buy now, pay later\" products to promote responsible lending.\n\n# September 8\n\nThe HKMA announced the launch of a one-stop online resource platform \"Banking Sector Navigation\" and the second edition of the \"Banking Sector Bridging Programme\".\n\n# September 16\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the \"Coordination Mechanism for SME Loans in the Banking Sector,\" announced the extension of the \"Pre-approved Interest-only Repayment\" scheme for three months until the end of January 2023.\n\nOn the same day, the insurance company announced that the interest-only repayment arrangement under the \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has also been extended accordingly, allowing borrowing enterprises to apply for a deferral of principal repayment for a total of up to 36 months.\n\n# September 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has finalized the implementation details of the \"Pilot Program for Fintech Professional Training Subsidies\" and officially launched the program in the banking sector.\n\n# September 27\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the results of their second annual joint investigation into licensed corporations and registered institutions selling non-exchange traded investment products.

the original refers to \"能力標準,\" which should be \"capability standards.\" Also, \"has transparency\" is grammatically incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"compliance professionals\" for \"合規工作從業員,\" \"capability standards\" for \"能力標準,\" and \"transparent\" for \"具透明度.\" It should also use \"develop\" or \"formulate\" for \"制定,\" and \"collaborating with the banking industry\" for \"與銀行業界合作.\" The term \"unit\" is more appropriate than \"module\" in this context, and \"enhance the professional capabilities\" is the most natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a \"compliance\" unit under the \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework,\" collaborating with the banking industry to develop a set of capability standards that can be jointly adopted by the industry and are transparent, in order to enhance the professional capabilities of compliance professionals.\n\n# October 6\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, banks, and the stored value payment tools industry, supports the Hong Kong Police Force in launching the scam trap search tool \"Anti-Fraud Vision Detector\" to further strengthen the prevention, detection, and disruption of fraudulent activities in society and reduce the public's financial losses.\n\nIn addition to issuing practical guidance and updating the relevant \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has collaborated with the banking sector and the stored value payment tools industry to enhance public awareness of fraud prevention through consumer education information on websites and social media, and has published articles in \"Exchange\" that elaborate on these efforts.\n\n# October 20th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"Coordination Mechanism for Banking Sector SME Loans,\" announced the extension of the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme for six months until the end of July 2023, and optimized some principal repayment options to assist capable enterprises in gradually resuming normal repayments in the future.\n\nThe insurance company also announced that the application period for the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme\" arrangement of repaying interest but not principal has been extended by six months to the end of June 2023, while the cap has been extended by six months to a maximum of 42 months in total.\n\n# October 21st\n\nThe Monetary Authority issued two notices to update the relevant requirements for the sales and distribution of loss-making products, and to provide guidance on suitability assessments.\n\n# November 24\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with Digital Harbour and with the assistance of Deloitte, to hold the third \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory (AMLab 3).\" AMLab 3 is built upon the achievements of previous AMLab series, utilizing network analysis to address fraud risks and reduce losses caused by puppet account network scams.\n\n# November 28th\n\nUnder the strong support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the \"Credit Data Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Data Service Institutions\" model has commenced operations, aiming to enhance the service level of Hong Kong's personal credit data service providers and reduce the operational risks arising from the current situation where there is only one commercial operator in the market.\n\n# December 7th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice to banks regarding the \"Draft Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance 2022,\" which will come into effect in June 2023, clarifying the latest amendments related to the banking sector.\n\n# December 15th\n\nThe original text discusses a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) for the banking and stored value payment tools industry, focusing on anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism. The content includes updates on regulatory requirements, AML and compliance technologies, wealth source regulations, feedback on suspicious transaction reports, and updates on risks related to financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is clear and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"stored value payment tools industry\" and \"weapons of mass destruction.\" However, \"financing of terrorism\" is not the exact match for the term \"恐怖分子資金籌集\" (financing of terrorist activities), which should be \"counter-financing of terrorism\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This translation uses \"Regtech oversight\" and \"Sources of wealth,\" which are not ideal. \"Sources of wealth\" should be \"sources of wealth\" without capitalization. Also, \"counter-financing of terrorism related to weapons of mass destruction\" is slightly off in phrasing.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"combating money laundering and terrorist financing (AML)\" which aligns with the dictionary. However, \"mass destruction weapons\" is not the best match for \"大規模毀滅武器\" (weapons of mass destruction).\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"organized seminars\" and \"updates on regulatory requirements,\" which are appropriate. However, \"seminars\" may not be the best match for \"講座\" (seminar, lecture, etc.), and \"counter-financing of terrorism\" is used correctly.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism\" and \"financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\" which are precise matches. It also uses \"updates on regulatory requirements\" and \"regulatory requirements for wealth sources,\" which are appropriate.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This translation uses \"stored value payment facilities industry\" instead of \"stored value payment tools industry,\" which is not the best match. Also, \"anti-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction funding\" is not the best phrasing for the original term.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organised a seminar on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism for the banking and stored value payment tools industry, covering updates on regulatory requirements, anti-money laundering regulatory technology and compliance technology, regulatory requirements for sources of wealth, feedback on suspicious transaction reports, and updates on the risks of financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n# December 23\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority jointly issued a circular outlining the key results of the first joint undercover customer inspection exercise conducted by the three regulatory bodies regarding the practices of intermediaries in the sales of two tax-deductible products (namely, eligible deferred annuity policies and tax-deductible voluntary contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund), as well as the best practices observed during the inspection.\n\n# December 31\n\nAll Hong Kong's systemically important banks have established a new layer of financial resources to absorb losses during resolution, marking a milestone in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's efforts to enhance the resolvability of such banks and strengthen the resilience of the banking system.\n\n# Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre Status\n\n# January 12\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a discussion paper on cryptoassets and stablecoins, which outlines its conceptual framework for the regulation of cryptoassets, particularly stablecoins used for payment purposes, and invites views from the industry and the public on the relevant regulatory model.\n\n# January 27th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Swiss Federal Secretariat for International Financial Affairs, under the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, co-hosted the fifth Hong Kong and Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue online.\n\n# February\n\nThe original text discusses the reappointment of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as co-chair of a working group under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), with a two-year term, and notes that the FATF is a global organization responsible for setting anti-money laundering standards.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"reappointed\" and \"co-Chairman\" appropriately. However, \"Financial Action Special Group\" is not the correct name of the organization; it should be \"Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\" Also, \"developing\" is slightly less precise than \"formulating\" or \"setting.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural, using \"co-chair\" and \"period of two years.\" It correctly identifies the FATF as the organization and uses \"develops global standards for anti-money laundering.\" However, \"Financial Action Task Force\" is not capitalized consistently.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version, using \"co-chair,\" \"Assessment and Compliance Steering Group,\" and \"global standards formulation organisation.\" However, \"HKMA\" should be spelled out as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural, using \"co-chair\" and \"two-year term.\" It correctly uses \"Financial Action Special Organisation,\" though \"Special Organisation\" is not the standard term for FATF. Also, \"standards-formulating organisation\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is problematic because it incorrectly states that the FATF \"obtained the appointment as co-chair of the Assessment and Compliance Group under the Financial Action Task Force,\" which is a logical contradiction. The FATF cannot be both the appointing body and the appointee.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Intelligence Unit\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"standard-setting organization,\" which is accurate but slightly less precise than \"formulating\" or \"developing.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as the subject.\n- Use the correct name for the organization: \"Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\"\n- Use \"reappointed\" or \"again appointed\" for \"再次獲任命.\"\n- Use \"co-chair\" or \"co-Chairman\" for \"聯席主席.\"\n- Use \"two-year term\" or \"for a period of two years\" for \"任期兩年.\"\n- Use \"formulate\" or \"develop\" for \"制定.\"\n- Use \"global standards-formulating organization\" or \"global organization responsible for formulating anti-money laundering standards.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has again been appointed as co-chair of the Assessment and Compliance Working Group under the Financial Action Task Force, for a two-year term.

Also, \"Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Tightening\" is slightly awkward compared to \"Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact terms from the dictionary.\n- Accurately represent the number of participants as \"840,000.\"\n- Use the full name \"Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)\" and \"Academy of Finance (AoF).\"\n- Use a formal and grammatically correct title for the seminar.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) and the Academy of Finance (AoF) co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Latest Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore Renminbi Market,\" which attracted 840,000 participants online.\n\n# April 27\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issuing a discussion paper on the policy and design aspects of introducing a retail-level central bank digital currency, known as the \"digital Hong Kong dollar\" or e-HKD, and seeking public opinion.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"e-HKD\" appropriately. The title is well translated, and the structure is clear. However, \"the key policy and design issues involved in introducing\" is slightly wordy.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is also accurate, with \"elaborating on\" being a good choice for \"闡述.\" However, \"retail-level central bank digital currency\" is slightly awkward compared to \"retail-level central bank digital currency (i.e., 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar' or e-HKD).\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The use of \"policies and design items\" is less precise than \"policy and design issues.\" Also, \"introducing retail central bank digital currency\" lacks the clarity of \"introducing a retail-level central bank digital currency.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"considerations\" effectively for \"事項\" and \"seeking views\" is a natural phrasing.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** Similar to the fourth, but \"main policy and design aspects\" is slightly less precise than \"key policy and design considerations.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** The title is awkwardly formatted with the Chinese brackets. Also, \"to Hong Kong\" is incorrect; it should be \"in Hong Kong.\" The use of \"invites comments\" is slightly less natural than \"seeks views.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Accurately reflect the title of the document.\n- Use \"key policy and design considerations\" for \"主要政策及設計事項.\"\n- Use \"retail-level central bank digital currency\" for \"零售層面央行數碼貨幣.\"\n- Use \"seeks views\" for \"徵求意見.\"\n- Ensure the structure is clear and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issues a discussion paper titled \"From a Policy and Design Perspective on 'Digital Hong Kong Dollar',\" outlining the key policy and design considerations involved in introducing a retail-level central bank digital currency (i.e., \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD) in Hong Kong, and seeks views.\n\n# May 3rd\n\nThe original sentence is a complex structure that requires careful attention to the relationships between the entities involved and the precise use of terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of the junior translators' work:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but the phrase \"initiated jointly by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, and Standard Chartered Bank\" is misleading. The sentence structure implies that Standard Chartered Bank was also a co-initiator, which is not the case. The \"and\" at the end incorrectly includes Standard Chartered Bank as a co-initiator.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is clear and grammatically correct. It correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation as the initiators and Standard Chartered Bank as the co-host. The use of \"co-hosted\" is appropriate for \"合辦.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the second one, but it uses \"co-hosted\" correctly and includes the quotation marks around the event name. However, it uses \"Capital Market\" instead of \"Capital Markets,\" which is less precise given the dictionary options.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of content but is somewhat wordy and repetitive with the use of \"jointly\" twice. It also uses \"launched\" for \"發起,\" which is not the best fit in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is concise but has a grammatical issue with the phrase \"World Bank Group members International Finance Corporation,\" which should be \"a member of the World Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation.\" It also omits the \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance\" as the subject of the sentence.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" instead of \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance,\" which is a key term from the original text. It also uses \"Sustainability\" instead of \"Sustainable,\" which is less appropriate in this context.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The correct structure should identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation as the initiators of the \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance.\"\n- The event should be described as being \"co-hosted\" by the \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance\" and Standard Chartered Bank.\n- The event name should be enclosed in quotation marks and use \"Capital Markets\" as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"online\" should be placed correctly to indicate the format of the meeting.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance,\" jointly initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, co-hosted the \"Green and Sustainable Capital Markets Transformation Roundtable Meeting\" online with Standard Chartered Bank.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

2023 Work Priorities and Outlook\n\nDespite the signs of economic recovery in Hong Kong in early 2023, the external environment remains full of challenges and uncertainties. Recent stress in the banking sectors of the US and Europe, with individual US banks collapsing in March 2023, has caused ripple effects across global financial markets. Meanwhile, major central banks tightening monetary policies could likely lead to a slowdown or even a decline in global economic growth in 2023. On the other hand, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the persistent threat of deglobalization may continue to hinder global trade and cause periodic volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, supported by its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places significant emphasis on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of uncertain macroeconomic environments, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a key international financial centre. Facing a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage its foreign exchange fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and maintaining high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system maintains stability and soundness.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system; this is a prerequisite for the continued provision of key financial services and is therefore vital to the normal operation of Hong Kong's economy.\n\n# Stay alert to potential risks\n\nIn 2023, the uncertainty surrounding the future path of US interest rates, along with pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in global financial markets from time to time. However, Hong Kong's financial system, bolstered by its resilience and buffers built up over the years, is well-positioned to weather adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but has a grammatical error in the last sentence: “assessment potential risks” should be “assess potential risks.” Also, “outside environment” is less common than “overseas” or “external.”\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses “overseas environments” and “research items,” which are acceptable. However, “research items” is slightly awkward compared to “study matters.”\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is well-structured and uses “HKMA” (a common abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority), which is appropriate. It uses “external environments” and “assess the potential risks associated with these matters,” which are natural and precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the third, with the only difference being the use of “overseas environment” instead of “external environments.” It is also grammatically sound and fluent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is a strong translation, using “external environments” and “assess the potential risks associated with these matters.” It is concise and natural, with no grammatical errors.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is also strong, using “issues” instead of “matters” and “evaluate” instead of “assess.” While “evaluate” is a valid synonym for “assess,” it may slightly alter the nuance of the original text, which uses “評估” more in the sense of “assess” rather than “evaluate.”\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term “香港” should be translated as “Hong Kong” or “Hong Kong’s” depending on context. In this case, “Hong Kong’s” is more appropriate when referring to its systems or economy.\n- “穩定” should be translated as “stability” or “maintaining... stability” depending on context. Here, “stability” is more natural.\n- “評估” should be translated as “assess” or “assessments,” and “assess” is more active and appropriate in this context.\n- “體系” should be translated as “systems” or “system,” and “systems” is more appropriate when referring to “貨幣及金融體系.”\n- “風險” should be translated as “risks.”\n- “環境” should be translated as “environments” or “environment,” and “environments” is more natural in this context.\n- “研究” should be translated as “study” or “research,” and “study” is more natural in this context.\n- “影響” should be translated as “affect” or “impact,” and “affect” is more natural in this context.\n- “相關” should be translated as “related” or “associated,” and “associated” is more natural in this context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the risks and vulnerabilities in the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also study matters that affect Hong Kong’s economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintaining the Stability of the Banking System\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, the following review and reasoning have been conducted:\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"weathered\" for \"抵禦\" and \"best practices\" for \"做法.\" However, it uses \"operating environment\" consistently, which is appropriate. The structure is clear and natural.\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"weather shocks\" and \"best practices\" correctly. It also uses \"strives to\" for \"致力,\" which is appropriate. However, \"enhance its banking supervision framework\" is slightly awkward compared to \"banking regulatory framework.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"withstand shocks\" for \"抵禦,\" which is a good choice. It also uses \"remains well-positioned to\" for \"具足夠,\" which is a strong expression. However, \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is used instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less concise.\n4. **Translation 4** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"withstand shocks\" and \"best practices\" correctly. It also uses \"ever-changing\" for \"瞬息萬變,\" which is a good choice. However, \"carry out ongoing regulatory work\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses \"weather shocks\" and \"best practices\" correctly. It also uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently. However, \"enhancing the banking regulatory framework\" is slightly less precise than \"strengthening and optimizing.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is fluent and accurate, using \"withstand shocks\" and \"best practices\" correctly. However, \"enhancing continuous regulatory efforts\" is slightly awkward and less natural than \"through ongoing regulatory efforts.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text while ensuring clarity and fluency in English. Based on the above, the best elements from each translation can be combined to produce a polished version.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn light of the escalation of geopolitical tensions and major central banks' aggressive interest rate hikes to keep inflation in check, the operating environment for the banking sector in 2023 is expected to remain challenging. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both risks and opportunities for the banking sector. Facing an ever-changing financial environment, the HKMA strives to ensure banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks through ongoing regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also refer to international standards and best practices to continue strengthening and optimizing the banking regulatory framework and policies.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorised institutions, focusing on the loan classification and provisioning practices of authorised institutions, as well as the management of borrowers with poorer financial conditions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also strengthen its monitoring system and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to keep itself informed of the operating environment of enterprises, and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, in preparation for the eventual withdrawal from the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme, while at the same time ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties still receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn addition, facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also strengthen the supervision of authorised institutions' liquidity and market risk management in 2023.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in terms of grammar, capitalization, and consistency. The first, third, and fifth translations are the most consistent and grammatically correct, using \"Operations\" with a capital \"O\" and \"Risks\" with a capital \"R,\" which is appropriate for a title. The second, fourth, and sixth translations use lowercase \"operation\" and \"risks,\" which is less suitable for a title.\nThe term \"業務\" is correctly translated as \"Business\" in all translations, which is appropriate. \"科技\" is translated as \"Technology\" or \"Technology\" in all translations, which is acceptable, though \"Tech\" or \"technological\" could also be used depending on context. However, in this case, \"Technology\" is the most natural and widely understood term.\n\"操作\" is translated as \"Operation\" or \"Operations\" in most translations, which is correct. \"風險\" is translated as \"Risks\" or \"Risk,\" which is also correct, though \"Risks\" is more appropriate in the context of a title.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Business Operations and Technology Risks,\" as it is grammatically correct, consistent in capitalization, and uses the most natural and widely understood terms.\n\nAs banks increasingly apply technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strive to enhance the operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the Regulatory Policy Manual in May, the HKMA will maintain close contact with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in developing operational resilience frameworks. Meanwhile, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cyber defense capabilities by following up on issues identified under the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework 2.0\" and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup measures.\n\nAs the pace of digitalisation quickens, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's other regulatory priorities include strengthening the supervision of risk management for third-party service providers in banks, as well as enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms provided. However, there are a few observations to consider:\n1. **Capitalization and Punctuation**: The first, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Anti-Money Laundering\" with a capital \"M\" in \"Money,\" which is acceptable in formal titles but may be inconsistent with the lowercase \"money\" used in the dictionary. The second, third, and sixth translations use lowercase \"money,\" which is more standard in general English usage unless it is part of a proper noun or title.\n2. **Punctuation**: The fourth translation includes a \"#\" symbol at the beginning, which matches the original Chinese text but may not be necessary in the English translation unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement.\n3. **Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"counter-financing of terrorism\" as per the dictionary, which is the most precise and contextually appropriate term provided.\n4. **Fluency and Naturalness**: All translations are fluent and natural in English, with no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.\nConsidering these points, the most natural and standard translation would be \"Anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism,\" using lowercase for \"money\" as it is not a proper noun in this context. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is optional and depends on formatting preferences. Therefore, the best possible translation is:\nAnti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism.\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will focus its work on updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) ecosystem to address AML and CFT risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology and compliance technology. The HKMA’s “Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism” will also be revised, with specific guidance issued on measures proportionate to the risks associated with “politically exposed persons,” thereby facilitating the industry’s implementation of key legislative amendments through effective and risk-based approaches. Meanwhile, the HKMA will expand the scope of its existing public-private partnership collaborations to enhance information sharing and support the launch of an information-sharing platform among banks, aiming to accelerate the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account misuse, and strengthen protection for victims of scams while assisting them in recovering their losses. The HKMA will also further focus on promoting the adoption of compliance technology (including data analytics) through the “Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory” and other AML compliance technology initiatives, striving to develop macro-level analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. By implementing these measures, the HKMA will be able to respond more swiftly to systemic money laundering risks such as puppet account networks and flexibly address evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Business\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" as per the dictionary, and \"taking into account\" for \"參考\". However, \"securities\" is used for \"證券\", which is acceptable, but \"bonds\" might be more precise if the context refers specifically to debt instruments.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has several grammatical errors, such as \"will taking into account\" and \"market latest development\". It also uses \"bond\" for \"證券\", which may not be accurate. Additionally, \"consultation Platform\" should be \"consultation platform\" with lowercase unless it's a proper noun.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect\" and \"refer to\" for \"參考\". However, \"inspections\" may be more appropriate than \"reviews\" for \"審查\", depending on the context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" as per the dictionary. It uses \"intensify\" for \"加強\", which is appropriate. However, \"environmental, social, and governance\" should be \"environment, social, and governance\" to match the dictionary's \"environment, social, and governance (ESG)\".\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"bond\" for \"證券\", which may not be accurate. It also uses \"the community\" for \"社會\", which is not the best fit in this context. Additionally, \"scheme\" for \"計劃\" is acceptable, but \"program\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" as per the dictionary, \"take into account\" for \"參考\", and \"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\" correctly. It also uses \"enhance\" for \"加強\", which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" as it is the most commonly used term in regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"take into account\" for \"參考\" as it is the most natural phrasing.\n- Use \"securities\" for \"證券\" as it is the standard term in financial contexts.\n- Use \"environment, social, and governance (ESG)\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"strengthen\" for \"加強\" as it is the most natural and commonly used verb in this context.\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are translated using the most appropriate and contextually accurate English alternatives.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strengthen on-site reviews and off-site monitoring of authorised institutions' conduct regarding wealth management, as well as the sales of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. The focus areas for 2023 will include the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environment, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. During this process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"work closely with\" for \"緊密聯繫\" and \"formulate a comprehensive regulatory framework\" for \"制定...監管架構.\" However, \"mandatory provident fund\" is not a standard term in the dictionary, and \"HKMA\" is not explicitly mentioned in the original text.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent but uses \"strong accumulation fund\" instead of \"強積金,\" which is not a standard term. It also uses \"financial regulatory authorities\" instead of \"financial regulatory bodies,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise match.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"closely linked\" for \"緊密聯繫,\" which is not the best match. It also uses \"supervisory standards\" for \"監管標準,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise. The term \"Mandatory Provident Fund\" is used, which is correct but not in the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"maintain close contact\" for \"緊密聯繫\" and \"MPF\" for \"強積金,\" which is acceptable. It also uses \"formulate a comprehensive virtual asset regulatory framework,\" which is accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"closely coordinate\" for \"緊密聯繫,\" which is not the best match. It also uses \"strong accumulation fund\" again, which is incorrect. The term \"develop a comprehensive regulatory framework\" is slightly less precise than \"formulate.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"maintain close contact\" for \"緊密聯繫,\" \"MPF\" for \"強積金,\" and \"formulate a comprehensive regulatory framework\" for \"制定...監管架構.\" It also uses \"financial regulatory bodies\" consistently and avoids non-dictionary terms.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should use \"maintain close contact\" for \"緊密聯繫,\" \"MPF\" for \"強積金,\" and \"formulate a comprehensive regulatory framework\" for \"制定...監管架構.\" It should also avoid non-dictionary terms like \"mandatory provident fund\" and \"strong accumulation fund.\" The term \"HKMA\" should be used if it is known to be the full name of the organization, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the original text.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also maintain close contact with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, and provide guidance to authorized institutions on the regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and MPF products as needed, which will also include guidance on providing virtual asset-related investment services. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulatory bodies to formulate a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory institutions to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including those applicable to sophisticated investors), and will commence regulating the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with the new sections and new operational codes in the relevant Regulatory Policy Manual.\n\n# Monitor Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms such as \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" and \"infrastructure.\" It correctly uses \"assessing each infrastructure\" and \"international standards.\" However, it uses \"HKMA\" without defining it initially, which may be confusing for some readers.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"Financial Market Infrastructures\" and \"FMII Principles.\" However, it uses \"Financial Infrastructure Committee\" instead of \"Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee,\" which is a minor discrepancy. It also uses \"technology development\" instead of \"technological developments,\" which is slightly less precise.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance\" and \"Infrastructure Principles.\" It also uses \"engaging in the work of international standards-setting organizations,\" which is a natural phrasing. However, it uses \"stored value payment tools\" instead of \"stored value facilities,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Payment Ordinance\" and \"PFMI.\" However, it uses \"Financial Infrastructure Committee\" instead of \"Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee,\" which is a minor discrepancy. It also uses \"supervisory provisions\" instead of \"supervisory requirements,\" which is slightly less precise.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Payment Ordinance\" and \"Infrastructure Principles.\" However, it uses \"Payment and Financial Infrastructures Committee\" instead of \"Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee,\" which is a minor discrepancy. It also uses \"Securities and Futures Commission\" instead of \"International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),\" which is incorrect.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Payment Ordinance\" and \"Infrastructure Principles.\" However, it uses \"Principles of Financial Market Infrastructure\" instead of \"Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures,\" which is a minor discrepancy. It also uses \"International Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)\" instead of \"International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),\" which is incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and strictly adhere to the dictionary terms. It should also define acronyms like \"HKMA\" on first use and use the correct names for organizations like \"IOSCO.\" Based on this, the first translation is the most accurate and fluent, but it lacks the initial definition of \"HKMA.\" The third translation is also strong and uses \"stored value payment tools\" instead of \"stored value facilities,\" which is a minor deviation. The fifth translation is also strong but incorrectly refers to \"Securities and Futures Commission\" instead of \"IOSCO.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructure under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (Infrastructure Principles), and the guidance issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. Where necessary, it will refer to the latest international standards to assess various infrastructures. The HKMA will participate in the oversight and assessment programs conducted by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on the implementation of the Infrastructure Principles, and will also engage in the work of international standard-setting organizations, strengthening its own oversight requirements in accordance with international practices or adapting to market and technological developments. Meanwhile, if necessary, the HKMA will cooperate with relevant authorities to further enhance collaborative oversight arrangements.\n\n# Formulate Policies\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"Basel III,\" \"capital framework,\" \"countercyclical buffer,\" and \"Legislative Council.\"\n- The structure of the original text is generally preserved, with bullet points and dates clearly presented.\n- Most translations use fluent English and maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory documents.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** misrepresents \"出項下限規定\" as \"lower limits for exposures\" instead of \"introduce a floor for capital requirements,\" which is more precise.\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 3** are the most accurate in terms of terminology and structure, but **Translation 3** incorrectly refers to \"the Basel III agreement\" instead of \"Basel III\" as per the dictionary.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Banking Ordinance (Capital) Rules\" instead of \"Banking (Capital) Rules,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly translates \"出項下限規定\" as \"item-based limit\" and \"正值中性逆周期緩衝資本\" as \"positive neutral cyclical buffer capital,\" which are not accurate.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"positive-neutral countercyclical buffer capital,\" which is not a standard term and may confuse readers.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms where applicable.\n- Maintain the formal and precise tone of the original text.\n- Ensure clarity and accuracy in regulatory terminology.\n- Preserve the structure and bullet points of the original text.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of **Translation 2** and **Translation 3**, while correcting the inaccuracies and ensuring consistency with the dictionary.\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize the capital framework by implementing the standards issued in recent years by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), including:  \n- The revised capital standards set out in the following documents:  \n  - *Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms* published in December 2017;  \n  - *Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk* (revised in February 2019) published in January 2019;  \n  - *Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework* published in July 2020.  \n  These revised capital standards, collectively referred to as the *Basel III Final Reforms*, outline new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, introduce a floor for capital requirements, and enhance the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultations in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on proposed amendments to the *Banking (Capital) Rules* (the *Capital Rules*) in 2023 to implement these requirements and the countercyclical capital buffer. The proposed amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny in the same year and will not take effect earlier than January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.  \n- *Prudential Treatment of Cryptoasset Risk Exposure* published in December 2022. The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally on January 1, 2025, in line with the Basel Committee’s timetable, and intends to consult the industry on related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Bearing Limits\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate in most parts. It correctly uses \"Basel III agreement\" and \"revised capital standards.\" However, it uses \"Banking (Risk-taking Limits) Rules\" which may not be the exact title. Also, \"the implementation of the revised capital standards under the final reform package\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is very close to the original in structure and uses \"Banking Sector (Risk Concentration Limits) Rules,\" which may be more accurate. It also uses \"official entity concentration risks\" and \"handling methods,\" which are good. However, \"put forward in response to\" is slightly less natural than \"made in response to.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is fluent and uses \"Banking (Risk Limitation) Rules,\" which may not be the exact title. It uses \"methods for handling concentrated risks\" which is accurate. However, \"credit risk component\" is slightly less precise than \"credit risk portion.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version uses \"Banking Sector (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules,\" which may be the most accurate title. It uses \"arose from the implementation of the final reforms\" which is natural. However, \"handling of concentrated risk for official entities\" is slightly less precise than \"handling of concentrated risk of official entities.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This is one of the best translations. It uses \"Banking Sector (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules\" and \"treatment of concentration risk by official entities.\" It also uses \"not earlier than January 1, 2024,\" which is more natural than \"no earlier than.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is very close to the original in structure and uses \"Banking Sector (Risk Limit) Rules.\" However, it adds \"as implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is not in the original text. It also uses \"within official entities,\" which is slightly less precise than \"of official entities.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the most accurate title for the rules, use natural English phrasing, and adhere to the dictionary terms. Based on the review, the fifth translation is the most accurate and natural, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the \"Banking Sector (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules\" in March 2023. The proposed amendments mainly arise from the HKMA's implementation of the final Basel III reforms mentioned above, which involve the revised capital standards. The consultation paper also includes other corresponding amendments regarding the treatment of concentration risk by official entities under the \"Capital Rules.\" The implementation date of the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised \"Capital Rules\" under the final Basel III reforms (i.e., not earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"HKMA\" and \"Basel III.\" It correctly uses \"not earlier than January 1, 2024\" and adheres to the dictionary for terms like \"年\" (year) and \"日\" (day). However, it uses \"the 'Banking (Liquidity) (Amended) Rules'\" which slightly deviates from the dictionary's \"Rules\" or \"set of rules.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"Banking Sector\" instead of \"banking industry\" or \"banking sector\" as per the dictionary, which is acceptable but less precise. It also uses \"tranche\" for \"部分\" (portion), which is not ideal in this context. The term \"Basel III agreement’s final reform plan\" is awkwardly phrased.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in structure and uses \"banking sector\" correctly. It uses \"no earlier than January 1, 2024,\" which is slightly different from the dictionary's \"not earlier than,\" but still acceptable. It also uses \"final reforms of the Basel III agreement,\" which is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is one of the most fluent and accurate translations. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently, \"banking sector\" appropriately, and \"not earlier than January 1, 2024\" as per the dictionary. It also correctly uses \"revised Capital Rules under the Basel III final reforms.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the fourth, with the exception of using \"Liquidity Amendment Rules 2023\" without quotation marks, which is less formal. It also uses \"final Basel III reform package,\" which is slightly different from the dictionary's \"Basel III.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"banking sector\" and \"Basel III\" correctly. It uses \"provisions\" for \"部分\" (portion), which is acceptable but not the most precise term in this context.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"banking sector\" is more precise than \"banking industry\" in this context.\n- \"HKMA\" should be used consistently.\n- \"Not earlier than January 1, 2024\" is the most natural phrasing.\n- \"Basel III\" should be used without additional descriptors like \"agreement\" or \"reform package\" unless necessary.\n- \"Rules\" should be used consistently, avoiding \"set of rules\" unless the context requires it.\n- \"Credit risk portion\" is more natural than \"credit risk provisions\" or \"credit risk tranche.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the banking sector in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the 2023 Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules (the \"2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules\"). These amendments are made in response to concurrent proposed amendments to the Capital Rules, and therefore, the target implementation date of the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk portion of the revised Capital Rules under the Basel III final reforms (i.e., not earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key documents and their issuance dates.\n- The concept of \"window dressing\" is consistently translated, with most versions using the term \"window dressing\" in quotes.\n- The mention of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is accurately rendered.\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Banking Ordinance (Disclosure) Rules\" instead of \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules,\" which may not be accurate based on the dictionary.\n- **\"後審議程序\" (for negative vetting):** Some translations use \"pre-establishment and post-consultation process\" or \"post-establishment and pre-vetting procedure,\" which are not accurate. The correct translation is \"for negative vetting.\"\n- **\"正擬備\" (is in the process of preparing):** Some translations use \"is preparing\" or \"is currently preparing,\" which is acceptable but not as precise as \"is in the process of preparing.\"\n- **\"表格\" (tables):** Some translations use \"forms\" instead of \"tables,\" which may not be the best fit.\n- **\"徵詢業界意見\" (consulting with the industry):** Some translations use \"consulting with the industry during the process,\" which is acceptable but could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms where applicable.\n- Maintain a natural and fluent English structure.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology, especially for key terms like \"後審議程序\" and \"表格.\"\n- Use \"is in the process of preparing\" for \"正擬備.\"\n- Use \"tables\" for \"表格.\"\n- Use \"for negative vetting\" for \"後審議程序.\"\n- Use \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards in the final Basel III reform package are primarily outlined in two documents issued by the Basel Committee: the \"Third Pillar 1 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" issued in December 2018, and the \"Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements,\" issued in November 2021. The Basel Committee also issued the \"Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements\" in June 2019, addressing concerns about potential \"window dressing\" (referring to banks reducing certain transaction volumes before or after the reporting date to artificially inflate reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratios). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also in the process of preparing corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and tables, while consulting the industry throughout the process. The revised Disclosure Rules are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council together with amendments to the Capital Rules for the \"negative vetting\" process during 2023.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Institutional Governance\n\nThe original text emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) commitment to good governance in maintaining public trust in its statutory responsibilities. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"uphold high standards of institutional governance\" and correctly translating \"法定\" as \"statutory.\" However, \"the HKMA's fulfillment\" could be slightly more natural as \"the HKMA's fulfillment of.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is concise but omits \"trust\" and uses \"a high standard\" instead of \"high standards.\" Also, \"the importance in maintaining\" is slightly awkward compared to \"the importance of maintaining.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is accurate and natural, using \"recognizes\" and \"committed to upholding high institutional governance standards.\" However, \"central bank institution\" is slightly less standard than \"central banking institution.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation has a repetition of \"confidence\" and uses \"institution’s governance,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"Central\" with a capital letter inconsistently.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version is fluent and accurate, using \"trust and confidence\" and \"strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\" It also correctly uses \"the Authority\" instead of \"the HKMA\" for variation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most polished translation, using \"sound governance\" (a synonym for \"good governance\") and \"statutory duties\" (a valid alternative to \"statutory responsibilities\"). It also uses \"consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance,\" which is natural and fluent.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"statutory responsibilities\" or \"statutory duties\" (both are acceptable).\n- Use \"good governance\" or \"sound governance\" (both are acceptable).\n- Use \"uphold high standards of institutional governance\" or \"uphold high institutional governance standards.\"\n- Include both \"trust\" and \"confidence.\"\n- Use \"the HKMA\" or \"the Authority\" for variation.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as Hong Kong’s central banking institution, clearly understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding the public’s trust and confidence in the HKMA’s fulfillment of its statutory responsibilities, and therefore has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to good institutional governance, the HKMA:  \n- Has established a clear and highly accountable institutional governance framework;  \n- Implements robust and comprehensive monitoring measures to manage risks and ensures that the behavior of all staff members and their day-to-day operations comply with specified standards; and  \n- Adheres to transparent and open policies, maintaining close contact with all stakeholders.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government), but it can hire employees under employment terms different from those of civil servants, in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its employees are all public officials. The HKMA's day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the scope of statutory powers granted to or delegated by the Financial Management Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority on June 25, 2003, it was stated that the Currency Board system should be used to maintain monetary stability, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at a level of about 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"Director of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" which is not in the dictionary. The term \"Director\" is not listed for \"局長\" (Director of the Bureau), and \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" is not a direct match for \"財經事務及庫務局\".\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"soundness\" for \"健全\", which is acceptable, but \"status\" for \"地位\" is more appropriate than \"role\" or \"position\" in this context.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is concise and uses \"Treasury\" for \"庫務局\", which is acceptable. However, it uses \"facilitate\" for \"促進\", which is less precise than \"promote\" or \"enhance\". It also uses \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系\", which is acceptable but not the most precise term.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" for \"財經事務及庫務局局長\", which is not in the dictionary. It uses \"safeguard... stability\" for \"維持...穩定\", which is a bit awkward. It also uses \"being responsible for the operation\" for \"負責操作\", which is not as precise as \"overseeing the operation\".\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and uses \"Chief Executive of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" for \"財經事務及庫務局局長\", which is not in the dictionary. It uses \"Chief Executive\" which is not a match for \"局長\". It also uses \"security\" for \"安全\", which is acceptable but \"safety\" is more commonly used in this context.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. It uses \"Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury\" for \"財經事務及庫務局局長\", which is not in the dictionary. It uses \"safeguarding Hong Kong’s position\" for \"保持...地位\", which is a good choice. It also uses \"overseeing the operation\" for \"負責操作\", which is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the exact terms from the dictionary, maintain fluency, and ensure grammatical correctness. Based on the above review, the best approach is to use \"Financial Secretary\" for \"財政司司長\", \"the Treasury\" for \"庫務局\", \"status\" for \"地位\", \"stability\" and \"soundness\" for \"穩定\" and \"健全\", and \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員\". The structure should be clear and concise, using appropriate terms for \"banking system\", \"debt markets\", \"statutory banknotes and coins\", \"financial infrastructure\", and \"international competitiveness\".\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organisations to develop debt markets;\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of statutory banknotes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and, where appropriate, overseeing the operation of these systems; and\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organisations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe original text outlines the authority structure regarding the management of the Exchange Fund. It specifies that the Financial Secretary holds control, and the Monetary Authority is responsible for managing and investing the fund under delegated powers.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Financial Secretary\" as per the dictionary. However, \"must act according to the powers delegated\" is slightly less formal than the original, which uses \"須根據...轉授的權力.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"must, according to the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary, be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\" The phrasing is natural and grammatically sound.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary,\" which is slightly more formal than the original but still appropriate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is concise and natural. It uses \"acting under powers delegated by the Financial Secretary,\" which is a slightly more active phrasing than the original but still accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation introduces \"deployment and investment management,\" which is not directly present in the original. While \"investment management\" is acceptable, \"deployment\" is not a direct translation of the original term. The use of \"as authorized by the powers delegated\" is slightly more complex than necessary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version incorrectly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" as specified in the dictionary. This is a critical error, as it misrepresents the role. The rest of the translation is otherwise accurate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Monetary Authority\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Use \"Financial Secretary\" as specified.\n- Maintain the formal tone of the original.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and fluency.\nThe second and third translations are the most accurate and natural. However, the second translation is slightly more concise and better reflects the original structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority must, according to the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary, be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) autonomy in its methods for daily operations and policy implementation, while maintaining accountability and transparency. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and use appropriate terms like \"day-to-day operations\" and \"implementation of government policy objectives.\"\n- The phrase \"a high degree of autonomy\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"高度.\"\n- The use of \"while at the same time\" or \"while simultaneously\" effectively conveys the conjunction \"同時.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"operation\" instead of \"operations\" (singular vs. plural), which may not match the intended meaning of \"日常運作.\"\n- The term \"supplemented by\" in Translation 6 is less natural than \"supported by\" or \"alongside.\"\n- \"Policy objectives\" is slightly more formal than \"policy goals\" or \"policy targets,\" but all are acceptable.\n- \"High accountability and transparency\" is correct, but \"a high level of accountability and transparency\" (used in Translation 1 and 5) is more fluent and natural.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"operations\" (plural) to match \"運作.\"\n- Use \"while at the same time\" or \"while simultaneously\" for \"同時.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"government policy objectives\" or \"government policy goals.\"\n- Use \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for full formality, or \"HKMA\" for brevity, depending on context.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has always maintained a high degree of autonomy in the methods adopted for day-to-day operations and the implementation of government policy objectives, while at the same time ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority strives to promote the stability of the monetary and banking system, effectively manage official reserves, develop and monitor robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which emphasizes the importance of public trust for the HKMA and its efforts to communicate policies and address misinformation. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"HKMA\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) and incorporate the dictionary term \"responsibilities\" or \"duties.\"\n- The phrase \"makes every effort\" is consistently used for \"盡力,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"timely\" is appropriately used for \"適時.\"\n- The use of \"false information and rumors\" for \"失實資訊及謠言\" is accurate and natural.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"must makes every effort\" (incorrect grammar) and includes \"dissemination of inaccurate information,\" which is not the intended meaning of \"澄清\" (clarify).\n- **Translation 3** uses \"rigorous approach\" for \"嚴謹,\" which is acceptable but \"stringent\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA\" and omits the \"Hong Kong\" part, which may be less specific.\n- **Translation 5** and **6** are the most accurate, with only minor issues such as \"fall within the HKMA's scope of responsibilities\" (which is slightly wordy) and \"issues\" instead of \"matters.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"HKMA\" throughout the translation.\n- Use \"stringent\" for \"嚴謹\" to reflect the formal and strict nature of the HKMA's approach.\n- Use \"matters\" for \"項\" as it is more natural in this context.\n- Ensure that \"澄清\" is translated as \"clarify\" rather than \"dissemination\" or \"provide information.\"\n- Maintain a clear and concise structure, avoiding redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA must gain the trust of the public to effectively fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a stringent attitude in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and makes every effort to handle matters that are of public concern and fall within the scope of the HKMA's responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA timely clarifies false information and rumors regarding its policies through traditional and social media.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: Generally accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Financial Secretary.\" However, \"the HKMA is responsible to the public through the Financial Secretary\" is slightly awkward. Also, \"taking into account statutory limitations on market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and disclosure of confidential information\" is a bit wordy.\n2. **Second Translation**: Very fluent and accurate. It uses \"accountable\" consistently, which is more appropriate than \"responsible\" in this context. The structure is clear and the use of \"namely\" is effective. However, \"remains committed to making every effort\" is slightly redundant.\n3. **Third Translation**: Contains some errors, such as \"The Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary\" (should be \"The Monetary Authority Commissioner\"). Also, \"more extensive responsibility\" is less precise than \"broader responsibilities.\" The phrase \"subject to the statutory limitations of considerations of market sensitivity\" is awkward.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: Very strong. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. The phrase \"striving to enhance transparency and maintain an open approach\" is natural. The structure is clear and the use of \"attuned to societal trends\" is effective.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: Very similar to the fourth, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"financial community\" instead of \"financial sector,\" which is acceptable. The phrase \"provides appropriate responses to public opinion\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: Contains several errors, including \"the Monetary Authority’s FS\" (FS is not appropriate here). Also, \"the Legislative\" is incomplete and should be \"the Legislative Council.\" The phrase \"help enhance public understanding\" is less direct than \"promote public understanding.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the correct terminology. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above review, the fourth translation is the strongest, with minor adjustments to enhance clarity and precision.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary and is therefore accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Additionally, since the HKMA's authority is established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring matters of concern to the community. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain an open approach. This policy has two main objectives: \n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public have a full understanding of the HKMA's work, taking into account statutory restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information, commercial secrets, and market sensitivity; and \n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to societal trends and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in tone, structure, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is well-structured and fluent. It uses \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致\" and \"bilingual journals and specialized publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" for \"每星期開放6日\" and \"information centre\" for \"資訊中心.\" However, it uses \"communication and engagement\" for \"溝通及聯繫,\" which is slightly broader than the original.\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致\" and \"produces a variety of Chinese and English publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" and \"information centre.\" However, it uses \"liaison work\" for \"工作,\" which is not as precise as \"work in communication and engagement.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and tone. It uses \"committed to achieving\" for \"致力達致\" and \"bilingual journals and special publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" and \"information centre.\" However, it uses \"digital era\" for \"數碼時代,\" which is slightly less precise than \"digital age.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version is accurate and concise. It uses \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致\" and \"bilingual journals and special publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" and \"information centre.\" However, it uses \"issued by\" for \"出版,\" which is slightly less precise than \"produced by.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致\" and \"bilingual journals and special topic publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" and \"information centre.\" However, it uses \"contact\" for \"聯繫,\" which is slightly broader than the original.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is well-structured and accurate. It uses \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致\" and \"Chinese and English journals and special publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物.\" It correctly uses \"six days a week\" and \"information centre.\" However, it uses \"Functions\" for \"職能,\" which is less precise than \"Functions of the Institution.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the dictionary terms correctly. It should also maintain the tone and structure of the original text. Based on the above review, the best translation would combine the strengths of the first, third, and sixth translations, using \"strives to achieve\" for \"致力達致,\" \"bilingual journals and special publications\" for \"各種中英文期刊及專題刊物,\" \"six days a week\" for \"每星期開放6日,\" and \"information centre\" for \"資訊中心.\" It should also use \"communication and engagement\" for \"溝通及聯繫\" and \"Functions of the Institution\" for \"機構職能.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to achieve the highest international standards of transparency, maintaining extensive contact with the media while also publishing various bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a large number of publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials produced by the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office houses an information centre, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open six days a week for public visiting and use. Details regarding the HKMA's work in communication and engagement with the public can be found in the chapter titled \"Functions of the Institution\" (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has gradually increased the frequency of publishing data on the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA participated in the International Monetary Fund's \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" (SDDS) program for central banks since 1999. The HKMA also publishes meeting records of the Currency Board Advisory Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has carried banking sector regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Legislative Council is vital to enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has committed to providing three briefings annually to the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee on the Authority's various operations and policies, and to answer related questions. Additionally, Hong Kong Monetary Authority representatives frequently attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Affairs Committee and subcommittees to explain and discuss special matters, as well as to assist legislators in reviewing draft ordinances.\n\n# Monitoring Measures\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure the upholding of high standards of staff conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. The internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of whether the monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and effective.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that all staff members meet the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring is incorrect because the dictionary specifies that \"內部監\" should be translated as either \"internal controls\" or \"internal control matters.\" \"Internal monitoring\" is not an acceptable translation for this term. The other translations are more accurate, but they differ in formatting and capitalization.\nThe first, second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Internal Controls\" or \"internal controls,\" which are both acceptable, though \"Internal Controls\" with capital letters is more appropriate for a heading. The third translation uses lowercase, which may be less formal and less suitable for a title.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"Internal Controls\" with proper capitalization, as it aligns with the dictionary options and is suitable for a heading.\nInternal Controls\n\n# Operation Monitoring\nThe original text is \"# 運作監控\". The term \"運作\" should be translated as \"Operation\" or \"Operations\" and \"監控\" should be translated as \"Monitoring\" or \"Controls\". The translations provided by the junior translators have varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nThe first junior translator's translation, \"Operation monitoring\", is grammatically correct but lacks the proper capitalization for a title. The second junior translator's translation, \"monitoring controls\", reverses the order of the terms and may not accurately reflect the intended meaning. The third and fifth junior translators' translations, \"Operation Monitoring\", are accurate and properly capitalized. The fourth junior translator's translation, \"# Operation Monitoring\", includes an unnecessary hashtag. The sixth junior translator's translation, \"Operations Monitoring\", is also accurate but uses \"Operations\" instead of \"Operation\".\nConsidering the above, \"Operation Monitoring\" is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly translates \"運作\" as \"Operation\" and \"監控\" as \"Monitoring\", and it is properly capitalized as a title. It also avoids the unnecessary hashtag used in one of the translations. Therefore, \"Operation Monitoring\" is the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and divisions have the responsibility to assess the risks of their work processes and formulate appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the proper day-to-day operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others. The first, third, fifth, and sixth translations are the most accurate in terms of vocabulary and grammar, while the second and fourth translations contain some errors or awkward phrasing.\nThe first translation is fluent and accurate, but it uses \"branches\" for \"分處,\" which may not be the most precise term in this context. The third translation is also accurate, but it uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"the HKMA,\" which is less concise. The fifth translation is concise and accurate, using \"are responsible for\" instead of \"have the responsibility to,\" which is more natural in English. The sixth translation is also accurate, but it uses \"sub-departments\" for \"分處,\" which may not be the best fit.\nThe second translation contains a grammatical error with \"assessment\" instead of \"assess,\" and it uses \"operational stability\" instead of \"proper,\" which is not the best fit for \"穩妥.\" The fourth translation is awkward in its phrasing, using \"and functional units all have the responsibility\" which is not natural in English.\nThe best translation would be a combination of the strengths of the most accurate translations. It should use \"departments and divisions\" for \"部門及分處,\" \"assess\" for \"評估,\" \"formulate\" for \"制定,\" \"monitoring measures\" for \"監控措施,\" \"ensure\" for \"確保,\" and \"proper\" for \"穩妥.\" It should also use \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"the HKMA\" for the organization's name, depending on the context.\nTherefore, the best possible translation would be:\nAs the first line of defence in risk management, all departments and divisions have the responsibility to assess the risks of their work processes and formulate appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the proper day-to-day operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the relevant monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is a heading, \"# 內部審計,\" which translates to \"Internal Audit.\" The junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms \"內部\" and \"審計\" and translated them as \"internal\" and \"audit,\" respectively. However, there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization among the translations.\nTranslation 1: \"Internal Audit\" – This is a standard and appropriate heading format in English, with proper capitalization.\nTranslation 2: \"# Internal Audit\" – This preserves the original formatting with the hashtag, which may be appropriate if the heading is intended to be used in a digital or document format that includes such markers.\nTranslation 3: \"internal audit\" – This is grammatically correct but lacks the proper capitalization typically used for headings.\nTranslation 4: \"# Internal Audit\" – Same as Translation 2, preserving the hashtag and proper capitalization.\nTranslation 5: \"Internal audit\" – This is grammatically correct but uses lowercase for \"audit,\" which may not be ideal for a heading.\nTranslation 6: \"# Internal Audit\" – Same as Translation 2 and 4, preserving the hashtag and proper capitalization.\nConsidering the context and the need for a clear, professional heading, the best translation would be \"Internal Audit\" without the hashtag, as it is the most standard and widely accepted format for such headings in English. However, if the hashtag is necessary for formatting purposes, \"# Internal Audit\" would also be acceptable. Given that the original text includes the hashtag, it is reasonable to preserve it in the translation. Therefore, the best possible translation is \"# Internal Audit.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Internal Audit Division independently assesses the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments to determine their adequacy and effectiveness, and proposes recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Commission does not charge any fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5

盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13

Economy and Financial Environment\n\nFaced with the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightened financial conditions, and a challenging external environment, Hong Kong's economy significantly contracted in 2022. The labor market deteriorated for a period of time before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also faced pressure. Benefiting from the full re-opening between Mainland China and Hong Kong, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, dragged down by various adverse factors in the local and external environments (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, due to the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, private consumption fell sharply in the first quarter. Subsequently, private consumption recorded quarterly growth, benefiting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the boosting effect of the government's consumption voucher scheme. Under weak business sentiment and tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure significantly declined compared to 2021. Externally, with weakened external demand and disrupted cross-border land freight between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's goods exports declined. Exports of services remained generally weak, partly reflecting the low level of inbound tourism activities, but the situation slightly improved in the fourth quarter following the government's revocation of mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Domestic GDP Growth  \nSource: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Period-over-Period)  \nNote: The magnitude of quarterly changes in the seasonally adjusted total domestic fixed capital formation is not available.  \nSource: Hong Kong Government Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the year-on-year core inflation rate gradually increased to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of elevated external energy and food prices partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, especially soft housing rentals (Chart 2). Furthermore, under weak economic activity, nominal wage growth and commercial property rentals continued to remain soft, which also helped keep inflation in check. For the whole year of 2022, the core and overall inflation rates were respectively 1.7% and 1.9%.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and naturalness. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"labour market condition\" and \"year-on-year increase.\" However, \"labour force decreased slightly by 1.5% in December\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"pre-pandemic levels\" instead of \"pre-COVID-19 levels,\" which is slightly more natural. The structure is consistent and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very natural and fluent. It uses \"amid the pandemic\" and \"rebounded\" effectively. However, \"the unemployment rate of most sectors falling\" is slightly less precise than \"unemployment rates in most sectors falling.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is accurate and natural. It uses \"total employment numbers\" and \"annual growth rates,\" which are precise. However, \"annual growth rates\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"year-on-year increase.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and natural. It uses \"pre-pandemic levels\" and \"vacancies in private sector institutions,\" which are precise. However, \"by December\" is slightly less natural than \"in December.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very accurate and natural. It uses \"under the impact of the pandemic\" and \"have recovered,\" which are appropriate. However, \"have recovered\" is slightly less precise than \"recovered\" in the context of a report.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"labour market conditions\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n- Use \"pre-pandemic levels\" for naturalness.\n- Use \"year-on-year increase\" for precision.\n- Use \"recovered\" rather than \"have recovered\" for clarity.\n- Use \"labour force participation rate\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly, such as \"nominal wage\" and \"total employment.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nLabor market conditions deteriorated rapidly at the beginning of 2022 amid the pandemic, but subsequently continued to improve. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April before significantly declining to 3.5% in December (Chart 3), with unemployment rates in most sectors falling. Total employment (Chart 3) and private sector job vacancies recovered, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. The year-on-year increase in nominal wage and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, compared to the same period last year, the labor force decreased slightly by 1.5% in December, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nChart 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Government Statistics Department and Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff estimated figures\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a report or publication, describing the state of the labour market and citing the source of the data. The key terms to be translated are \"圖\", \"勞工\", \"市場\", \"狀況\", \"政府\", \"處\", \"來源\", and \"資料\".\n- **\"圖\"** should be translated as \"Figure\" (singular, as it refers to one specific figure).\n- **\"勞工\"** is best translated as \"labour\" (as per the dictionary, and it is the most natural and commonly used term in this context).\n- **\"市場\"** is translated as \"market\" (the most general and appropriate term here, as the context is about the labour market).\n- **\"狀況\"** is best translated as \"conditions\" (as it refers to the state or situation of the market).\n- **\"政府\"** should be translated as \"Government\" (capitalized, as it refers to an official entity).\n- **\"處\"** is best translated as \"Department\" (as it refers to a government department).\n- **\"來源\"** is best translated as \"Source\" (singular, as it refers to one source).\n- **\"資料\"** is best translated as \"data\" (as it refers to the information used in the figure).\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses \"Figure 3 Labour Market Conditions\" and \"Statistics Department of the Government\".  \n   - However, \"Statistics Department of the Government\" is slightly awkward; \"Government Statistics Department\" is more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Labour market positions\" instead of \"conditions\", which is incorrect.  \n   - \"Sources: Government data\" is also awkward and less precise.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Labour Market Condition\" (singular) instead of \"Conditions\" (plural), which is less accurate.  \n   - \"Source: Government Statistics Department\" is correct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Data Sources: Government Statistics Department\" – \"Sources\" is plural, but the original text uses \"來源\" (singular), so \"Source\" is more appropriate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Labour market condition\" (singular) is less accurate than \"Conditions\" (plural).  \n   - \"Source of data: Government Statistics Department\" is slightly wordy.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 3 Labour Market Conditions\" is accurate.  \n   - \"Source: Government Statistics Department\" is also accurate and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFigure 3 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Equity Markets\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use appropriate dictionary alternatives, such as \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"local,\" \"Mainland,\" and \"COVID-19.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n- Most translations use \"Figure 4\" or \"Chart 4\" appropriately, and the dates are generally accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 situation,\" which is slightly vague compared to \"outbreak\" or \"pandemic.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"the Mainland's COVID-19 outbreak\" and \"tightening of global financial conditions,\" which are accurate but could be more concise.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"the Russia-Ukraine environment,\" which is not an exact match for \"局勢\" (situation\/environment) and is less natural than \"situation.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"aggressive volatilities,\" which is not a standard phrase and may be confusing. It also uses \"minimum level\" instead of \"lowest level.\"\n- **Translation 5** and **Translation 6** are the most fluent and accurate, using \"local\" and \"Mainland\" consistently and avoiding awkward phrasing.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"local\" for \"本港\" and \"Mainland\" for \"內地.\"\n- \"局勢\" should be translated as \"situation\" rather than \"environment.\"\n- \"觸發\" should be \"triggered\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"調整\" should be \"adjustment\" or \"adjustments.\"\n- \"優化\" should be \"enhanced\" or \"optimized.\"\n- \"指數\" should be \"Hang Seng Index\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"圖\" should be \"Figure\" or \"Chart.\"\n- \"年內\" should be \"during the year\" or \"in the year.\"\n- \"下跌\" should be \"declined\" or \"fell.\"\n- \"顯著\" should be \"notably\" or \"markedly.\"\n- \"幅度\" should be \"magnitude.\"\n- \"轉差\" should be \"deteriorated.\"\n- \"金融\" should be \"financial\" or \"financial sector.\"\n- \"環球\" should be \"global.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most fluent translations while ensuring strict adherence to the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe local stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Continuing the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022, the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The stock market underwent a notable adjustment, initially triggered by heightened market concerns over the local COVID-19 outbreak, US interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine situation. Subsequently, the tightening of global financial conditions and the Mainland's COVID-19 outbreak led to a deterioration in the global economic outlook, further expanding the magnitude of the adjustment. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the last two months of the year, partly supported by the Mainland's optimized pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points at year-end, significantly down 15.5% compared to the end of 2021, marking a third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Markets\n\nUnder tightened financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market has also come under pressure. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Chart 4), with transaction volume sharply decreasing by 39% to 45,050 cases, reaching its lowest level on record. Despite the decline in property prices, the affordability of home purchases remains tight. Actual mortgage interest rates rose during the year from about 1.6% to 3.375% to 3.625%, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for property owners. The non-residential property market has also further softened. Amid elevated vacancy rates, prices have declined, and rents have remained soft.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure (圖4) that refers to \"資產價格\" (asset prices) and cites the source as \"差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\" (Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited). The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the goal is to ensure that the correct terms are used in context while maintaining fluency and clarity.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Correctly uses \"Figure 4 Asset Prices\" and \"Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department\" (though \"Rating and Valuation Department\" is more accurate than \"Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" as per the dictionary).  \n   - \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" is correctly translated.  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of terms, proper structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Rating and Valuation Department\" should be \"Rating and Valuation Department\" (not \"Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" in the source).\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Chart 4\" instead of \"Figure 4\" – both are acceptable, but \"Figure\" is more common in academic or formal contexts.  \n   - \"Source\" is correctly used, and the department name is accurate.  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Chart\" may be less formal than \"Figure.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Figure 4 asset prices\" with lowercase \"asset prices\" – should be capitalized as a title.  \n   - \"Source of information\" is slightly wordy compared to \"Source.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct department name.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lowercase title, wordy phrasing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Matches the first junior translator’s translation, with the same strengths and weaknesses.  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as first junior translator.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Figure 4: Asset Prices. Sources: Government Rent Property Valuation Department...\" – \"Government Rent Property Valuation Department\" is incorrect. The correct term is \"Rating and Valuation Department.\"  \n   - \"Government Rent\" is not the correct translation for \"差餉\" in this context.  \n   - **Strengths:** Proper use of \"Sources.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrect department name, incorrect translation of \"差餉.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Uses \"Chart 4 asset prices\" with lowercase and incorrect phrasing.  \n   - \"Rating property property markets\" is incorrect and redundant.  \n   - \"Hong Kong’s Clearing Limited\" is not the correct translation of \"香港交易及結算所有限公司.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** None.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Multiple errors in translation and structure.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Figure 4\" as it is more formal and commonly used in captions. \"Asset Prices\" should be capitalized as a title. The source should be \"Rating and Valuation Department\" and \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\" both of which are correctly translated in the first and fourth junior translators’ versions. The use of \"Source\" is more concise and appropriate than \"Sources\" or \"Source of information.\" The final translation should be clear, concise, and grammatically correct, using the dictionary terms accurately.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nRiding on the full re-opening of travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth in 2023 will recover from a low base. Although the slowdown in growth forecasts for advanced economies will continue to drag down Hong Kong's goods exports, the recovery of the Mainland economy and the removal of cross-border land freight restrictions should provide support to Hong Kong's economy. The full re-opening of travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit Hong Kong's inbound tourism and other exports of services, and boost local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to further improve under a stronger labor market. The government forecasts that the real gross domestic product (GDP) for the whole of 2023 will grow significantly, ranging between 3.5% and 5.5%. However, Hong Kong's economic growth outlook remains affected by numerous risks and uncertainties, and largely depends on the interest rate path of the US Federal Reserve, the global growth outlook, the continued tension in the geopolitical situation, and the pace of recovery in local inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Markets\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms \"通脹\" and \"勞工市場\" and translated them as \"Inflation\" and \"Labour Market\" or \"labour markets.\" However, there are some nuances to consider for a more natural and accurate translation.\nThe term \"通脹\" is consistently translated as \"Inflation,\" which is correct. However, the dictionary provides multiple options, including \"inflation rate,\" but in this context, \"inflation\" is the most appropriate and concise choice.\nThe term \"勞工市場\" is translated as \"Labour Market\" or \"labour markets.\" The use of \"markets\" in plural form may be more appropriate if the context implies multiple labour markets, but given the heading format, \"Labour Market\" is more likely the intended singular form.\nThe term \"市場\" has several possible translations, including \"market,\" \"markets,\" \"Asset markets,\" \"property market,\" etc. However, in the context of \"勞工市場,\" the most appropriate translation is \"market\" or \"markets,\" depending on whether it refers to a singular or plural concept.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Inflation and Labour Markets,\" which is concise, accurate, and uses the most appropriate terms from the dictionary.\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external prices are expected to remain elevated, the upward momentum of external prices may further weaken due to the softening of economic activity in some major economies and the easing of upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, as the local economy recovers and the labor market improves, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but the relatively soft housing rental market should continue to offset their impact to some extent. The government forecasts that the overall and core inflation rates for the whole year of 2023 will be 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to further improve as local economic activities return to normal.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\nThe original text is \"# 銀行體系表現,\" which translates to \"Banking System Performance\" or \"Banking Sector Performance.\" The dictionary provides multiple options for \"體系\" (system, systems, sector, ecosystem, systematically) and \"銀行\" (bank, banking sector, banks, banking industry, banking, Banks). The term \"表現\" is clearly defined as \"performance.\"\nReview of the junior translations:\n1. **\"Banking sector performance\"** – This is concise and accurate, using \"sector\" for \"體系\" and \"performance\" for \"表現.\" It is grammatically correct and fluent.\n2. **\"# Banking System Performance\"** – The use of \"system\" for \"體系\" is acceptable, but \"system\" may be less appropriate than \"sector\" in this context. The hashtag is retained, which is fine if it's part of the intended formatting.\n3. **\"# Banking Sector Performance\"** – This is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses \"sector\" for \"體系,\" which is appropriate in the context of the banking industry. The hashtag is also preserved, matching the original format.\n4. **\"Banking sector performance\"** – Identical to the first translation, which is correct and fluent.\n5. **\"Banking System Performance\"** – Similar to translation 2, but without the hashtag. \"System\" is less precise than \"sector\" in this context.\n6. **\"Banking System Performance\"** – Identical to translation 5, which is grammatically correct but less natural than using \"sector.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement:** While all translations are grammatically correct, \"sector\" is more appropriate than \"system\" in the context of \"銀行體系\" (banking system\/sector). \"Sector\" better conveys the idea of a part of the economy or industry, which aligns with the term \"體系\" in this context. Additionally, the use of a hashtag (#) in translations 2 and 3 matches the original format, which is likely intentional.\n**Best possible translation:** \"# Banking Sector Performance\" is the most accurate and natural translation, using the most appropriate terms from the dictionary and preserving the original formatting.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but \"variant\" is used for \"第五波新冠病毒疫情\" (fifth wave of the coronavirus), which is less precise than \"wave.\" Also, \"maintain buffers\" is awkward; \"maintained adequate buffers\" would be better.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very strong. It uses \"fifth wave of COVID-19\" correctly, \"resilient\" is a good choice for \"應付裕如,\" and \"remained ample\" is natural. The use of \"net interest income\" is accurate. However, \"fees and carried interest\" is slightly off; \"fee and commission income\" is more precise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic\" and \"intensified geopolitical tensions,\" which are appropriate. \"Handled them effectively\" is a good rendering of \"應付裕如.\" The only minor issue is \"prompted an increase in banks' net interest income\" could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very close to the best. It uses \"coronavirus\" instead of \"pandemic,\" which is slightly less precise. \"Well-prepared\" is a good choice for \"應付裕如.\" However, \"expenses and commission income\" is not accurate; \"fee and commission income\" is better.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"novel coronavirus\" and \"handled them well,\" which are good. However, \"conditions\" is used for \"狀況,\" which is acceptable but \"positions\" might be more precise in a financial context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses \"fifth wave of the novel coronavirus,\" \"handled them well,\" and \"fee and commission income.\" It also uses \"conditions\" for \"狀況,\" which is acceptable but \"positions\" might be more precise in a financial context.\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best version is the sixth junior translator’s, but it can be slightly refined. \"Conditions\" should be replaced with \"positions\" for financial terms like \"資本及流動性狀況.\" Also, \"novel coronavirus\" is slightly more verbose than \"COVID-19.\" The use of \"prompted\" is good, but \"helped\" or \"enabled\" could be alternatives. \"Fee and commission income\" is the most accurate for \"費用與佣金收入.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year, rising geopolitical tensions, and aggressive interest rate hikes by major global central banks in response to rising inflation. Faced with these challenges, the Hong Kong banking system handled them well, with capital and liquidity positions continuing to remain ample. During the year, credit risk faced by the banking system increased, but the overall quality of assets remained at a healthy level. Meanwhile, the rise in interest rates helped increase banks' net interest income, but this positive impact was partially offset by an increase in bad debt provisions and a decline in fee and commission income. Overall, retail banking profits improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit some inconsistencies and minor errors that could be refined for clarity and precision. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Junior Translator**: This translation is clear and accurate, with appropriate use of financial terminology. It correctly uses \"specific classification loan ratio\" and \"credit provisions coverage ratio.\" However, the phrase \"non-performing loan balance\" is slightly off; the original refers to \"呆壞帳餘額,\" which is more accurately translated as \"bad debt balance.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator**: This version is also accurate and well-structured. It uses \"specific classified loan rate\" and \"credit provision coverage ratio\" appropriately. However, the phrase \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classified loans\" is slightly more precise than \"credit provisions and specific classification loan ratio.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator**: This translation is fluent but has some awkward phrasing, such as \"by end-2021\" and \"by end-2022,\" which are less standard than \"at the end of 2021\" or \"by the end of 2022.\" It also uses \"realized value of collateral\" instead of \"realizable value of collateral,\" which is more standard in financial contexts.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator**: This version is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"specific classified loan ratio\" and \"credit provision coverage ratio\" correctly. The phrase \"collateralized assets\" is slightly off; the original refers to \"抵押品變現價值,\" which is better translated as \"realizable value of collateral.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and well-written. It uses \"Figure 5\" and \"Figure 6\" instead of \"Chart 5\" and \"Chart 6,\" which is acceptable but less common in financial reports. It also uses \"loan ratings\" instead of \"credit ratings,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator**: This version is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"credit provision coverage ratio\" correctly and \"realized value of collateral\" appropriately. However, the phrase \"credit provision coverage ratio was approximately 140%\" is slightly less precise than \"credit provision coverage ratio is approximately 140%.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use standard financial terminology. It should also maintain the structure and clarity of the original text. Based on the above review, the first and second translations are the most accurate, but the second one has slightly more precise terminology. The best possible translation would combine the strengths of these translations, ensuring that all terms are translated accurately and that the financial terminology is standard and clear.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe specific classification loan ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The specific classification loan ratio for related loans in Mainland China was 2.21% at the end of 2022, also up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The increase in the specific classification loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in credit ratings of some Mainland real estate developers. Despite this, banks maintained robust provisions. As at the end of 2022, the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio) remained approximately at 80%. If the realizable value of collateral is deducted from the bad debt balance, the credit provision coverage ratio is approximately 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained at a low level at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nNote: The figures cover the Hong Kong office, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nChart 6: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profitability Trends\n\nThe banking system continued to record profits in 2022. During the year, the overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks rose by 19.0% (Chart 7). The improvement in profits was driven by higher net interest income (+34%) and increased income from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), although some of the growth was offset by a rise in provisions for bad debts (+151%) and a decline in fee and commission income (-19%). In the context of rising interest rates, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Chart 8). Increased market volatility during the year also contributed to higher income from the foreign exchange and derivatives business. The increase in provisions for bad debts was due to the need to set aside special provisions for newly classified loans, while weak performance in financial markets led to a decline in fee and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banks fell from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nFigure 7: Retail Banking Performance  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, and the translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: \"Figure 7 Banks’ performance. Sources: Financial Supervisory Commission.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"圖\" as \"Figure\" and uses \"Banks’ performance\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Sources\" is plural, but the original uses \"資料來源\" (singular). Also, \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" is not the correct translation for \"金管局\" (HKMA).  \n   - **Improvement**: Use \"Source\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: \"Figure 7 Performance of Retail Banking. Source: HKMA.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Retail Banking\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Performance of Retail Banking\" is slightly awkward phrasing.  \n   - **Improvement**: \"Retail Banking Performance\" is more concise and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: \"Figure 7 Retail banks’ performance. Source of data: Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Retail banks’ performance\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Source of data\" is not the best phrasing; \"Data Source\" is more standard. Also, \"Monetary Authority\" is not specific enough for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Improvement**: Use \"Source\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: \"Figure 7: Performance of Retail Banks. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Figure 7:\" and \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Performance of Retail Banks\" is slightly wordy.  \n   - **Improvement**: \"Retail Banking Performance\" is more concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: \"Figure 7: Retail Banking's Performance. Source: HKMA.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Retail Banking's Performance\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Retail Banking's Performance\" is slightly less natural than \"Retail Banking Performance.\"  \n   - **Improvement**: Use \"Retail Banking Performance\" for a more standard title format.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: \"Figure 7 Retail Banking Performance. Data Source: Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Retail Banking Performance\" and \"Data Source.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monetary Authority\" is not specific enough for \"金管局.\"  \n   - **Improvement**: Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:  \nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terminology. \"Figure 7: Retail Banking Performance. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses the correct term for \"圖\" (\"Figure\"), correctly translates \"零售銀行\" as \"Retail Banking,\" and uses the appropriate term for \"金管局\" (\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"). The phrase \"Retail Banking Performance\" is concise and natural, and \"Source\" is the correct singular form of \"資料來源.\"\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a caption for a chart, which should be concise and precise. The term \"圖\" is best translated as \"Figure\" in this context, as it is commonly used for chart captions. \"零售銀行\" should be \"retail banks\" to maintain clarity and specificity. \"淨息差\" is best rendered as \"net interest margin,\" a standard financial term. \"資料來源：金管局\" should be translated as \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" as \"金管局\" refers specifically to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. The first translation uses \"Figure 8 Net interest spread of retail banks\" and \"Source of information: Monetary Authority.\" While \"net interest spread\" is a possible translation, \"net interest margin\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. Also, \"Monetary Authority\" is too vague and should be specified as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\nThe second translation uses \"Chart 8 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\" and \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" \"Chart\" is acceptable, but \"Figure\" is more standard for captions. \"Retail Banking\" is a bit vague compared to \"retail banks.\"\nThe third translation uses \"Figure 8 Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\" and \"Data Source: Monetary Authority.\" \"Data Source\" is slightly more formal than necessary, and \"Monetary Authority\" should be specified.\nThe fourth translation uses \"Figure 8 Retail bank net interest difference\" and \"Sources: Financial Supervisory Commission.\" \"Net interest difference\" is not the standard term, and \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" is incorrect for \"金管局.\"\nThe fifth translation uses \"Figure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\" and \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is accurate and fluent, with the only minor issue being the use of a colon after \"Figure 8.\"\nThe sixth translation uses \"Figure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is also accurate and fluent, with the only minor issue being the use of a period after \"Banks\" before the \"Source\" line.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would use \"Figure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\" with \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" to ensure clarity, accuracy, and standard financial terminology.\n\nFigure 9 Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, specifically \"圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率 資料來源：金管局.\" The goal is to translate this into a clear, concise, and professionally appropriate English caption.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 9 Retail banking cost and income ratio\" is grammatically correct but lacks the term \"to\" in \"cost-to-income ratio,\" which is a standard financial term.  \n   - \"Data Sources: Monetary Authority\" is vague and does not specify the full name of the authority.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - \"Chart 9 Retail Banking Cost and Income Ratio\" is close but again omits \"to\" in \"cost-to-income ratio.\"  \n   - \"Source: HKMA\" is more concise but may not be as clear to all readers who may not know what HKMA stands for.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 9: Retail Bank Costs and Income Ratio. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - This is more complete and accurate, using the full name of the authority. However, \"Retail Bank\" should be \"Retail Banking\" to match the original term \"零售銀行.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Chart 9 Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"  \n   - This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses the correct financial term \"cost-to-income ratio\" and provides the full name of the authority. However, the lack of a period after \"Ratio\" and the lack of a space between \"Ratio\" and \"Source\" slightly affect readability.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 9 Retail Banking Costs and Income Ratio Data Source: Monetary Authority\"  \n   - This is similar to the first translation but uses \"Data Source\" instead of \"Source.\" It also omits \"to\" in \"cost-to-income ratio.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 9 Retail bank costs and income ratio Sources: Financial Supervisory Agency\"  \n   - This translation incorrectly identifies the authority as \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also uses \"bank\" instead of \"banking\" and \"Sources\" in plural form, which is not appropriate for a single source.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct financial term \"cost-to-income ratio.\"\n- Use the full name of the authority: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Maintain the correct grammatical structure and punctuation.\n- Ensure consistency with the dictionary terms provided.\nBased on this reasoning, the best translation is:\n**Figure 9 Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority**\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the appropriate dictionary entries for terms like \"貸款總額\" (total loans), \"銀行\" (banking system), \"外匯\" (foreign exchange), and \"貿易融資\" (trade finance).\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of terms like \"balance sheet,\" \"market value,\" and \"loan demand\" is consistent and accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"2022 year\" instead of \"in 2022\" and fails to use the correct term for \"貸款總額\" (total loans), using \"total loans decreased 3.0% in 2022\" instead of \"total loans decreased by 3.0%.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"outside of Hong Kong\" instead of \"outside Hong Kong\" and omits the \"following\" in the last sentence, which is a key term from the dictionary.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Of which\" instead of \"Among them\" and \"slightly increased by 0.9%\" instead of \"edged up by 0.9%,\" which is a more natural phrasing.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"mark-to-market valuations\" which is a more precise financial term but may be slightly more complex than necessary.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"total loan amount\" instead of \"total loans\" and \"increased slightly by 0.9%\" instead of \"edged up by 0.9%.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly and consistently.\n- Use more natural phrasing such as \"edged up\" instead of \"slightly increased.\"\n- Maintain consistency in the use of terms like \"total loans\" and \"loan demand.\"\n- Ensure that the structure of the sentences is fluent and grammatically correct.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022. The increase in assets was due to a rise in the market value of foreign exchange and derivative holdings. Facing external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to a 3.8% increase recorded in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Among them, loans used outside Hong Kong decreased by 10.2%, trade finance decreased by 13.5%, while loans used in Hong Kong edged up by 0.9%. Loans related to Mainland China, which grew by 3.7% in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nIn the liability section of the balance sheet, deposits in the banking system continued to record moderate growth. The total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2021. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly dropped from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nBanks maintained ample capital positions in 2022. At the end of 2022, the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Chart 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio at the end of 2022 was 7.9% (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 11 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorised Institutions  \nSource: HKMA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a financial or regulatory report. It includes key terms such as “圖” (Figure), “本地註冊認可機構” (Locally Registered Authorised Institutions), “綜合資本比率” (Comprehensive Capital Ratio), and “資料來源：金管局” (Data Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority).\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"Figure 11\" and \"Comprehensive Capital Ratio.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Domestic Authorised Institutions\" is slightly off; \"本地註冊\" implies \"Locally Registered,\" not just \"Domestic.\" Also, \"Monetary Authority\" is vague; \"HKMA\" is more precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"locally authorized institutions\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Comprehensive capital ratios\" is plural, but the original is singular. \"Source of data\" is awkward phrasing.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Figure 11\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: The sentence structure is awkward (\"Figure 11 charts the...\"), and \"Sources\" is plural when the original refers to a single source.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Includes \"Locally Registered Authorised Institutions\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: Adds \"Registered\" unnecessarily; the original only mentions \"本地註冊認可機構\" (Locally Registered Authorised Institutions), not \"Registered and Authorised.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Domestically Registered Authorized Institutions\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Domestically Registered\" is not the best fit for \"本地註冊\" (Locally Registered). Also, \"HKMA\" is correctly used.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Locally Registered Authorised Institutions\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Source: HKMA\" is correct, but the sentence could be more concise.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Figure 11\" as the heading.\n- Accurately translate \"本地註冊認可機構\" as \"Locally Registered Authorised Institutions.\"\n- Use \"Comprehensive Capital Ratio\" as the term is singular in the original.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the source, which is more precise than \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- Keep the structure concise and professional, as it is a caption for a figure.\nThus, the improved translation is:\n**Figure 11 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorised Institutions  \nSource: HKMA**\n\nChart 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorised Institutions. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a caption for a figure, likely from a financial or regulatory report, and it includes specific terminology that must be translated accurately based on the provided dictionary. The translations by junior translators vary in quality, with some being more accurate and fluent than others.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Correctly uses \"Chart 12\" and \"Locally Registered Authorised Institutions.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* Uses \"of\" instead of the more natural \"’s\" in \"Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorised Institutions.\" Also, \"HKMA\" is abbreviated, which is acceptable but not fully spelled out.\n2. **Second Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Figure 12\" and \"Data Source: HKMA,\" which is accurate.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Data Source\" is slightly redundant since \"Source\" alone is sufficient in captions.\n3. **Third Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Figure 12\" and \"Source of data: HKMA,\" which is clear.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Domestic authorised institutions’ comprehensive leverage ratios\" is grammatically correct but less formal than the other translations.\n4. **Fourth Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Figure 12\" and \"Sources: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Sources\" is plural, but the original text refers to a single source. Also, \"domestic\" is used instead of \"locally,\" which is less precise in this context.\n5. **Fifth Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Figure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Local\" is less precise than \"Locally\" in this context, and \"Authorized\" is capitalized unnecessarily.\n6. **Sixth Translation:**  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Figure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Domestic Registered Authorised Institutions Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Domestic\" is less precise than \"Locally\" in this context, and the lack of a colon or period between the caption and the source makes it less formal.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Figure 12\" as the standard format for captions.\n- Use \"Locally Registered Authorised Institutions\" to match the dictionary and maintain precision.\n- Use \"Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" to be both formal and informative.\n- Ensure proper punctuation and formatting for clarity and professionalism.\nThus, the improved translation is:\n**Figure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorised Institutions. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).**\n\n# Liquidity Condition\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"robust\" for \"穩健\" and \"statutory minimum requirements\" for \"法定最低要求.\" It correctly uses \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"serving as a key pillar\" which is slightly less direct than \"becoming an important pillar.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"becoming an important pillar\" and \"intensifying uncertainties,\" which are accurate. However, it uses \"Figure\" instead of \"Chart\" for the figures, which may be inconsistent with the original's use of \"圖.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is also fluent and accurate, using \"robust\" and \"becoming an important pillar.\" It correctly uses \"Chart\" and \"respectively.\" However, it uses \"has continued to remain\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"continued to remain.\"\n4. **Translation 4** has some inconsistencies. It uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" instead of \"Category 1\" and \"Category 2,\" which may not align with the dictionary's \"第\" as \"th.\" It also uses \"macro economy\" instead of \"macroeconomic environment,\" which is less precise. Additionally, \"funding Sources\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 1 and is fluent and accurate. It uses \"robust,\" \"becoming an important pillar,\" and \"Chart\" consistently. It is one of the most accurate translations.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"Tier 1\" and \"Tier 2\" again, which may not be the best fit for \"第1類機構\" and \"第2類機構.\" It also uses \"core capital ratio\" instead of \"core funding ratio,\" which is not accurate. It uses \"maintaining ratio\" instead of \"maintenance ratio,\" which is a minor but notable error.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe liquidity position of the banking system continued to remain robust, becoming an important pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Chart 13). The primary source of funds for the banking system remains customer deposits. At the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were respectively 137.7% and 155.7% (Chart 14). All four ratios mentioned above are significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Specified Authorised Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 14: Funds Ratio of Designated Authorised Institutions.

{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n隨着美國收緊貨幣政策，港元在2022年轉弱，弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息於2022年內逐步上升。整體而言，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2022 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受到本港股市調整、市場預期美國進一步加息，以及在香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息的負息差下的套息交易帶動，港元在2022年初轉弱，並在其後的月份一直貼近弱方兌換保證水平。弱方兌換保證於5月至11月期間被觸發41次。在本港股市成交轉旺及年底季節性資金需求的帶動下，港元在11月中開始轉強（圖1）。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2022年全年繼續運作正常。\n\n為應付銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2022年初增發總值400億港元的外匯基金票據。此外，金管局在2022年5月至11月間按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率水平共買入2,421億港元。總結餘由2021年底的3,775億港元，減少至2022年底的963億港元，反映增發外匯基金票據，以及弱方兌換保證被觸發的影響。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在年內由11,488億港元，稍增至12,004億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2021年底的15,263 億港元，減少至 2022 年底的 12,967 億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖1 2022年市場匯率\n\n圖2 2022年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯匯制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元銀行同業拆息的走勢。由於美國在2022年持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息逐步上升（圖3）。全年計，隔夜、1個月及3個月香港銀行同業拆息分別上升318、419及473基點至年底時的3.23厘、4.35厘及4.99厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調，基本利率上調7次，合共4.25個百分點（即425基點），由0.5厘上升至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國上調政策利率，多間銀行在9月下旬調高最優惠貸款利率12.5基點，在11月初再調高25基點，以及在12月中再調高25基點。部分銀行亦於年內提高以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的新批按揭利率上限。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2021年的68億港元增至2022年的84億港元。\n\n圖3 2022 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n接近40年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大的應對挑戰的能力。儘管2022年全球金融狀況反覆，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織在《2022年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2022年在109.3%至111.0%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報110.1%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4 2022年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2022年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括中國內地物業市況、非銀行機構在住宅按揭市場的角色、深度學習在信用風險評估上的應用，以及一個用作評估港元流動性的監察框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n金管局繼續舉辦講座，為銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖的收銀員及學生講解香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵，提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。在2022年，金管局共舉辦15場講座，吸引4,200多名參加者。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。為應對銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求及考慮到市場情況，金管局在2022年首兩個月增發總計400億港元外匯基金票據，而總結餘亦因此相應減少。截至2022年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為12,075億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心 完成3份政策研究報告、發表24份研究論文及舉辦16場研討會╱網上研討會，內容涵蓋對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題。研究中心亦作出進一步安排，透過全新的開放取用電子期刊發布研究結果，令更廣泛的讀者接收到相關資訊。此外，研究中心在其網站推出全新系列刊物《Insights from Monetary Research Digest》， 為公眾總結研究中心最近的研究成果，提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究成果外，研究中心亦舉辦兩場國際研討會及3場網上專家研討會，促進對經濟及金融事務的對話與交流：\n\n-

Monetary Stability\n\nWith the US tightening monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened in 2022, with the weak-side exchange guarantee triggered 41 times between May and November. Driven by increased turnover in the local stock market and year-end seasonal funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally followed the trends of US dollar interbank rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes in the US, HIBORs gradually rose during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and monetary markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly trading. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all aim to convey the meaning of the original Traditional Chinese text regarding Hong Kong's monetary policy and the Currency Board system. However, they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"發行局\" as \"Currency Board.\"\n- Most translations use \"maintain currency stability\" or similar phrasing for \"維持貨幣穩定.\"\n- The term \"Monetary Base\" is consistently used for \"基礎.\"\n- The phrase \"7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar\" is accurately translated in most versions.\n- The concept of the Currency Board system and its mechanism is generally well conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"monetary stability\" instead of \"currency stability,\" which is less precise given the context of exchange rates.\n- The phrase \"helping the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate\" is awkward and not idiomatic in English.\n- The use of \"Backed\" with a capital \"B\" is inconsistent and unnecessary unless it refers to a specific entity.\n- Some translations use \"100 percent Backing\" with a capital \"B,\" which is not standard unless referring to a specific term.\n- The phrase \"fully cooperating with the percentage change\" is awkward and not idiomatic.\n- The term \"currency issuance system\" is incorrect; the correct term from the dictionary is \"Currency Board.\"\n- Some translations use \"foreign exchange market\" when the original text does not explicitly mention it, which may be an over-interpretation.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"currency stability\" consistently for \"穩定\" in the context of exchange rates.\n- Replace \"helping the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate\" with \"keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar.\"\n- Use \"support\" or \"backing\" consistently without unnecessary capitalization.\n- Replace awkward phrasing like \"fully cooperating with the percentage change\" with \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100 percent.\"\n- Ensure that \"Currency Board\" is used consistently and not replaced with \"currency issuance system.\"\n- Avoid adding \"foreign exchange market\" unless it is explicitly mentioned in the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar. This monetary system mainly adopts the Currency Board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support to the Monetary Base; if there are changes in the Monetary Base, the US dollar reserves must also be increased or decreased accordingly, matching the changes in the Monetary Base by 100 percent.\n\nThe original text outlines the components of the \"Monetary Base\" as defined in Table 1. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. However, \"Liability notes\" may not be the best term for \"負債證明書\" (Liability Certificates). Also, \"issuing banks\" is slightly vague; \"note-issuing banks\" would be more precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"Liability certificates\" correctly and \"note-issuing banks\" is accurate. However, \"total balance\" should be \"total balances\" to match the plural \"結餘總額.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"Liability Certificates\" and \"note-issuing banks\" correctly. However, \"Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" is more precise than \"Foreign exchange bills and bonds.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"Liability Certificates,\" \"note-issuing banks,\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" correctly. It also uses \"total balances\" appropriately.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has several errors. \"Liability demonstrates\" is incorrect. \"Exchange Fund notes and bonds representing the Government\" is not accurate and lacks clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"HKMA\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less formal and may not be appropriate in an official context. Also, \"as representative of the Government\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"Liability Certificates\" for \"負債證明書\" as it is the most precise and matches the dictionary.\n- Use \"note-issuing banks\" for \"發鈔銀行\" to reflect the specific role of these banks.\n- Use \"Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" for \"外匯基金票據及債券\" to ensure accuracy.\n- Use \"total balances\" for \"總餘總額\" to match the plural form.\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality.\n**Improved Translation**:\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:\n- Liability Certificates (providing full support for banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks);\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins;\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balances); and\n- Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the Convertibility Undertaking. When the strong-side (or weak-side) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the total reserves, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange rate range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary guidelines. All translations correctly use \"exchange rate\" for \"匯率\" and \"stability\" for \"穩定.\" The only variation lies in the use of punctuation and capitalization.\nThe first, second, and fifth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the text is part of a heading or section title in a document. However, if the text is meant to be a standalone phrase or title, the \"#\" may be unnecessary. The third, fourth, and sixth translations omit the \"#\" and use lowercase or a period, which may be more appropriate for a general statement or title depending on context.\nThe use of \"stability\" as the translation for \"穩定\" is appropriate in this context, as it conveys the intended meaning of maintaining a steady or unchanging state. The dictionary also includes alternatives such as \"stabilising,\" \"safeguard... stability,\" \"Stability,\" \"stable,\" and \"maintaining... stability,\" but \"stability\" is the most concise and natural choice for the given context.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Exchange rate stability,\" which is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns with the dictionary guidelines. It avoids unnecessary punctuation and capitalization unless required by the document's formatting.\n\nAffected by adjustments in the Hong Kong stock market, market expectations of further US interest rate hikes, and carry trade activities driven by the negative interest rate differential between Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) and London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBORs), the Hong Kong dollar weakened at the beginning of 2022 and remained close to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level throughout the subsequent months. The weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered 41 times between May and November. Driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and year-end seasonal funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November (Chart 1). Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the ongoing demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued additional Exchange Fund Bills totaling HK$400 billion in early 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$2,421 billion at the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), as requested by banks. Total reserves decreased from HK$3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills and the triggering of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Meanwhile, the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and bonds increased slightly from HK$11,488 billion during the year to HK$12,004 billion. Therefore, the combined total of reserves and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and bonds decreased from HK$15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Chart 2). The overall monetary base continues to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 1 2022 Market Exchange Rate\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate but have some minor issues that can be improved. The term \"圖\" is translated as \"Chart\" or \"Figure,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"Chart\" is more commonly used in the context of financial or market data. \"市場\" is correctly translated as \"Market,\" but the dictionary provides several alternatives, and \"market\" in lowercase is more natural in this context. \"年\" is translated as \"year,\" which is correct, but \"2022\" is also an option and more specific. The term \"匯率\" is correctly translated as \"exchange rate.\" The translations by the fifth and sixth junior translators have minor issues with capitalization and the use of \"year\" instead of the specific year \"2022.\" Based on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"Chart\" for \"圖,\" \"market\" for \"市場,\" and \"2022\" for \"年,\" resulting in \"Chart 1 2022 Market Exchange Rate.\"\n\nChart 2: 2022 Total Outstanding Balance (Before Conducting Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding EFBNs and Bonds\n\n# Currency Markets\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally follow the trends of U.S. dollar interbank offered rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes by the United States in 2022, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates gradually rose (Chart 3). For the whole year, overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBORs respectively increased by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by the end of the year.\n\nIn response to the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the basic interest rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (i.e., 425 basis points), rising from 0.5 percent to 4.75 percent (Chart 3). At the retail level, as the US raised its policy rates, multiple banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by another 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the cap on newly approved mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$6.8 billion in 2021 to HK$8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nChart 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating strong capacity to address challenges. Despite the fluctuating global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets maintained orderly operations, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The government is also determined to maintain the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in its \"2022 Report on the External Sector\" that Hong Kong has transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, an agile economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA robust banking system plays a crucial role in the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Hong Kong’s banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions that are exceptionally ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system has the resilience to withstand shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, while maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board's accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Chart 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide strong backing for the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system.\n\nFigure 4 2022 Daily Changes in Support Ratio\nThe original text, \"圖4 2022年支持比率每日變動,\" is a title for a chart or figure that shows the daily changes in the support ratio for the year 2022. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for each term, and the goal is to select the most appropriate ones to ensure clarity, fluency, and accuracy.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"Figure 4 2022 Support Ratio Daily Change\"** – This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"Figure\" for \"圖\" and \"Support Ratio\" for \"支持比率.\" However, \"Daily Change\" is singular, while the original uses \"每日變動,\" which implies multiple daily changes over time. A plural form might be more appropriate.\n2. **\"Figure 4 Backed ratio daily change\"** – This translation uses \"Backed\" for \"支持,\" which is less common and less natural in this context. \"Backed ratio\" is awkward and unclear. \"Daily change\" is also singular, which may not fully capture the intended meaning.\n3. **\"Figure 4 2022年 supporting rate daily changes\"** – This translation uses \"supporting rate\" for \"支持比率,\" which is not the best fit. \"Supporting\" is a verb form and does not clearly convey the noun meaning of \"support.\" Also, \"2022年\" is not translated, which is unnecessary since the year is already in English.\n4. **\"Figure 4 2022 Support Ratio Daily Change\"** – This is nearly identical to the first translation. It is accurate but could be improved by using the plural form \"Changes\" to better reflect the ongoing nature of the daily variations.\n5. **\"Chart 4 Daily Changes in 2022 Support Ratio\"** – This translation is fluent and natural. It uses \"Chart\" for \"圖\" and \"Daily Changes\" for \"每日變動,\" which is more appropriate than the singular form. However, \"Chart\" is less formal than \"Figure,\" which may be more suitable for academic or technical contexts.\n6. **\"Figure 4 Daily Changes in Support Ratio in 2022\"** – This translation is very natural and fluent. It uses \"Daily Changes\" and places the year at the end, which is a common structure in English titles. It is slightly more wordy than necessary but is still clear and accurate.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and accurate. It should use \"Figure\" for \"圖\" as it is the most common term in academic or technical contexts. \"Support Ratio\" is the best translation for \"支持比率\" as it is clear and commonly used. \"Daily Changes\" is the best fit for \"每日變動\" as it conveys the ongoing nature of the variations. The year \"2022\" should be placed after the main phrase to maintain clarity and flow.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 4 Daily Changes in Support Ratio in 2022\n\n# Monetary Committee\n\nThe original text discusses the responsibilities of the Currency Board under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, the topics it examined in 2022, and the availability of its records and reports on the HKMA website. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, which must be used accurately.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"Monetary Policy Committee\" and \"Currency Board.\" Properly uses \"liquidity of the Hong Kong dollar.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Monetary Policy Committee\" instead of \"Currency Board.\" Also, \"monetary and financial stability\" is correct, but the structure is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Currency Board\" and \"HKMA.\" Properly translates \"framework for monitoring Hong Kong dollar liquidity.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly states that the Currency Board is \"under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" but the original text says the Currency Board is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Also, \"Mainland China's property market conditions\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Currency Board\" and \"monitoring framework to assess Hong Kong dollar liquidity.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly states that the Currency Board is under the \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" instead of the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Also, \"submitted to the HKMA\" is incorrect; the reports are submitted by the HKMA to the Currency Board.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Currency Board Advisory Committee\" and \"monitoring framework used to assess Hong Kong dollar liquidity.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Currency Board Advisory Committee\" instead of the \"Currency Board.\" Also, \"submitted to it by the Currency Board\" is incorrect.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Monetary Policy Committee\" and \"liquidity of the Hong Kong dollar.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly refers to the \"Monetary Policy Committee\" instead of the \"Currency Board.\" Also, \"submitted by the HKMA to it\" is incorrect.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Currency Board\" and \"HKMA.\" Properly translates \"stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Mainland China's property market situation\" is slightly awkward. Also, \"operational reports submitted by the HKMA\" is correct, but the structure is slightly wordy.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Currency Board\" as per the dictionary, correctly identify its parent body as the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" and accurately reflect the topics discussed in 2022. It should also correctly state that the HKMA submits reports to the Currency Board and that the records and reports are available on the HKMA website.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Currency Board, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the Currency Board discussed topics including the property market situation in Mainland China, the role of non-banking institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing the liquidity of the Hong Kong dollar. Meeting records of the Currency Board and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are all available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 紙幣及硬幣\". The junior translators have all correctly translated \"紙幣\" as \"banknotes\" or \"notes\" and \"硬幣\" as \"coins,\" which aligns with the dictionary provided. However, there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization that affect the overall appearance and fluency of the translations.\nThe first, second, and fifth translations include the \"#\" symbol, which matches the original text's formatting. This is appropriate if the \"#\" is intended as a heading marker. However, the second and fifth translations use \"# Banknotes and Coins\" with a space after the \"#\", which is more standard in English formatting for headings. The first and fifth translations use \"Banknotes and Coins\" with proper capitalization, while the third, fourth, and sixth translations use \"banknotes and coins\" with lowercase, which may be less appropriate for a heading.\nThe best translation should maintain the original formatting, use proper capitalization, and ensure consistency with standard English heading conventions. Therefore, the most appropriate translation would be \"# Banknotes and Coins,\" which preserves the original structure while adhering to English typographic norms.\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to hold seminars to explain the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes to bank tellers, retail store cashiers, and students, enhancing their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes. In 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held a total of 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Plan\n\nThe Coin Collection Program continues to be popular among the public. Details of the program can be found in the \"Sustainable Development of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" chapter of the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\nThe original text is \"# 外匯基金票據及債券\". The key terms to translate are \"外匯\", \"基金\", \"票據\", and \"債券\". According to the dictionary, \"外匯\" can be translated as \"foreign exchange\", \"Foreign Exchange\", or \"Exchange Fund\", while \"基金\" can be \"funds\", \"Exchange Fund\", or \"Fund\". \"票據\" can be \"bills\" or \"notes\", and \"債券\" can be \"bonds\", \"bond\", \"bond market\", \"issuance of tokenised Government green bond\", \"bond markets\", or \"Notes\".\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in their use of these terms. The first translation, \"Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\", correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金\" and \"Bills and Bonds\" for \"票據及債券\". However, it omits the \"#\" symbol from the original text.\nThe second translation, \"Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\", uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金\" and \"Notes and Bonds\" for \"票據及債券\". This is also a correct translation, but \"Notes\" may not be the best choice for \"票據\" in this context.\nThe third translation, \"foreign exchange funds bills and bonds\", uses \"foreign exchange funds\" for \"外匯基金\" and \"bills and bonds\" for \"票據及債券\". This is a correct translation, but it lacks the proper capitalization and formatting.\nThe fourth translation, \"Foreign Exchange Fund bills and bonds\", is similar to the first translation, but it uses \"bills and bonds\" for \"票據及債券\" instead of \"Bills and Bonds\".\nThe fifth and sixth translations are identical to the first translation, but they include the \"#\" symbol from the original text.\nBased on the above analysis, the best possible translation would be \"Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\" or \"# Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\" if the \"#\" symbol is to be included. This translation accurately reflects the original text and uses the most appropriate terms from the dictionary.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. To address the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills and considering market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a total of HK$40 billion in Exchange Fund Bills during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the total outstanding amount. As at the end of 2022, the nominal total value of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds was approximately HK$1,207.5 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding EFBNs and Bonds\n\n# Currency Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) has completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars\/webinars, covering topics of monetary and financial research of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Institute also made further arrangements to publish research results through a new open-access electronic journal, enabling a broader audience to access relevant information. In addition, the Institute launched a new series of publications, *Insights from Monetary Research Digest*, on its website, providing the public with high-level, non-technical summaries of the Institute’s recent research findings.\n\nIn addition to research findings, the research centre also organised two international seminars and three online expert webinars to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial affairs.\n\nOn April 12, the Academy of Finance co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Latest Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Monetary Tightening Policy, and the Development of the Offshore Renminbi Market,\" inviting Mr. Ren Zhiqiang, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean of the National Development Research Institute at Peking University and Jin Guang Economics Chair Professor, as guest speakers. The seminar was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real time.\n\nOn June 24, an online seminar titled “Transformation and Policy Choices in China’s Real Estate Sector” was held, featuring Dr. Qin Hong, a senior researcher at Renmin University of China and former director of the Policy Research Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a guest speaker, and moderated by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS. The event attracted nearly 1.13 million real-time online viewers from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions around the world.\n\nOn August 25, a virtual workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects\" was co-hosted by the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, with a total of over 200 experts from central banks, international financial organizations, and academia around the world participating online.\n\nAs a side event of the International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, an online seminar titled \"Inflation After COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was co-hosted with the Academy of Finance on November 2nd. Dr. Qi Lianhua, founder and chief economist of the International Monetary Watch and former chief economist at J.P. Morgan, provided analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated in the online seminar.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the event as the \"12th Annual China Economic International Seminar\" and the date as \"November 23.\"\n- The theme \"China's Economic Development in a New Stage\" is consistently translated as \"A New Stage of China’s Economic Development\" or similar variations.\n- The mention of Dr. Wang Yiming, his titles, and his keynote speech on the short- and long-term outlooks for China's economy are accurately rendered in all translations.\n- The inclusion of the four chief economists from different investment banks in the Greater China region and their discussion topics (epidemic prevention, real estate, supply chain, and long-term growth) is well captured.\n- The final sentence about the number of online viewers is consistently translated as \"attracted a total of over 1.18 million online viewers.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"China International Economic Exchange Centre\" while others use \"China Center for International Economic Exchange.\" The dictionary lists \"Centre\" as a valid translation for \"中心,\" so \"China International Economic Exchange Centre\" is more consistent.\n- **Title Accuracy:** The title \"Deputy Chairman\" is used in some translations, while \"Deputy Director\" or \"Vice Chairman\" appears in others. The dictionary lists \"Vice\" and \"Deputy\" as valid translations for \"副,\" so \"Deputy Chairman\" is appropriate.\n- **\"Research Seminar\" vs. \"Seminar\":** Some translations use \"research seminar\" for \"研究會,\" but the dictionary lists \"seminar\" as a valid translation, so \"seminar\" is more accurate.\n- **\"Epidemic Prevention\" vs. \"Pandemic Control\":** While both are acceptable, \"epidemic prevention policies\" is more aligned with the original Chinese term \"防疫政策.\"\n- **\"Online Live Viewers\" vs. \"Online Viewers\":** The original text specifies \"網上實時觀看,\" which implies \"real-time online viewing.\" Thus, \"online live viewers\" is more precise than \"online viewers.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"China International Economic Exchange Centre\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Deputy Chairman\" for \"副理事長.\"\n- Use \"seminar\" rather than \"research seminar\" for \"研究會.\"\n- Use \"epidemic prevention policies\" for \"防疫政策.\"\n- Use \"online live viewers\" to reflect \"網上實時觀看.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nThe 12th Annual China Economic International Seminar was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Stage of China’s Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Deputy Chairman of the China International Economic Exchange Centre and Chairman of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech at the seminar on the short-term and long-term outlooks for China’s economy. In addition, four chief economists from different investment banks in the Greater China region shared their views on China’s epidemic prevention policies, real estate market development, supply chain restructuring, and long-term growth prospects during a panel discussion session. The seminar attracted a total of over 1.18 million online live viewers.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1

信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Banking System Stability\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but lack nuance and completeness. While all translations correctly identify \"銀行\" as \"banking\" and \"穩定\" as \"stability,\" the term \"體系\" is consistently translated as \"system,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise choice in this context. \"體系\" can imply a broader, more structured framework than just a \"system,\" and \"sector\" or \"ecosystem\" might be more appropriate depending on context. However, in the phrase \"銀行體系穩定,\" \"system\" is the most direct and commonly used translation.\nThe translations also fail to capture the full title format of the original text, which includes the \"#\" symbol. Only the fourth translation includes this symbol, making it the most faithful to the original formatting.\nIn terms of fluency and grammar, all translations are grammatically correct, but they are minimal and lack the richness of expression that a more comprehensive translation would provide. The use of \"Banking system stability\" is repetitive and does not fully convey the depth of the original phrase.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain the original formatting, accurately translate each term according to the dictionary, and ensure that the translation is both fluent and natural in English. The term \"體系\" should be translated as \"system\" in this context, as it is the most direct and commonly used translation. The term \"銀行\" should be translated as \"banking,\" and \"穩定\" should be translated as \"stability.\"\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is \"Banking System Stability,\" which accurately reflects the original meaning, maintains the original formatting, and is both fluent and natural in English.\n\nDespite the macro environment being filled with uncertainty and challenges, coupled with exceptional volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2022. During the year, the HKMA also strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions' credit and market risk management. Additionally, given the continuous increase in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector, the HKMA closely collaborated with authorized institutions to enhance the operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities of these institutions.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary, the translations vary in accuracy and naturalness. The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations are the most accurate and fluent, with the sixth being the most precise in terms of dictionary usage and clarity. The third and fourth translations contain minor inaccuracies, such as \"integrity supervision\" instead of \"conduct supervision\" and \"consumer credit supervisory system\" instead of \"trust business.\" Additionally, the third translation uses \"will be launched\" instead of \"was launched,\" which misrepresents the timeline. The fourth translation uses \"bad assets\" instead of \"bad apples,\" which is not an exact match for the original term. The fifth translation uses \"activated\" instead of \"launched,\" which is less precise in this context.\nThe best translation should use \"conduct supervision\" as per the dictionary, accurately reflect the timeline with \"was launched,\" and use \"rolling bad apple\" as the exact term. It should also use \"assist\" or \"facilitate\" for \"協助\" and \"bank accounts\" for \"戶口.\" The term \"multiple credit data service institutions\" should be used as per the dictionary, and \"Mandatory\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection for \"buy now, pay later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory authorities to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales procedures for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory system for trust business. During the year, the \"credit data platform\" under the \"multiple credit data service institutions\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new Mandatory background verification program to address the \"rolling bad apple\" phenomenon. In addition, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in introducing convenient measures to enable customers to restart their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with banks through public-private partnerships (including the anti-fraud and anti-money laundering intelligence task force) to strengthen Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing ecosystem, as well as enhance efforts to address fraud cases. Furthermore, the HKMA works with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and destabilising factors brought about by the increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA also promotes the industry's use of data and technology through its \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Lab\" series, while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in its anti-money laundering work. In international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nIn 2022, good progress was made in the local implementation of international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also vigorously enhanced the industry's soft power, including collaborating with the banking sector to establish sustainable talent reserves and enhancing the skills of existing staff members. Throughout the year, the HKMA has continued to work closely with the banking sector to improve and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Grammar and Fluency**: \n   - Translation 1 and 2 are grammatically sound and fluent. Translation 3 has a minor issue with \"at all domestically systemically important Banks\" (capitalization of \"Banks\" is inconsistent with the rest of the text). Translation 4 is well-structured and uses \"initiatives\" instead of \"work,\" which adds a slight nuance. Translation 5 is fluent but slightly less precise in the phrase \"a layer of new loss-absorbing capacity resources.\" Translation 6 has a grammatical error with \"strives\" (should be \"strives\" or \"strive,\" not \"strives to advance work both locally and internationally\").\n2. **Use of Dictionary Terms**:\n   - All translations correctly use \"resolution\" for \"處置\" and \"loss-absorbing\" for \"吸收虧損.\" However, \"systemically important\" is used inconsistently. For example, \"locally systemically important banks\" (Translation 1) is more precise than \"systemically important local banks\" (Translation 2), which may imply that the banks are local in location rather than importance.\n   - \"Ensure\" is used correctly for \"備有\" in all translations.\n   - \"Credible\" is correctly used for \"公信力.\"\n   - \"Milestone\" is used appropriately in all translations, though \"marking the HKMA's milestone\" (Translation 4) is slightly more natural than \"marking a milestone in the HKMA's efforts\" (Translation 1).\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**:\n   - \"HKMA\" is used consistently in most translations, though \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" (Translation 4) is more formal and appropriate for official contexts.\n   - \"Feasibility of resolution\" is a standard term in financial regulation and is used correctly in all translations.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific initiatives include formulating new resolution standards; conducting regional crisis simulation exercises; and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all locally systemically important banks, marking a milestone in enhancing the feasibility of resolution.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall goals is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it is essential to establish and maintain a financially resilient system with a high degree of capacity to respond and provide the key financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may impact the stability of the banking system through their operating methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly closures. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring banks have the resilience to withstand shocks and respond to crises to restore normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent closures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for prudently supervising banks and authorizing licensed banks, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudent regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities under the resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its winding-up can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capacity to deal with authorized institutions on the brink of collapse. To effectively carry out the above tasks, the HKMA adopts methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international practices.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the term \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員\" and \"financial market infrastructures\" for \"金融市場基建.\" However, some translations use \"infrastructure\" instead of \"infrastructures,\" which is less precise when referring to multiple systems. The plural \"infrastructures\" is more appropriate in this context.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The first, third, and sixth translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound. The second and fourth translations occasionally use awkward phrasing, such as \"the impact on its stability that may result from\" or \"preventing potential impacts on its stability caused by,\" which can be simplified for clarity.\n3. **Vocabulary Choice**: The term \"enhance\" is used frequently, which is appropriate. However, \"safeguard\" is more precise than \"protect\" in the context of \"保障.\" Additionally, \"systemic risks\" is more standard than \"systemic risk\" when referring to multiple risks.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The use of \"Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems\" is more natural than \"Hong Kong’s money and financial system.\" Also, \"HKMA\" should be spelled out as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention unless the context clearly implies it.\n5. **Consistency**: The sixth translation is the most consistent in using \"financial market infrastructures\" and \"systemic risks.\" It also uses \"safeguard\" and \"prevent potential impacts on their stability,\" which are more precise and natural.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and monitoring certain financial market infrastructures. The purpose of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s monitoring of financial market infrastructures is to promote the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructures, control systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Enhancing the resilience of financial market infrastructures can safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, preventing potential impacts on their stability due to disruptions in their operation.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\nThe original text is \"# 牌照事宜,\" where \"牌照\" translates to \"license\" and \"事宜\" is defined in the dictionary as either \"matters\" or \"issues.\" The junior translators have all correctly used \"License Matters\" as the translation, with some including the hashtag \"#.\" However, the use of the hashtag is not necessary unless the context specifically requires it (e.g., for social media or headings in a document). The term \"Licensing matters\" is also a valid alternative, but \"License Matters\" is more concise and natural in English.\nThe best translation is \"License Matters,\" as it is concise, natural, and accurately reflects the original meaning without unnecessary formatting.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorized six foreign trading platforms to become currency brokers, while five licensed banks and one restricted license bank had their authorization revoked.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas for improvement in terms of fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\nFirst, the term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" rather than \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Supervisory Authority,\" as this is the official name of the institution. This is correctly reflected in translations 2, 5, and 6.\nSecond, the term \"貨幣經紀\" is best translated as \"currency brokers\" rather than \"monetary brokers\" or \"money brokers,\" as \"currency\" is more precise in this financial context. Translations 2, 4, and 5 use \"currency brokers,\" which is the most appropriate choice.\nThird, the term \"持牌銀行\" should be translated as \"licensed banks,\" and \"有限制牌照銀行\" as \"restricted license banks.\" This is correctly handled in translations 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, translation 3 uses \"restricted license bank\" without the plural \"banks,\" which is inconsistent with the original text.\nFourth, the term \"認可資格\" should be translated as \"authorization\" or \"authorised status,\" and \"撤銷認可資格\" as \"had their authorization revoked.\" This is accurately reflected in translations 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nFifth, the term \"境外\" is correctly translated as \"foreign\" in translations 1, 2, 4, and 5. However, translation 5 uses \"offshore,\" which is less precise in this context.\nFinally, the use of \"while\" in translations 1, 2, 3, and 5 effectively connects the two clauses, improving the flow of the sentence. However, translation 6 uses \"Additionally,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less concise.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use the official name of the institution, the most precise financial terminology, and maintain a clear and concise structure. The final translation should reflect these considerations to ensure accuracy and fluency.\n\nFor more information on the authorised institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F, which can be found respectively on pages 283 to 286 and pages 292 to 295.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Oversight Work\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide scope, including the CAMEL assessment of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology. To continue enhancing the risk governance level of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 36 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the board, and held 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to non-site review work, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site reviews of the various business operations of authorized institutions. From a prudent supervision perspective, credit risk management is one of the key regulatory focuses. Meanwhile, as the use of technology in banking becomes increasingly widespread, operational risk and technology risk management are another regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also conducted a thematic review focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA conducts on-site reviews of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related businesses, and uses thematic assessments as a complement to examine areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 presents the summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent, with minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. All translations correctly use \"Credit Growth\" and \"Asset Quality\" as the title, which aligns with the dictionary entries for \"信貸\" as \"credit\" and \"資產\" as \"asset.\" The term \"增長\" is translated as \"Growth\" or \"growth,\" which is appropriate given the context of a title.\nHowever, the translations lack consistency in punctuation and capitalization. Some versions include a hash symbol (#) at the beginning, while others do not. Additionally, some translations end with a period, while others do not. These differences, though minor, can affect the perceived professionalism of the title.\nTo produce the best possible translation, it is important to maintain consistency in formatting and punctuation. Since the original text begins with a hash symbol, it is appropriate to retain this in the translation. Furthermore, the title should be capitalized consistently, with \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality\" being the most natural and professional choice.\nTherefore, the improved translation is:\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 shows the growth situation of various types of loans and advances. The total amount of loans related to Mainland China also decreased by 4.4% to HK$452.2 billion (Table 3).\n\nDuring the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various aspects, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the escalation of geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deterioration of the financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system maintained stability and soundness.\nDuring the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various aspects, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the escalation of geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deterioration of the financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system maintained stability and soundness.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year, but remained at a healthy level. The specific classified loan ratio in the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, higher than 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classified loan ratio for related loans in Mainland China rose from 0.89% a year ago to 2.21%.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) enhanced the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and worked closely with authorized institutions in order to timely assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of authorized institutions. The overall credit risk facing the banking system remains controllable. The results of the HKMA's stress tests show that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers, capable of withstanding extreme pressures.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) assessment of credit risk management practices among authorized institutions, with specific focus areas. The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"special assessment\" and \"review\" appropriately. However, \"more vulnerable to impact\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version is very close to the first, with the only difference being \"more vulnerable industries\" instead of \"more vulnerable to impact.\" This is more concise and natural.\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** Uses \"thematic assessment\" instead of \"special assessment,\" which is a valid alternative. However, \"sectors\" is used instead of \"industries,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This version is very accurate, using \"more susceptible to impact\" and \"customers\" instead of \"clients.\" However, \"customers\" may not be the best term in a formal regulatory context.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** Uses \"assessment\" instead of \"special assessment,\" which is less precise. Also, \"risk bearing\" is not the best term for \"risk exposure.\" \"Overseas branches\" is correct, but \"loans with collateral\" is less precise than \"secured loans.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version is the most accurate and fluent. It uses \"thematic assessment,\" which is a precise term in regulatory contexts. \"Risk-taking in sectors more susceptible to impact\" is a natural and precise phrasing. \"Credit risks of overseas branches\" and \"lending with collateral\" are also well-chosen.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use precise regulatory terminology, maintain fluency, and ensure that all terms from the dictionary are translated accurately. \"Thematic assessment\" is a more precise term than \"special assessment\" in this context. \"Risk-taking in sectors more susceptible to impact\" is a natural and precise phrasing. \"Credit risks of overseas branches\" and \"lending with collateral\" are also well-chosen.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA conducted a thematic assessment during the year to review the credit risk management of authorised institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk-taking in sectors more susceptible to impact, credit risks of overseas branches, and lending with collateral provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the whole, the translations are reasonably accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and adherence to the dictionary. The key areas of concern are:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: The dictionary provides specific translations for terms like “協調” (coordination, co-ordination, etc.), “貸款” (loans, loan, lending, etc.), and “機構” (institutions, institution, etc.). Some translations use \"corporates\" while others use \"enterprises\" or \"companies.\" The term “企業” should be translated as “enterprises” or “corporates,” and “機構” should be “institutions” or “institutions.” The term “認可” is consistently translated as “authorised” or “authorized,” which is correct.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. For example, the use of “thus enabling” or “thereby enabling” is more natural than “so as to help.” Also, the phrase “from the perspective of the common interests” is more natural than “from the joint interests.”\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term “金管局” is consistently translated as “Hong Kong Monetary Authority” or “HKMA,” which is appropriate. The title of the document, “香港企業財務困難處理守則,” is translated as “Code of Practice on Handling Financial Difficulties of Hong Kong Enterprises” or similar, which is accurate.\n4. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: Some translations do not fully adhere to the dictionary. For example, “協調” is translated as “coordinate co-operation” or “coordinate cooperation,” which is acceptable, but “co-ordination” or “coordination” might be more precise. Also, “貸款機構” is translated as “lending institutions” or “loan parties,” which is correct.\n**Improved Translation**:\nOn the other hand, amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of enterprises are facing financial difficulties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages authorised institutions to handle situations where enterprises experience repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Practice on Handling Financial Difficulties of Hong Kong Enterprises, thereby enabling individual authorised institutions to coordinate cooperation from the perspective of the common interests of the relevant lending institutions.\n\nTable 3 Mainland Related Loan Growth\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe junior translators have produced several variations of the translation for the title \"表3 內地相關貸款增長.\" The primary elements to consider are the correct use of dictionary terms and the fluency of the English title.\n- **\"表\"** should be translated as \"Table\" (capitalized when used as a title).\n- **\"內地\"** is correctly translated as \"Mainland.\"\n- **\"相關\"** can be translated as \"related\" or \"relevant,\" both of which are appropriate in this context.\n- **\"貸款\"** should be translated as \"loans\" (plural) since it refers to a category of financial instruments, not a single loan.\n- **\"增長\"** is best translated as \"growth\" in this context, as it refers to a general trend or increase over time.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators have several issues:\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Table 3 Mainland Related Loan Growth\" – This is grammatically correct but uses \"Loan\" with a capital \"L,\" which is unnecessary in a title unless it's part of a proper noun.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Table 3 Mainland related loan growth\" – This is fluent and grammatically correct, but \"related\" is lowercase, which may be inconsistent with title case conventions.\n3. **Translation 3:** Same as Translation 1, with the same issue regarding capitalization.\n4. **Translation 4:** Same as Translation 2, with the same issue regarding lowercase \"related.\"\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Table 3 Mainland Related Loans Growth\" – This is grammatically awkward. \"Loans Growth\" is not a standard collocation; \"loan growth\" is more natural.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Table 3: Mainland-related loan growth\" – This is the most fluent and grammatically correct, using a colon and hyphen appropriately. However, the use of a colon may not be necessary in a simple title.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Table\" with a capital \"T\" as it is the beginning of the title.\n- Use \"Mainland-related\" as a compound adjective to describe the type of loan growth.\n- Use \"loan growth\" as the standard collocation.\n- Apply title case consistently, capitalizing major words.\n**Best Translation:**\n\"Table 3: Mainland-related loan growth\" is the most accurate and fluent translation, though the colon may be optional. A slightly more conventional title case would be \"Table 3 Mainland-Related Loan Growth.\" However, the use of a colon is acceptable in some style guides. Given the context, the most natural and grammatically sound translation is:\n**Final Translation:**\nTable 3 Mainland-related loan growth\n\n# Alleviate customers' funding pressures\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original phrase \"紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\" translates to \"relieve the pressure on customers' funds turnover.\" The goal is to convey that the action being discussed is aimed at reducing the financial strain that customers face in managing their cash flow.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"Relief of the client's funds turnover pressure\"** – This translation is grammatically correct but awkward in phrasing. \"Relief of\" is not a common collocation in English, and \"funds turnover pressure\" is not idiomatic.\n2. **\"Relief customer’s funding pressures.\"** – This translation is missing a verb and is grammatically incomplete. It reads like a title or a fragment rather than a full sentence.\n3. **\"Relieve the client's funds turnover pressures\"** – This is grammatically correct and uses the verb \"relieve\" appropriately. However, \"funds turnover pressures\" is still not idiomatic in English.\n4. **\"To relieve customers’ funding pressure.\"** – This is a complete sentence and uses \"relieve\" correctly. \"Funding pressure\" is more natural than \"funds turnover pressure,\" though it omits the nuance of \"turnover.\"\n5. **\"Alleviate customers' funding pressures\"** – This is a strong translation. \"Alleviate\" is a more refined synonym for \"relieve\" and is commonly used in formal contexts. \"Funding pressures\" is natural and concise.\n6. **\"Relief customer funding pressures\"** – This is incomplete and lacks a verb. It reads like a title or a fragment and is not grammatically correct.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use a strong verb like \"alleviate\" or \"relieve\" and should use \"funding pressures\" as the most natural and concise expression. The phrase \"customers' funding pressures\" is more idiomatic than \"clients' funds turnover pressures.\" Additionally, the use of \"alleviate\" adds a more formal and nuanced tone, which is appropriate for a professional context.\nThus, the best possible translation is: **\"Alleviate customers' funding pressures.\"**\n\nConsidering the impact of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the complex and volatile outlook for both the external and local economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the \"Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism,\" has extended the \"Pre-approved Interest-only Repayment\" scheme until the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme has launched and subsequently optimized certain principal repayment options to assist customers in preparing for the eventual resumption of normal repayments.\n\nAs at the end of 2022, banks approved a total of over 108,000 cases of corporate customer loan extensions and other support measures, involving an amount exceeding HK$110 billion. Regarding individual customers, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only loans without principal repayment and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount exceeding HK$65 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\nThe original text is \"# 物業按揭貸款,\" which translates to \"Property Mortgage Loans.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, with the most common being \"Property Mortgage Loans\" and \"Real estate loans.\" \nThe term \"物業\" is best translated as \"property\" or \"real estate,\" and \"按揭貸款\" is best translated as \"mortgage loans.\" The use of \"Property Mortgage Loans\" is accurate and consistent with the dictionary options provided. However, \"Real estate loans\" is also a valid translation, though it may be less specific than \"Property Mortgage Loans.\"\nThe best possible translation would be \"Property Mortgage Loans,\" as it accurately reflects the original text and uses the most appropriate terms from the dictionary.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"loan-to-value ratio\" and \"debt-to-income ratio.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the overall message is clear.\n- The use of \"countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures\" is accurate and aligns with the dictionary's \"regulation\" and \"measures\" entries.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"banking sector\" while others use \"banking system.\" The dictionary lists \"system\" as a valid translation for \"體系,\" so \"banking system\" is more consistent.\n- **\"Resilience\" vs. \"Weathered\":** The dictionary lists \"weathered\" as an option for \"抵禦,\" but \"resilience\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to describe the ability to withstand shocks.\n- **\"Debt service-to-income ratio\" vs. \"Debt-to-income ratio\":** The term \"debt-to-income ratio\" is more standard in financial literature than \"debt service-to-income ratio.\"\n- **\"Launched\" vs. \"Introduced\":** While both are acceptable, \"introduced\" is more precise when referring to the implementation of regulatory measures.\n- **\"Figure 1\" vs. \"Chart 1\":** The dictionary lists \"Chart\" as the preferred term for \"圖,\" so \"Chart 1\" is more appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"banking system\" consistently for \"銀行體系.\"\n- Use \"resilience\" for \"抵禦\" to align with financial terminology.\n- Use \"debt-to-income ratio\" as the standard term.\n- Use \"introduced\" for \"推出\" when referring to regulatory measures.\n- Use \"Chart 1\" for \"圖1.\"\n---\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures since 2009, which have strengthened banks' risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% in September 2009 before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced. The average debt-to-income ratio for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, standing at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% in August 2010 when the first cap on the ratio was introduced (Chart 1).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and fluent, with accurate use of terms like \"stress-test\" and \"basis points.\" However, \"the banking sector's mortgage business\" is slightly awkward compared to \"banks' mortgage business.\" Also, \"proper management of risks\" is less precise than \"properly managed risks.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent, with a natural flow. It correctly uses \"interest rate path\" and \"historical long-term average.\" However, \"compared to its historical long-term average\" introduces an unnecessary comparison not present in the original.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is very close to the best version. It uses \"trends in mortgage interest rates and their long-term average levels,\" which is accurate. However, \"the Authority\" should be \"the HKMA\" for consistency.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"downgraded\" for \"下調,\" which is not the best fit. \"Downgrade\" is typically used for ratings, not interest rate assumptions. Also, \"sufficiently prudent\" is a good choice for \"妥善.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is very strong. It uses \"magnitude of the interest rate increase\" for \"幅度,\" which is accurate. It also uses \"sufficiently prudent\" for \"妥善,\" which is appropriate. However, \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is accurate and fluent, with good use of \"interest rate path\" and \"long-term average level in the past.\" However, \"the banks' mortgage business\" is slightly less natural than \"banks’ mortgage business.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently.\n- Use \"downgraded\" only if it's appropriate; \"reduced\" is more accurate for \"下調.\"\n- Use \"sufficiently prudent\" for \"妥善.\"\n- Use \"interest rate path\" for \"走勢.\"\n- Use \"magnitude\" for \"幅度.\"\n- Use \"basis points\" for \"基點.\"\n- Use \"stress-test\" for \"測試.\"\n- Use \"property (as in property mortgage)\" for \"將物業.\"\n- Use \"ensured banks\" for \"確保銀行.\"\n- Use \"properly managed\" for \"妥善管理.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority reduced the magnitude of the assumed interest rate increase in the property mortgage loan stress-test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points in September. When making this decision, the Authority took into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the interest rate path and its past long-term average level. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes this level is sufficiently prudent to ensure banks’ mortgage business risks are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio of Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include issuing a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in May, which outlines the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions are expected to maintain to ensure operational resilience, as well as holding two industry dialogues to enhance the industry's understanding of the new standards and promote experience sharing within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe HKMA also provides detailed supervisory guidance on specific areas of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nIn response to continuously evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is striving to enhance the cyber defense capabilities of the banking sector by promoting banks to adopt sound triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to address supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the clearly increased risks of phishing scams and other online fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (HKBA) jointly launched a new round of large-scale promotional activities in September with the theme \"Digital KEY: Be Cautious, Think Thrice Before Clicking on a Link!\" to raise public awareness of prevention. In July, they also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to explain the latest fraudulent practices to banks.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign with the theme \"Digital KEY, Keep a Close Eye, Think Twice Before Clicking the Link!\"\n\nFigure 1 Industry Dialogue \"Embarking on a Journey Toward Operational Robustness\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn the face of further monetary tightening by major economies leading to increased market volatility, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has intensified its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA has conducted reviews to assess whether the liquidity risk management of authorized institutions is adequate, focusing on the systems and controls for diversifying funding sources and managing liquidity risk internally.

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre Status\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA has made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate use of \"significant progress\" and \"enhancing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted \"in 2022\" and \"multi-pronged approach,\" which are key elements of the original sentence.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"地位\" → \"status\" (correct), \"全球\" → \"globally\" (correct), \"金融中心\" → \"financial centre\" (correct).\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial centre in 2022.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"in 2022\" and uses \"significant progress\" and \"enhancing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted \"multi-pronged approach.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in 2022 through a multi-pronged approach to enhance Hong Kong’s position as a systemically important international financial centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"multi-pronged approach\" and \"in 2022.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"position\" instead of \"status\" and \"systemically important\" instead of \"globally competitive.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"地位\" → \"position\" (incorrect), \"具\" → \"systemically important\" (incorrect).\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented a multi-pronged approach in 2022 to enhance Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial centre, achieving significant progress.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes all key elements: \"multi-pronged approach,\" \"in 2022,\" \"enhance,\" \"status,\" and \"significant progress.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"implemented\" is slightly less natural than \"adopted\" or \"took.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA made significant progress in 2022 in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an internationally competitive global financial centre through multiple measures.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"in 2022,\" \"significant progress,\" and \"enhancing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"multiple measures\" is less precise than \"multi-pronged approach.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"全球\" → \"global\" (correct), \"地位\" → \"status\" (correct).\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA adopted a multi-pronged approach in 2022 and made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial center.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes \"multi-pronged approach,\" \"in 2022,\" \"significant progress,\" and \"enhancing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"financial center\" should be \"financial centre\" (British English spelling).  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Include all key elements: \"in 2022,\" \"multi-pronged approach,\" \"significant progress,\" \"enhancing,\" and \"status.\"\n- Use the correct dictionary terms: \"地位\" → \"status,\" \"全球\" → \"globally,\" \"金融中心\" → \"financial centre.\"\n- Maintain natural, fluent English with appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA adopted a multi-pronged approach in 2022 and made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from about 120 global financial institutions. It not only consolidated Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, but also created positive ripple effects.\n\nIn consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub, significant progress has been made across multiple areas, including optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China, as well as the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements to ensure sufficient RMB liquidity and assist in further promoting the development of offshore RMB products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of \"Swap Connect\" with the People's Bank of China and the Securities and Futures Commission; and collaborating with the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to introduce the Dual Counter Market Making mechanism, promoting the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong; and the HKMA launching a multi-year plan to further optimize financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Benefiting from sufficient RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between the Mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for Mainland capital entering international markets and for international investors investing in the rapidly growing Mainland market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"green\" for \"綠色\", \"system\" for \"體系\", \"bond issuance\" for \"債券發行\", and \"robust\" for \"穩健\". However, some translations use \"Platform\" with a capital \"P\" without clear justification, which may be unnecessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some have minor grammatical issues. For example, \"strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial Platform\" (Translation 2) has an unnecessary capital \"P\" and is slightly awkward. Similarly, \"everyone can recognise\" (Translation 3) is less formal than \"helping them understand\" (Translation 4 and 5), which is more natural in this context.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The phrase \"intensified its market promotion efforts\" (Translation 1, 4, 5, 6) is more precise than \"enhanced market promotional work\" (Translation 2) or \"strengthened its market promotion work\" (Translation 3). \"Helping them understand\" (Translation 4, 5, 6) is more natural than \"raising awareness of\" (Translation 1) or \"allowing them to understand\" (Translation 2).\n4. **Consistency and Style**: The translations vary slightly in style, with some using \"also made good progress\" and others using \"also achieved good progress.\" The former is more commonly used in formal writing and is more natural.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and fluency of the best elements from the junior translations while ensuring consistency in terminology and natural phrasing.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, as well as green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts towards overseas and Mainland stakeholders, helping them understand Hong Kong's robust financial system and the prospects it brings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting the more widespread adoption of financial technology across the financial industry to further consolidate Hong Kong's status as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System \"FPS\" continues to grow steadily, with the number of registrations surpassing 10 million in March, and the average daily transaction volume also exceeding 1 million cases in September.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory bodies, making contributions to the global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"Budget\" correctly from the dictionary. The term \"financial community\" is appropriate for \"金融界.\" However, \"leading figures\" is slightly generic compared to \"weighty guests\" or \"heavyweight guests\" used in other translations.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"initiatives\" instead of \"plans,\" which is a valid alternative. The phrase \"senior participants\" is slightly less impactful than \"heavyweight guests\" or \"distinguished guests.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"proactively\" and \"financial center\" correctly. It uses \"unique insights\" and \"high-profile guests,\" which are more engaging than \"unique perspectives\" or \"distinguished guests.\" However, it omits the abbreviation \"HKMA\" in the first sentence, which may be less formal than the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and uses \"heavyweight guests\" and \"financial sector\" correctly. However, it uses \"under various uncertain factors\" instead of \"amid various uncertainties,\" which is slightly less idiomatic. It also uses \"activity\" instead of \"event,\" which is less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"heavyweight guests\" and \"financial sector\" correctly. However, it uses \"‘2022-23 Budget’\" with single quotation marks, which is inconsistent with the original's use of double quotation marks.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"key figures\" instead of \"heavyweight guests,\" which is slightly less impactful. It also uses \"global financial sector\" instead of \"global financial community,\" which is a valid alternative but slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as an abbreviation.\n- Use \"heavyweight guests\" for \"重量級嘉賓\" to convey the significance of the attendees.\n- Use \"amid various uncertainties\" for \"在各項不確定因素下\" to maintain fluency.\n- Use \"financial community\" for \"金融界\" to align with the dictionary.\n- Use \"event\" for \"活動\" as it is more precise than \"activity.\"\n- Use \"global financial community\" for \"全球金融界\" to maintain consistency with the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, the HKMA held the \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" to implement the plans announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the international financial sector to share their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amid various uncertainties. The event received a tremendous response, attracting over 200 heavyweight guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully reflecting the global financial community’s support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong further consolidated its status as an offshore renminbi hub, with offshore renminbi business experiencing robust growth during the year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between Mainland China and international financial markets. The interconnection mechanism between Hong Kong and Mainland China is widely recognized as the preferred channel for international investors to access onshore capital markets and for Mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, the turnover of Bond Connect’s “Northbound Trading” accounted for 61% of the total turnover of foreign investors in China’s interbank bond market. Bond Connect’s “Southbound Trading” and “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect” have operated smoothly since their launch in 2021. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of “Swap Connect,” further extending financial cooperation between Hong Kong and Mainland China to the derivatives market, and strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a major offshore renminbi business hub and risk management center. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized in July, marking another important milestone in strengthening Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nTo provide more diverse RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in Hong Kong’s stock market. The working group has commenced preparations, including the launch of the Dual Counter Market Making mechanism, to optimize the trading mechanism for dual counter stocks in Hong Kong dollars and RMB.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some are more fluent than others. For example, the third and fourth translations use smoother sentence structures and avoid redundancy. The first and second translations occasionally use repetitive phrasing, such as \"to increase Hong Kong's appeal\" and \"create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment.\"\n2. **Vocabulary and Style**: The use of \"strive to enhance\" is consistent across translations, but \"strive to enhance\" is slightly more formal than \"strives to enhance,\" which is more natural in English. The term \"platform\" is capitalized in some translations, which may be unnecessary unless referring to a specific entity. The word \"convenient\" is used in several translations, but \"favorable\" or \"conducive\" might be more appropriate in the context of a regulatory environment.\n3. **Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"status\" for \"地位,\" \"tax\" for \"稅務,\" and \"hub\" for \"樞紐.\" However, some translations use \"position\" or \"role\" for \"地位,\" which are also acceptable but less precise than \"status\" in this context.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, using terms like \"Mainland\" and \"overseas\" correctly. The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent, though some translations use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n5. **Consistency and Precision**: The third and fourth translations are the most consistent in tone and structure. They use \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"progress\" for \"進展,\" which are the most natural choices. The use of \"intensifies market promotion\" is more precise than \"strengthens market promotion.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA works closely with the Government and the financial sector to foster a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Meanwhile, the HKMA intensifies market promotion, introducing Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with banking departments to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s status as an Asian fintech hub. Key measures implemented during the year include:\n- Promoting the application of compliance technology and conducting assessments of fintech applications;\n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency at the wholesale level, striving to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of central bank digital currency at the retail level (i.e., \"digital HKD\" or e-HKD);\n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Exchange\";\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging resource policies to support the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting broader adoption of the fast payment system \"FPS (Faster Payment System).\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and concepts, such as \"financial infrastructure,\" \"RTGS systems,\" \"CMU,\" and \"Bond Connect.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"settlement services,\" \"system availability rate,\" and \"outstanding bonds.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly includes \"2\" in the sentence \"achieved a system availability rate of 100% 2,\" which is a direct copy error from the original text and should be omitted.\n- **Translation 3** mislabels the CMU as the \"Central Money Markets Unit,\" which is not an accurate or commonly used term; the correct term is \"Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments (CMU).\"\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly converts \"12,075億港元\" to \"HK$1,207.5 billion\" instead of \"HK$12,075 billion,\" which is a critical numerical error.\n- **Translation 6** also misrepresents the amount of \"12,075億港元\" as \"HK$1,207.5 billion,\" which is incorrect.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Northbound Trading\" and \"Southbound Trading\" instead of \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound,\" which is less concise and slightly less standard.\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 6** use \"consolidating\" and \"maintaining\" respectively for \"鞏固,\" which are both acceptable, but \"consolidating\" may be more precise in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct numerical values as per the original text.\n- Employ the most accurate and standard financial terminology.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n- Adhere strictly to the dictionary guidelines, particularly for terms like \"CMU,\" \"Bond Connect,\" and \"outstanding EFBNs.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while correcting the numerical and terminology errors.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is key to consolidating Hong Kong's status as a major international financial centre. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS systems) processing interbank transactions, the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. The settlement services for Bond Connect's Northbound and Southbound channels remained smooth. At year-end, the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds held in the CMU system amounted to HK$12,075 billion, while the total amount of outstanding other bonds increased to HK$15,733 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\n“轉數快”使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\nThe adoption of \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) continued to grow in 2022. As at the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registrations, with the daily average transaction volume rising by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to the steady growth in person-to-person payments and commercial payments, the sustained increase in using FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up stored value payment tools such as electronic money wallets or bank accounts is the key reason for the significant growth in FPS transaction volume.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) monitors six designated retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance) and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks). During the year, the HKMA continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Consumption Voucher Scheme by coordinating and promoting communication and cooperation between the relevant government departments and the licensed stored value facilities appointed for the scheme.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"stable and agile manner\" instead of \"risk-based and agile,\" which misrepresents the original term \"風險為本\" (risk-based). Also, \"next step’s work\" is awkward phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Correctly uses \"risk-based and flexible approach\" and \"next steps.\" However, \"flexible\" is not in the dictionary; \"agile\" is the correct term. Also, \"main regulatory requirements\" is acceptable, but \"key\" is more precise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"agile\" correctly and \"next steps for work\" is slightly awkward but understandable. The structure is clear and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"agile and risk-based manner\" and \"elaborates on\" for \"闡述,\" which is appropriate. However, \"crypto assets\" should be \"crypto-assets\" with a hyphen as per the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"risk-based and agile manner\" and \"elaborates on\" for \"闡述.\" The structure is clear, but \"the next steps of work\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"risk-based and agile manner\" and \"sets out\" for \"闡述,\" which is appropriate. \"Next steps for work\" is slightly awkward but acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"風險為本\" should be translated as \"risk-based,\" not \"flexible.\"\n- \"靈活\" should be \"agile.\"\n- \"加密資產\" should be \"crypto-assets\" with a hyphen.\n- \"闡述\" should be translated as \"sets out\" or \"outlines.\"\n- \"下一步的工作\" should be \"next steps\" without \"for work\" to maintain fluency.\n- \"HKMA\" should be used consistently, and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" should be spelled out on first mention.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published a summary in January 2023 of the discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, summarizing the views collected on the discussion paper and the HKMA's response. The summary document confirms that the HKMA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and agile manner, and sets out the expected scope of regulation, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking sector affairs, assuming leadership roles in multiple regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has served as chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP) for three consecutive terms. In addition, the HKMA serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as co-chair of the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board. It also leads the group under the Financial Stability Board responsible for monitoring the progress and follow-up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate, but there are a few nuances to consider for optimal fluency and correctness. \nFirst, the use of the apostrophe in \"Leaders’\" is appropriate when indicating possession, as in \"Leaders’ Investment Summit,\" which correctly implies that the summit is organized by or for the leaders. However, the first junior translator used \"Leaders’\" without an apostrophe, which is incorrect. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth translators all used \"Leaders’\" correctly.\nNext, the term \"投資峰\" is translated as \"Investment Summit\" in all translations, which is accurate and aligns with the dictionary entry. The term \"會\" is translated as \"Summit\" in all cases, which is appropriate given the context of a major event. However, the dictionary provides several alternatives for \"會,\" such as \"meeting,\" \"seminar,\" or \"committee,\" but \"Summit\" is the most fitting in this context.\nThe term \"國際\" is translated as \"International\" in all translations, which is correct and aligns with the dictionary entry. The use of \"International\" at the beginning of the title is standard and appropriate.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" is consistent across all translations, which is acceptable for the format of the title.\nIn terms of fluency and naturalness, all translations are very similar, with only minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. The most natural and grammatically correct version is \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit,\" which correctly uses the possessive form and capitalizes the title appropriately.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is:\nInternational Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit will be held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the \"2022–23 Budget,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held the \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" in November. The three-day summit received a warm response, bringing together 26 leading figures from the financial industry to share unique insights and perspectives on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instability factors, as well as how to seize the opportunities within these challenges. The summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their group chairmen or chief executives attending in person. The participating institutions included some of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit issued a clear message to the global community, indicating that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations; global financial leaders can experience firsthand Hong Kong's unique resilience and vitality and understand the opportunities Hong Kong can provide in the development of Asia's business.\n\n# Hong Kong as a key gateway to the Mainland and a global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nHong Kong strives to consolidate its status as a global offshore renminbi business hub, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with Mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. During the year, renminbi business, including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance, continued to record robust growth. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding the interconnection mechanism. The results of the triennial survey on foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover conducted by the Bank for International Settlements in 2022 once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as a renminbi foreign exchange centre.\n\nBond Connect’s “Northbound” continues to be the key channel for international investors to access the Mainland bond market through Hong Kong’s market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily turnover of Bond Connect’s “Northbound” reached 32.2 billion RMB (an increase of 25% compared to 2021), accounting for 61% of the total turnover by foreign investors in China’s interbank bond market.\n\nBond Connect “Northbound Trading” launched technical optimization measures in July, including digitizing the process for investors to participate in the issuance of domestic bonds in the primary market and reducing service fees. These market-based optimization measures enhance the operational efficiency of Bond Connect “Northbound Trading” and also lower investors' transaction costs.\n\nTo improve the translation of the original text, a critical review of the junior translators' work reveals several key areas for refinement. All translations capture the general meaning and structure of the original text, but differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines are evident.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the term \"Swap Connect\" as the English equivalent of 「互換通」.\n- The term 「地位」 is consistently translated as \"status\" or \"position,\" which aligns with the dictionary options.\n- The term 「風險管理工具」 is translated as \"risk management tools,\" which is accurate.\n- The term 「離岸國債期貨」 is translated as \"offshore government bond futures,\" which is correct.\n- The term 「香港」 is translated as \"Hong Kong\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is appropriate.\n- The term 「互聯互通」 is translated as \"interconnection\" or \"mutual connectivity,\" which is acceptable.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Northbound Trading\" with capitalization that is inconsistent with the original text, which uses lowercase.\n- The term 「債券」 is translated as \"bonds\" or \"bond market,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"bond market\" inappropriately in contexts where \"bonds\" is more suitable.\n- The term 「基礎設施機構」 is translated as \"infrastructure institutions,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"infrastructure institutions\" inconsistently.\n- The term 「互換」 is translated as \"Swap,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"Swap\" inconsistently with capitalization.\n- The term 「市場」 is translated as \"market\" or \"markets,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"bond market\" inappropriately in contexts where \"market\" is more suitable.\n- The term 「交易」 is translated as \"trading\" or \"transaction,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"trading\" inconsistently.\n- The term 「籌備」 is translated as \"preparation\" or \"preparatory work,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"preparation work\" inconsistently.\n- The term 「推進」 is translated as \"advance\" or \"push ahead with,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"advance\" inconsistently.\n- The term 「進一步」 is translated as \"further,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"further\" inconsistently.\n- The term 「支持」 is translated as \"support,\" which is correct, but some translations use \"supporting\" or \"support\" inconsistently.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of terms like \"Swap Connect\" and \"Northbound Trading.\"\n- Use \"bonds\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"bond market.\"\n- Use \"infrastructure institutions\" consistently where appropriate.\n- Use \"Swap\" consistently with lowercase unless it is part of a proper noun.\n- Use \"market\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"bond market.\"\n- Use \"trading\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"transaction.\"\n- Use \"preparation\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"preparation work.\"\n- Use \"advance\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"push ahead with.\"\n- Use \"further\" consistently where appropriate.\n- Use \"support\" consistently where appropriate, rather than \"supporting.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be one that maintains consistency in terminology, adheres to the dictionary guidelines, and ensures fluency and natural English expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nTo enhance the supporting arrangements for the \"Northbound\" segment of the Bond Connect and to facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in Mainland China's bond market, Hong Kong and Mainland China announced in July the initiation of a cooperation plan to interconnect their interest rate swap markets (the \"Swap Connect\"). Initially, the Swap Connect will first launch northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade Mainland China's interest rate swap products through connections between Hong Kong and Mainland China's infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management center. The preparation work for the Swap Connect is progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching northbound trading as soon as possible. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore more diversified risk management tools, including the launch of offshore government bond futures, to further support international investors in investing in Mainland China's bond market.\n\nSince the launch of Bond Connect “Southbound” in 2021, the market response has been positive, with smooth operations and transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and priced in various currencies. “Southbound” has promoted the development of the offshore renminbi market, particularly the significant growth in the issuance of renminbi-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with relevant mainland authorities to study ways to optimize Bond Connect “Southbound” and promote the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1

Reserves Management\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"exceptionally volatile\" for \"異常動盪.\"\n- The term \"negative returns\" is consistently used for \"負回報.\"\n- The phrase \"diversified long-term asset allocation\" is well-represented in several translations.\n- The term \"market storms\" is used effectively to translate \"風暴.\"\n- The term \"Exchange Fund\" is used appropriately in most translations, with \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" being a slightly more literal but less common term.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"multi-asset funds\" instead of \"diversified asset funds,\" which may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"多元資產基金.\"\n- The term \"defensive positioning\" is used in some translations, but \"defensive deployment\" or \"defensive measures\" may be more appropriate based on the context.\n- The phrase \"latest developments in the external environment\" is used in some translations, but \"latest changes in the external environment\" may be more accurate for \"最新局勢變化.\"\n- Some translations use \"recorded a negative investment return rate of 4.5%\" instead of \"recorded an investment return rate of -4.5%,\" which is more standard in financial contexts.\n- The term \"mitigating the impact\" is used in some translations, but \"reducing the impact\" is more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"diversified asset funds\" to accurately reflect \"多元資產基金.\"\n- The term \"defensive measures\" is more natural than \"defensive positioning\" or \"defensive deployment.\"\n- The phrase \"latest changes in the external environment\" is more accurate for \"最新局勢變化.\"\n- The standard financial phrasing \"an investment return rate of -4.5%\" should be used instead of \"a negative investment return rate of 4.5%.\"\n- The phrase \"reducing the impact\" is more natural than \"mitigating the impact\" in this context.\nBased on this review and reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices of various asset classes falling simultaneously, undermining the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could provide a risk-mitigating effect. It also became the only instance in nearly half a century where stocks, bonds, and major non-dollar currencies recorded negative returns in the same year. Under such a harsh investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment return rate of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the situation where most diversified asset funds suffered significant losses during the year, the Exchange Fund's performance reflected the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's long-term diversified asset allocation, as well as its defensive measures and strategic adjustments made in response to the latest changes in the external environment, effectively reducing the impact of market storms.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n# 外匯基金\nThe term \"外匯基金\" is a compound noun consisting of \"外匯\" (foreign exchange) and \"基金\" (fund). According to the dictionary provided, \"外匯\" can be translated as \"foreign exchange,\" \"Foreign Exchange,\" or \"Exchange Fund,\" while \"基金\" can be translated as \"funds,\" \"Fund,\" or \"Exchange Fund.\" \nThe translations provided by the junior translators all attempt to capture the meaning of \"外匯基金.\" However, they vary in their use of capitalization and punctuation. For instance, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and \"Exchange Fund\" are both valid translations, but \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is more precise and commonly used in financial contexts. Additionally, the use of the hash symbol (#) in some translations is unnecessary and does not appear in the original text.\nConsidering the dictionary options and the need for a natural, fluent English translation, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is the most appropriate and accurate translation of \"外匯基金.\" It uses the capitalized form \"Foreign Exchange\" for \"外匯\" and \"Fund\" for \"基金,\" which aligns with the dictionary's suggestions and is consistent with standard financial terminology.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the delegated authority.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly clear but has grammatical issues, such as \"protection\" as a standalone item (should be \"protection of capital\") and \"strive to achieve investment return\" (should be \"returns\"). Also, \"Exchange Fund\" is used inconsistently with \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is more polished and grammatically correct. It uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" consistently and includes \"US dollar assets\" as per the dictionary. However, \"maximize investment returns\" may be too strong compared to the original's \"as much as possible.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"Ensure capital protection\" and \"liquidity is sufficient,\" which are accurate. However, \"in order to ensure\" in (iv) is slightly wordy compared to the original's nuance.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The translation is clear but uses \"backed\" instead of \"supported\" for \"支持,\" which is not the best match. Also, \"to the fullest extent possible\" is more verbose than the original's \"as much as possible.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is a strong translation with correct grammar and structure. It uses \"To protect capital\" and \"sufficient liquidity is available,\" which are accurate. However, \"strive as much as possible for investment returns\" is slightly awkward compared to \"strive to achieve investment returns.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most concise and fluent translation. It uses \"U.S. dollar assets\" and \"Seek to maximize investment returns,\" which are appropriate. However, \"Seek to maximize\" may be more aggressive than the original's \"as much as possible.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"外匯基金\" should be translated as \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"諮詢委員會\" is correctly translated as \"Advisory Committee.\"\n- \"穩定\" should be translated as \"stability\" or \"maintaining... stability\" depending on context.\n- \"支持\" should be \"supported\" or \"backed,\" but \"supported\" is more natural in this context.\n- \"確保\" is best translated as \"ensure\" or \"safeguard.\"\n- \"維持\" is best as \"maintain.\"\n- \"購買力\" is \"purchasing power.\"\n- \"符合\" is best as \"comply with\" or \"in line with.\"\n- \"長期\" is \"long-term.\"\n- \"項\" is best as \"items\" or \"item(s).\"\n- \"制定\" is best as \"formulates\" or \"formulate.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:\n(i) To protect capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) To strive as much as possible to achieve investment returns, in compliance with the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Foreign Exchange Fund.\n\nThe above translations generally capture the core meaning of the original text, but there are notable differences in fluency, word choice, and adherence to the dictionary. Here's a critical review:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"consider\" and \"Exchange Fund\" consistently. It adheres to the dictionary by using \"statutory\" and \"Figure 1.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with \"take into account\" instead of \"consider.\" Both are acceptable, but \"consider\" is slightly more concise.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"foreign exchange fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is less precise and not the preferred term from the dictionary. It also uses \"comprehensively consider,\" which is slightly wordy.\n4. **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"are subject to\" for \"顧及,\" which changes the meaning from \"consider\" to \"are under the influence of.\" This is a significant deviation from the original.\n5. **Translation 5** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with \"take into account\" instead of \"consider.\" It is still fluent and accurate.\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"subject to considerations of,\" which is not an accurate translation of \"顧及.\" It also uses possessive forms like \"Exchange Fund’s\" which are acceptable but not necessary for clarity.\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"consider\" or \"take into account\" for \"顧及,\" both are acceptable but \"consider\" is more concise.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"statutory\" for \"法定.\"\n- Use \"Figure 1\" as per the dictionary.\n- Avoid unnecessary possessive forms unless they enhance clarity.\n**Best possible translation:**\nThe above objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a title: “圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別.” The goal is to translate it into a clear, natural English title that accurately reflects the content.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Figure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Figure 1,\" proper use of possessive (\"Exchange Fund’s\"), and accurate translation of \"投資組合類別\" as \"investment portfolio categories.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Categories\" is plural, but \"類別\" can be singular or plural depending on context. However, in a title, plural is acceptable.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Figure 1: Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio Categories\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Figure 1\" and \"Exchange Fund's.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Investment Portfolio Categories\" is awkwardly capitalized and lacks a preposition. It reads more like a list than a title.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Figure 1 Investment Portfolio Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is a direct translation of \"外匯基金.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is awkward and lacks a preposition between \"Figure 1\" and the rest of the title.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Figure 1 Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio Category\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund's\" and \"Investment Portfolio Category.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Category\" is singular, which may not match the plural \"類別\" unless the context is singular, which is unlikely in a title.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Figure 1 Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio Categories\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Figure 1,\" \"Foreign Exchange Fund's,\" and \"Investment Portfolio Categories.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is a direct translation, but \"Exchange Fund\" is also acceptable and more concise.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Figure 1 Exchange Fund’s investment portfolio categories\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"Figure 1,\" \"Exchange Fund’s,\" and \"investment portfolio categories.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title is lowercase, which is not standard for titles.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Figure 1\" as the standard format.\n- Choose between \"Exchange Fund\" or \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" based on context. Since \"外匯基金\" is a proper noun referring to a specific entity, \"Exchange Fund\" is more concise and commonly used in financial contexts.\n- Use \"investment portfolio categories\" to reflect the plural nature of \"類別.\"\n- Ensure proper capitalization and punctuation.\nThus, the most natural and accurate translation is:  \n**Figure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio.**\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to safeguard the value of assets and ensure their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and improve long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has adopted a prudent and incremental approach to allocate part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and stocks, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and stocks are held by investment portfolios, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation for the long-term growth portfolio, along with allocations for other asset classes, is formulated based on prudent risk management principles and diversification strategies for asset portfolios.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Government for strategic purposes in the Exchange Fund accounts. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is generally accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Future Fund\" as per the dictionary. However, \"major individual example\" is slightly awkward; \"key example\" might be more natural. The use of \"portfolio composition\" is appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"statutory bodies\" and \"portfolio weightings\" accurately. The structure is clear and fluent. The only minor issue is the use of \"were\" in \"were approximately 35:65 in 2022\" – \"was\" might be more appropriate since the proportion is a single fact.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent but has some inconsistencies. It uses \"Fiscal Reserves\" with a capital \"F,\" which may not be necessary unless it's a proper noun. The phrase \"between the portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio\" is slightly awkward; \"in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio\" is more natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"portfolio mix\" and \"proportion\" appropriately. The structure is clear, and the use of \"determined by the portfolio mix\" is natural. The only minor issue is the use of \"return\" instead of \"returns\" in \"the return of the investment portfolio,\" which should be plural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second one and is also accurate. It uses \"weightings of the portfolios\" and \"were approximately 35:65 in 2022.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"were\" instead of \"was\" for the proportion.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"financial reserves\" instead of \"fiscal reserves,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary. However, \"financial reserves\" is still acceptable. The phrase \"key example\" is natural, and the structure is clear.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Future Fund\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"fiscal reserves\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"statutory bodies\" for \"法定組織.\"\n- Use \"interest rate\" and \"portfolio weightings\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"was approximately 35:65 in 2022\" for grammatical correctness.\n- Ensure that \"returns\" is used in plural form when referring to investment returns.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, but the Future Fund is a key example. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the returns of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio weightings. In 2022, the proportion of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is generally accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Strategic\" and \"tactical\" for the respective terms. However, it uses \"tactical deviations\" instead of \"strategic deviation\" as per the dictionary, which is a critical error. It also uses \"tracking error limits\" correctly.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" appropriately, and correctly identifies \"strategic deviation.\" It also uses \"permissible tracking error limits\" and \"strategic deviation\" accurately. The only minor issue is the use of \"tactical asset allocation\" in the sentence about the HKMA, which should be \"strategic.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation has a major error in using \"Strategic\" and \"strategic\" inconsistently. It also incorrectly uses \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation\" in the first instance, and later uses \"strategic deviation\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"tracks error limits\" instead of \"tracking error limits.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" and identifies \"strategic deviation\" correctly. It also uses \"tracking error limits\" and \"strategic deviation\" appropriately. The only minor issue is the use of \"both strategic and tactical\" instead of \"respectively.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This is a strong translation. It correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" and identifies \"strategic deviation\" correctly. It also uses \"tracking error limit\" and \"strategic deviation\" appropriately. The only minor issue is the use of \"investment portfolio managers\" instead of \"portfolio managers.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" and identifies \"strategic deviation\" correctly. It also uses \"tracking error limits\" and \"strategic deviation\" appropriately. The only minor issue is the use of \"tactical asset allocation\" in the sentence about the HKMA, which should be \"strategic.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" consistently, correctly identify \"strategic deviation\" as per the dictionary, and use \"tracking error limits\" and \"strategic deviation\" appropriately. It should also be fluent and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based respectively on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the form of an investment benchmark, meaning the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline, and through tactical asset allocation, it aims to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e., strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, formulates the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of strategic deviation to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office’s staff are responsible for directly managing about 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolios. This internally managed portion of the investment portfolios includes investments in different global fixed-rate markets, and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Managers\nThe original text is \"# 外聘投資經理\", which translates to \"External Investment Managers\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The translations by the junior translators vary in accuracy and fluency. The first, sixth, and fifth translations are the most accurate, using \"External Investment Managers\" or \"External Investment Manager\" with appropriate capitalization. However, the first and sixth translations are more consistent with the original text's structure and meaning. The fourth translation, \"External investors,\" is incorrect as it misrepresents \"經理\" as \"investors\" instead of \"managers.\" The second and third translations are similar but use a hashtag, which may not be necessary unless the original text's formatting is to be preserved. The best translation should be \"External Investment Managers\" to accurately reflect the original text's meaning and structure.\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to obtain sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to draw on market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"depository service fees\" for \"託管費\" and \"withholding taxes\" for \"預扣稅\". However, \"are primarily affected by market factors and vary each year\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"depository fees\" for \"託管費\", which is acceptable, though \"depository service fees\" might be more precise. The phrase \"vary each year primarily due to market factors\" is slightly awkward in flow.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"custody fees\" for \"託管費\", which is a valid alternative. The phrase \"vary from year to year and are mainly affected by market factors\" is well-structured and natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but \"withholding tax\" should be plural \"withholding taxes\" to match the original. Also, \"yearly\" is less common than \"each year\" or \"annually\" in formal writing.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very good. It uses \"hiring\" instead of \"employing\", which is a minor stylistic choice. It also uses \"depository fees\" for \"託管費\", which is acceptable. The phrase \"are mainly affected by market factors and vary each year\" is natural and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"depository fees\" for \"託管費\" and \"influenced\" for \"影響\", which is appropriate. The phrase \"vary annually\" is slightly more formal than \"vary each year\", but still correct.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- \"Employing\" is more formal and appropriate than \"hiring\" in this context.\n- \"Depository service fees\" is more precise than \"depository fees\" for \"託管費\".\n- \"Withholding taxes\" should be plural to match the original.\n- \"Primarily affected by market factors\" is more natural than \"mainly affected\" or \"influenced\".\n- \"Vary each year\" is more natural than \"vary annually\" or \"vary from year to year\".\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use \"employing\", \"depository service fees\", \"withholding taxes\", and \"primarily affected by market factors and vary each year\".\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe relevant expenditure for employing external investment managers includes fund management and depository service fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenditures are primarily affected by market factors and vary each year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"lines of defence\" for \"防線\" and \"risk management process\" for \"管理程序.\"\n- The term \"strategic planning\" is consistently used for \"策略性規劃,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"Exchange Fund\" is used for \"基金\" in several translations, which is contextually accurate given the reference to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n- The translations all capture the idea of \"three lines of defence\" and \"robust framework\" effectively.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" inconsistently, switching between \"HKMA\" and the full name, which affects fluency.\n- The term \"operational risks\" is more accurate than \"business operation risks\" for \"業務操作風險.\"\n- The phrase \"the establishment of the risk management process\" is repetitive and can be streamlined.\n- Some translations use \"diversified investments\" instead of \"diversified investment,\" which is less precise.\n- The term \"major categories\" is used in one translation for \"主要投資風險類別,\" but \"key categories\" is more natural in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for \"金管局.\"\n- Use \"operational risks\" for \"業務操作風險.\"\n- Use \"key categories\" for \"主要投資風險類別.\"\n- Use \"diversified investment\" instead of \"diversified investments\" for consistency with \"多元化投資.\"\n- Streamline the phrase \"the establishment of the risk management process\" to \"the risk management process.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, and the importance of risk management is self-evident. The HKMA has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has established three lines of defence for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors key categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks), and the risk management process provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terms like \"ESG-related risks\" and \"risk-adjusted long-term returns.\" It correctly uses \"the Exchange Fund\" and \"2022 Sustainable Development Report.\" However, it omits the \"Annual\" in \"Annual Sustainability Report,\" which may be important for clarity.\n**Translation 2** incorrectly translates \"社會\" as \"the community\" instead of \"social,\" which is a key term in ESG. It also uses \"the community, and governance\" instead of \"environment, social, and governance,\" which is a standard ESG acronym. This is a significant error in terminology.\n**Translation 3** is well-structured and accurate, using \"environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\" correctly. It also uses \"risk-adjusted long-term returns\" and \"public and private markets\" appropriately. However, it adds \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in full, which is not necessary if \"HKMA\" has been used consistently.\n**Translation 4** is very close to the best version, with correct ESG terminology and proper use of \"risk-adjusted long-term returns.\" It also includes \"Annual\" in \"Annual Sustainability Report,\" which adds clarity. However, it uses \"already integrated\" instead of \"has integrated,\" which is slightly less natural.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and concise, using \"risk-adjusted long-term returns\" and \"public and private markets\" correctly. It also uses \"2022 Sustainability Report\" without \"Annual,\" which is acceptable but slightly less specific than \"Annual Sustainability Report.\"\n**Translation 6** has several issues: it uses \"moderately\" instead of \"appropriately,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also incorrectly translates \"社會\" as \"the community\" and uses \"integrating\" instead of \"integrated.\" Additionally, it adds \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" in full unnecessarily.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently, use the correct ESG terminology, and ensure that all dictionary terms are translated accurately. It should also be fluent and natural in English, avoiding unnecessary additions or omissions.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks involved in investment activities. When ESG investments have comparable risk-adjusted long-term returns to other investment projects, the HKMA generally prioritizes ESG investments according to established guiding principles and has integrated ESG factors into the investment management processes of the Exchange Fund's public and private markets. Details regarding the HKMA's responsible investment framework and its implementation can be found in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund's Performance\n\n# The financial markets in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced exceptional volatility, with bond markets and equity markets declining by 16.2% and 19.8%, respectively, representing a significant drop.\n\nDue to global inflation soaring, tightening monetary policies and slowing economic growth, key stock market indices fell sharply during the year. While global equity markets edged up at the end of the year amid expectations of peaking inflation and interest rates, the US S&P 500 Index still declined 19.4%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index fell 15.5% during the year.\nAffected by the sharp rise in global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices fell sharply during the year. Although global stock markets experienced a slight rebound at year-end due to expectations of inflation and interest rates peaking, the US Standard & Poor's 500 index still declined 19.4% during the year, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 15.5%.\nAffected by the surge in global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices sharply declined during the year. Despite a slight rebound in global stock markets toward the end of the year due to expectations of inflation and interest rates peaking, the US S&P 500 Index fell by 19.4%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index declined by 15.5% during the year.\nSubject to global inflation surging, tight monetary policy, and slowing economic growth, major stock indices fell sharply during the year. Despite global stock markets rebounding slightly at the end of the year due to expectations of inflation and interest rates peaking, the US Standard & Poor's 500 Index still fell by 19.4%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell by 15.5%.\nIs subject to global inflation soaring, due to... tightening monetary policies, and economic growth slowing, stock market indices sharply fell during the year. While equity markets edged up at year-end due to the appearance of inflation and interest rate Summit expectations, the US S&P 500 index still fell 19.4%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index fell 15.5%.\nDue to global inflation surging, tight monetary policy, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices fell sharply during the year. Although global stock markets slightly rebounded at the end of the year on expectations of inflation and interest rate peaks, the S&P 500 index in the US still fell by 19.4%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong declined by 15.5%.\nThe translations vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary. The first, third, fifth, and sixth translations are the most fluent and accurate. The second translation has grammatical errors and uses \"Summit\" incorrectly for \"peak.\" The fourth translation uses \"Standard & Poor's\" instead of \"S&P,\" which is less concise.\nThe best translation should use \"S&P\" for brevity, \"fell\" or \"declined\" for \"下跌,\" and \"during the year\" for \"年內.\" It should also use \"global\" consistently for \"全球\" and \"環球,\" and \"economic growth\" for \"經濟增長.\"\nAffected by the surge in global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices sharply declined during the year. Although global stock markets experienced a slight rebound at year-end due to expectations of inflation and interest rates peaking, the US S&P 500 Index still fell by 19.4%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index declined by 15.5% during the year.\n\nDue to central banks aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, major market government bond yields have continued to surge. The US 10-year Treasury yield rose from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022, climbing all the way to above 4% by the fourth quarter, reaching the highest level since 2008. The US Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, with the magnitude of the inversion continuously expanding, deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the monetary market, the US dollar sharply strengthened in 2022 under the drive of consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and the renminbi, experienced significant depreciation against the US dollar, with the British pound and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively against the US dollar.\nIn the monetary market, the US dollar sharply strengthened in 2022 under the drive of consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and the renminbi, experienced significant depreciation against the US dollar, with the British pound and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% respectively against the US dollar.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of key currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1 2022 Market Returns\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund's Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is fluent and accurate in most parts, but it incorrectly translates \"2,054億港元\" as \"HK$205.4 billion\" instead of \"HK$2,054 billion.\" It also uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" inconsistently, switching to \"Exchange Fund\" in later parts. The term \"downward adjustment\" is appropriate for \"下調.\"\n**Translation 2** is accurate and fluent, using \"Exchange Fund\" consistently and translating \"下調\" as \"adjustment.\" However, it uses \"valuation adjustment\" for \"估值下調,\" which is slightly less precise than \"valuation decline\" or \"negative currency translation effect\" from the dictionary.\n**Translation 3** is similar to Translation 2 but uses \"foreign exchange valuation decline\" for \"估值下調,\" which is more precise. However, it uses \"held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund's investment holding company\" instead of \"held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund's investment holding companies,\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Translation 4** is the most literal, using \"HK$2,054 billion\" correctly. However, it uses \"loss from foreign exchange valuation of non-HKD assets\" instead of \"valuation decline\" or \"negative currency translation effect,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"investment subsidiaries\" instead of \"investment holding subsidiaries.\"\n**Translation 5** uses \"negative in investment returns\" and \"negative in equities,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic in financial contexts. It also uses \"controlling subsidiaries\" instead of \"investment holding subsidiaries,\" which is not the best match from the dictionary.\n**Translation 6** incorrectly translates \"2,054億港元\" as \"HK$2,054 billion\" but then uses \"valuation downgrade\" for \"估值下調,\" which is not the best match. It also uses \"non-Hong Kong assets\" instead of \"non-HKD assets,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HK$2,054 billion\" for \"2,054億港元.\"\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" consistently.\n- Use \"valuation decline\" or \"negative currency translation effect\" for \"估值下調.\"\n- Use \"investment holding subsidiaries\" for \"投資控股附屬公司.\"\n- Use \"equity investment\" or \"equities\" for \"股票投資.\"\n- Use \"bond investment\" or \"bonds\" for \"債券投資.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most appropriate English alternatives.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$2,054 billion in 2022, including a bond investment loss of HK$532 billion, an equity investment loss of HK$805 billion (which included a loss of HK$610 billion from foreign equity investments and a loss of HK$195 billion from Hong Kong equity investments), a valuation decline of HK$40 billion for non-HKD assets, and a loss of HK$317 billion from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund's investment holding companies. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$8.7 billion.\n\nAt year-end 2022, the Exchange Fund's total assets amounted to HK$400.8 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$48.47 billion, of which private equity amounted to HK$37 billion and real estate amounted to HK$1.147 billion. The total amount already committed but not yet withdrawn for investment in the long-term growth portfolio was HK$27.08 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded a negative 4.5% rate of return in 2022, with the investment portfolio returning -8.6% and the supporting portfolio returning -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\nChart 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 presents the investment return rate of the Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The average return rate of the Exchange Fund from 2020 to 2022 was 1.5%, from 2018 to 2022 was 2.3%, from 2013 to 2022 was 2.4%, and since 1994 has been 4.5%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward reference to the location of audited financial statements in a document. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"audited financial statements\" and \"Exchange Fund\" as key elements.\n- The page range \"pages 173 to 281\" is consistently and accurately translated.\n- The use of \"Exchange Fund\" is appropriate, as it is a recognized term for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's fund.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"for the year 2022,\" which is slightly more formal than necessary.\n- The second translation uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" which is less concise than \"Exchange Fund.\"\n- The third translation uses \"Regarding... see pages...\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more verbose.\n- The fourth translation uses \"See pages... for...\" which is direct but slightly less formal.\n- The fifth and sixth translations are very similar and both use \"for 2022\" and \"are on pages...\" which is natural and concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- The most natural and concise phrasing would be to use \"the audited 2022 financial statements of the Exchange Fund are on pages 173 to 281.\"\n- This avoids unnecessary prepositions and keeps the sentence straightforward and professional.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe audited 2022 financial statements of the Exchange Fund are on pages 173 to 281.\n\nFigure 1: Investment Rate of Return of the Foreign Exchange Fund (1994 to 2022)\n"}

風險管理\n\n管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險是金管局最重要的工作之一。風險管理除了體現於策略制定外，亦應用於日常運作層面。金管局的風險管理框架設有兩個高層次委員會，即宏觀監察委員會及風險委員會；兩者均由金管局總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍如下：\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融體系所面對的潛在風險與威脅，並商討可行對策；\n- 檢討現行貨幣及金融體系的風險管理措施，識別可能存在的漏洞，並確保措施完善；及\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享宏觀監察資訊，從而提高金管局的宏觀監察能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權範圍如下：\n- 識別金管局面對的潛在風險及威脅，並制定策略以減輕有關影響；\n- 檢討各部門現行的風險管理制度，識別可能存在的漏洞及重大風險，並確保備有適當措施應付有關情況；\n- 統一風險評估準則及方法，並就所識別的風險釐定資源管理的優先次序；及\n- 鼓勵及加強金管局內部的風險管理文化，推動適當的授權及監控。\n\n金管局設有一套穩健的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋機構層面及部門層面的組織架構風險。機構層面的風險泛指涉及整體機構所面對的中期風險，或需要跨部門共同應對的風險。在執行過程中，各部門需按季檢討及匯報其潛在和新興風險，以及所提出之監控措施和緩解策略，再輔以由上而下的機構風險管理模式，由各部門的管理高層識別影響較廣泛的主要風險及建議緩解措施。有關評估會經由風險委員會定期審議和決定適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審核\n\n內部審核處獨立及客觀評估金管局的管治、風險管理及監控程序是否足夠及具成效。該處職能上向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會匯報，行政上向金管局總裁匯報。內部審核處採用風險為本的方法進行業務運作及資訊系統審核，涵蓋各重大風險範疇。在2022年，該處就金管局的儲備管理、銀行監管工作、貨幣與金融發展、資訊科技及其他機構職能共進行28項審核。審核結果顯示金管局備有足夠及有效的監控措施，以管理金管局運作所產生的風險。\n","terms":{"銀行":["bank","banking

Functions of Institutions\n\nThe original text outlines the functions and communication strategies of a financial regulatory body, emphasizing transparency, efficiency, and public engagement. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Functional departments of the institution\" and \"realising excellent efficiency,\" which are fluent and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The institution\" is vague; \"the Monetary Authority\" should be specified as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity. Also, \"maintaining high transparency and accountability\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" consistently and \"professionalism\" is a strong term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Institutions’ functional units\" is unclear. \"Maintains effective communication with the community and markets\" is good, but \"its website\" should be \"its website\" (not \"website\" alone).\n3. **Third Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently and \"achieving excellent efficiency\" is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Functions departments\" is incorrect; \"functional departments\" is the correct term. Also, \"the overall society\" is awkward.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"functional departments of the institutions\" and \"demonstrating outstanding efficiency and professionalism\" is fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The institutions\" is vague. \"Operations\" is used twice, which is repetitive.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"institutional functional departments\" and \"demonstrating excellent efficiency and professionalism\" is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The whole society\" is slightly awkward; \"the whole society and markets\" is better than \"overall society.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Institutions, functional units, and departments\" and \"effective links\" is a good choice for \"繫.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Website\" should be \"website\" (not \"website\" alone). Also, \"the community and markets\" is good, but \"the whole society\" is better than \"overall society.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently.\n- Use \"functional departments\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"demonstrating\" or \"realising\" for \"發揮.\"\n- Use \"the whole society\" for \"整體社會.\"\n- Use \"maintains effective communication\" for \"保持有效聯繫.\"\n- Use \"website\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe functional departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority support its operations, maintaining high transparency and accountability, and demonstrating excellent efficiency and professionalism. To promote the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and work, the HKMA maintains effective communication with the whole society and markets through traditional and social media, websites, information centres, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has carefully established a team emphasizing agility in response and sustainable development, while adhering to strict financial discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to address changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n\n# Maintain transparency.\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use \"press conferences\" for \"發布會\" and \"press releases\" for \"新聞稿.\" However, \"場訪\" is translated as \"stand-up interviews\" in some translations, which is accurate, but \"on-site interviews\" or \"in-person interviews\" are also acceptable. The term \"次\" is consistently translated as \"times,\" which is appropriate.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some use awkward phrasing. For example, \"maintains close cooperation with the media\" is slightly more formal than \"maintains close contact with the media,\" which is more commonly used in official contexts. Also, \"the Monetary Authority closely Linked with the media\" in Translation 3 is grammatically incorrect due to the use of \"Linked\" as a verb without proper context.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The use of \"HKMA\" is appropriate in most translations, but in Translation 3, it is referred to as \"the Monetary Authority\" without the full name, which may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the term.\n4. **Dictionary Adherence**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, but some translations use \"on-site interviews\" for \"場訪,\" which is not listed in the dictionary. The correct term from the dictionary is \"stand-up interviews.\"\n5. **Numerical and Temporal Expressions**: The use of \"in 2022\" and \"during the year\" is consistent across translations. However, \"a total of\" is used correctly in most translations, though \"a total of 112 events\" is more natural than \"a total of 112 in-person and online events.\"\n6. **Word Choice**: \"Enhance transparency\" is more natural than \"improve transparency.\" Also, \"media inquiries\" is more standard than \"media questions.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close contact with the media to enhance transparency and improve the public's understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the HKMA held or participated in a total of 112 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 11 stand-up interviews, and 93 other public events. The HKMA also arranged 46 media interviews. During the year, a total of 492 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance the community's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's key functions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority holds press conferences and media briefings for local, Mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as the Currency Board's operations, green and sustainable finance, and central bank digital currency.\n\nDifferent media actively participated in the activities organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2022, including the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit.\" The summit lasted for three days and received significant media attention, with a total of over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending and conducting interviews. Approximately 1,000 news reports were published in local, regional, and international media. In addition, the event arranged live streaming for a total of 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively connect with the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority operates a total of six social media pages (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube), which have attracted over 100,000 followers. In 2022, the HKMA established a WeChat page to reach a broader audience. The HKMA uses social media to promote major events and initiatives, including the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\" and the Government Green Bonds program, and to enhance public awareness of multiple areas, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech, and scam prevention.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Yu Wai-man, accepted a media stand-up interview at the \"International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\".\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局總裁余偉文先生於「香港金融科技周2022」發表開幕主題演講**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"Mr. Yu Weiren, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered the opening theme speech at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022\".*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of \"Chief Executive\" for 總裁, correct use of \"Fintech\" for 金融科技, and proper structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Weiren\" is not the standard transliteration of 余偉文 (should be \"Wai-man\" or \"Wai Man\"). Also, \"theme speech\" is slightly awkward; \"keynote speech\" is more natural in this context.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Yoo Wai Man, delivered the opening keynote speech at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022\".*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"keynote speech\" and \"Fintech\".  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Yoo\" is an incorrect transliteration of 余 (should be \"Yu\"). Also, the name is misspelled as \"Wai Man\" instead of \"Wai-man\" or \"Wai Man.\"\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Chief Executive, Mr. Stephen Wilson, delivered an opening keynote speech at the \"Hong Kong FinTech Week 2022\".*  \n   - **Strengths**: Proper use of \"keynote speech\" and \"FinTech.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The name \"Stephen Wilson\" is incorrect; the actual name is 余偉文, which should be \"Yu Wai-man\" or \"Yu Wai Man.\"\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"Mr. Yu Wai Man, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered the opening theme speech at the Hong Kong Financial Technology Week 2022.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct name and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Theme speech\" is less natural than \"keynote speech.\" Also, \"Financial Technology Week\" is more verbose than \"Fintech Week.\"\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Yu Wai-man, delivered the opening theme speech at “Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022.”*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct name and use of \"Fintech.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Theme speech\" is less natural than \"keynote speech.\"\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Yu Wai-man, delivered the opening theme speech at “Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022.”*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct name and use of \"Fintech.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same as Translation 5; \"theme speech\" is less natural.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The correct name is **余偉文**, which should be transliterated as **Yu Wai-man** or **Yu Wai Man**.\n- The term **金融科技** should be translated as **Fintech** (as per the dictionary).\n- The term **開幕主題演講** should be translated as **opening keynote speech** (more natural than \"theme speech\").\n- The term **「香港金融科技周2022」** should be translated as **\"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022\"** (with quotation marks as per the dictionary).\n- The term **總裁** should be translated as **Chief Executive** (as per the dictionary).\n- The term **於** should be translated as **at** (as per the dictionary).\n### Final Translation:\nMr. Yu Wai-man, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered the opening keynote speech at \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022.\"\n\nMr. Reuben Kwan, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, spoke at the “Fintech Elite Forum 2022” co-hosted by Hong Kong and Accenture.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Deputy Chief Executive\" for 副總裁, and \"Fintech\" for 金融科技. The structure is clear and fluent.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Hong Kong\" is used instead of \"Digital Hong Kong\" (數碼港), which is a specific venue. Also, the name \"Reuben Kwan\" is not confirmed in the original text.\nVice Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Yuen Kwok-hung, spoke at the “Financial Tech Elite Forum 2022” co-hosted with Accenture in Hong Kong.\n- **Strengths**: Uses \"Vice Chief Executive\" for 副總裁 and \"Financial Tech\" for 金融科技. The structure is clear.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Yuen Kwok-hung\" is not confirmed in the original text. Also, \"in Hong Kong\" is vague; the event was at a specific venue, 数碼港.\nMr. Raymond Wong, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, spoke at the \"FinTech Elite Forum 2022\", co-hosted with Accenture at Digital Hong Kong.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"FinTech\" for 金融科技. Accurately identifies the venue as \"Digital Hong Kong.\"\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Raymond Wong\" is not confirmed in the original text.\nDeputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Wong Kwok Hang, spoke at the \"Fintech Elite Forum 2022\" co-hosted with Accenture at Digital Harbour.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"Fintech\" for 金融科技. Accurately identifies the venue as \"Digital Harbour.\"\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Wong Kwok Hang\" is not confirmed in the original text.\nMr. Wan Guoheng, Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, spoke at the Fintech Elite Forum 2022 co-hosted by Digital Harbour and Accenture.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Fintech\" for 金融科技 and identifies the venue as \"Digital Harbour.\"\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Vice Chairman\" is not the correct title for 副總裁. Also, \"Wan Guoheng\" is not confirmed in the original text.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Deputy Chief Executive, Mr. Kenneth Yuen, spoke at the \"Financial Technology Elite Forum 2022\" co-hosted by Hong Kong Digital Harbour and Accenture.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Deputy Chief Executive\" and \"Financial Technology\" for 金融科技.

About half of these involved banking consumer matters, banking sector policies and regulations, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. A significant number of these queries were about the coin collection program, banking products and services, banking-related guidance and notices, as well as the retail bond issuance program.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2019, and Figure 2 lists the breakdown of different types of inquiries in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **\"Figure 1 Total Public Questions\"** – This translation is grammatically correct and adheres to the dictionary, but it lacks a colon or punctuation after \"Figure 1,\" which is standard in such titles.\n2. **\"Figure 1: Total number of public questions\"** – This is a strong translation. It uses the correct term \"Figure\" and includes a colon, which is appropriate. However, \"questions\" is less precise than \"queries\" in a formal or technical context.\n3. **\"Figure 1 total number of public questions\"** – This translation lacks proper punctuation and capitalization after the colon, which affects readability and formality.\n4. **\"Figure 1: Total Public Questions\"** – This is very close to the best possible translation. It uses the correct term \"Figure,\" includes a colon, and capitalizes \"Total Public Questions\" appropriately. However, \"questions\" is still less precise than \"queries\" in a formal context.\n5. **\"Chart 1 Total Public Questions\"** – This translation uses \"Chart\" instead of \"Figure,\" which is acceptable, but it lacks a colon and proper punctuation, which affects formality and readability.\n6. **\"Figure 1 Total Number of Public Queries\"** – This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"Figure,\" includes a colon, and uses \"queries\" instead of \"questions,\" which is more precise in a formal or technical context. However, \"Total Number of\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and use the most precise terminology. \"Queries\" is more appropriate than \"questions\" in a technical or formal context, as it implies a more structured or formal inquiry. \"Figure\" is the most appropriate term for \"圖\" in this context, as it is commonly used in formal reports and charts. The inclusion of a colon after \"Figure 1\" is standard and improves readability. Therefore, the best translation is:\n**\"Figure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\"** – This translation is grammatically correct, uses the most appropriate terminology, and adheres to standard formatting conventions.\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the Authority publishes two issues of the \"Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability\" and four issues of the \"Quarterly Report,\" and regularly updates the data in the \"Monthly Financial Data Report,\" providing the latest and specialized data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the Authority publishes 17 articles in the \"Exchange Insights\" series, introducing the Authority's important measures and policies, and discussing matters of public concern.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2021 Annual Report received a Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Institutions\" category, as well as a Merit Award for \"Environment, Social, and Governance Reporting\" in the Hong Kong Management Professionals Association's 2022 Best Annual Report Selection.\n\n# Institution Website\n\nThe institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English and in both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The website also carries the \"Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Authorised Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensees of Stored Value Payment Tools,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been launching open application programming interfaces (open APIs) in phases since 2018, providing financial data and important information set out on its website. By the end of 2022, the Authority had launched a total of 148 groups of open APIs on its website in accordance with the original plan.\n\n# Information Centre\n# Information Centre\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2. It is an important facility that introduces the HKMA’s work to the public and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two parts: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking sectors in an interactive manner, and also provides data and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking industry, and financial affairs. The library, located adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications, covering topics such as Hong Kong’s currency, banking industry, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains, in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, the “Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Staff Involved in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions,” for public access.\n\nWith the pandemic gradually stabilizing, the Information Centre progressively resumed its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\nWith the pandemic gradually stabilizing, the Information Centre progressively resumed its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\n\nAfter reviewing the translations, it is evident that all six junior translators have produced nearly identical translations, with only minor variations in prepositions and word choice. The most notable difference is the use of \"Following a renovation\" in the third translation, which offers slight stylistic variation. However, all translations correctly use \"March 2023\" as the date, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"月\" (March). The term \"圖書館\" is consistently translated as \"library,\" which is correct. The term \"全新\" is translated as \"new,\" which is appropriate. The term \"重開\" is translated as \"reopened,\" which is accurate. The term \"公眾\" is translated as \"to the public,\" which is also correct.\nDespite the consistency, the translations could be improved by varying the sentence structure slightly to enhance fluency and avoid repetition. Additionally, the use of \"After renovation\" is repetitive across all translations. A more natural phrasing such as \"Following renovation\" or \"After undergoing renovation\" could add variety and improve readability.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the accuracy of the junior translators while enhancing fluency and variety in expression.\nAfter renovation, the new library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Linkages and Public Education  \nCommunity Liaison and Public Education  \nCommunity Linked and public education  \nCommunity Linkage and Public Education  \nCommunity Linked and Public Education  \nCommunity links and public education  \n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# 社區聯繫及公眾教育,\" translates to \"# Community Linkages and Public Education\" or similar variations. The key terms to be translated are \"聯繫\" (linkage\/links), \"公眾\" (public\/community), and \"教育\" (education). The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for these terms, and the junior translators have used them in various ways.\n1. **\"Community Linkages and Public Education\"** is grammatically correct and natural. \"Linkages\" is a strong term that conveys the idea of connections or relationships, which fits well with \"聯繫.\"\n2. **\"Community Liaison and Public Education\"** uses \"liaison,\" which is a more formal and specific term, often used in organizational or diplomatic contexts. While accurate, it may be less general than \"linkages\" or \"links.\"\n3. **\"Community Linked and public education\"** has a grammatical issue: \"Linked\" is an adjective and should be paired with a noun, such as \"Community Linked Initiatives\" or \"Community-Linked Programs.\" The phrase \"Community Linked and public education\" is awkward and lacks clarity.\n4. **\"Community Linkage and Public Education\"** is grammatically correct but slightly less natural than \"Linkages.\" \"Linkage\" is a singular noun, which may not convey the plural, ongoing nature of \"聯繫\" as effectively as \"linkages.\"\n5. **\"Community Linked and Public Education\"** is similar to the third translation but corrects the capitalization of \"public education.\" However, the use of \"Linked\" as an adjective without a noun is still problematic.\n6. **\"Community links and public education\"** is the most natural and fluent of the translations. \"Links\" is a common and natural English word that conveys the idea of connections or relationships, and it is grammatically correct in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nCommunity Links and Public Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held online seminars, attracting over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The seminars covered an introduction to the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the deposit protection scheme, and development opportunities in the banking sector. To date, the public education seminars have recorded participation from over 65,000 people.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is educating the public on how to be responsible financial consumers, particularly in light of the rise in phishing scams. However, there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and accurately convey the purpose of the campaigns.\n- The term \"phishing\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"網絡釣魚\" as \"phishing.\"\n- The translations generally use appropriate terms for \"SMS messages\" and \"credit cards,\" which are found in the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"buy now, pay later\" is correctly used in all translations, matching the dictionary entry for \"先買後付.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The term \"教育\" is translated as \"education\" or \"educates,\" which is correct, but \"educational\" is also an option in the dictionary. However, \"education\" is more natural in this context.\n- The term \"的\" is translated as \"’s,\" \"of,\" or \"the.\" In most cases, \"of\" or \"the\" are more appropriate, but \"’s\" is used inappropriately in some translations.\n- The term \"機\" is translated as \"machine\" or \"mechanism,\" but \"machine\" is not appropriate in the context of \"手機短訊\" (SMS messages). The correct translation should be \"mobile phone\" or \"cell phone,\" which is not in the dictionary, so the term \"機\" should be translated as \"machine\" only if it is clearly referring to a mechanical device.\n- The term \"鑑\" is translated as \"inspection\" or \"appraisal,\" but \"given\" or \"in view of\" would be more natural in this context.\n- The term \"所載\" is translated as \"set out\" or \"outlined,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"使\" is translated as \"to help\" or \"helping,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"手法\" is translated as \"practice\" or \"practices,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"網上\" is translated as \"online,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"消費者\" is translated as \"consumer\" or \"consumers,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"後\" is translated as \"after\" or \"following,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"人\" is translated as \"persons,\" \"people,\" or \"individuals,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"貸款\" is translated as \"loans,\" \"loan,\" or \"lending,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"銀行\" is translated as \"bank,\" \"banks,\" or \"banking sector,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"方\" is translated as \"party\" or \"parties,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"網絡\" is translated as \"network\" or \"cyber,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"偽\" is translated as \"forging,\" \"fake,\" or \"bogus,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"電台\" is translated as \"radio,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"短訊\" is translated as \"SMS messages,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"舉辦\" is translated as \"held,\" \"organised,\" or \"arranged,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"金融\" is translated as \"financial,\" \"finance,\" or \"financial sector,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"產品\" is translated as \"product\" or \"products,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"公眾\" is translated as \"public,\" \"the public,\" or \"community,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"支付\" is translated as \"payment\" or \"payments,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"體\" is translated as \"system\" or \"entity,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"發\" is translated as \"publish,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"亦\" is translated as \"also\" or \"too,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"騙案\" is translated as \"scams,\" \"fraud,\" or \"cases of fraud,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"進一步\" is translated as \"further,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"推出\" is translated as \"launch,\" \"rollout,\" or \"launching,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"涉及\" is translated as \"involving,\" \"involved,\" or \"relating,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"包括\" is translated as \"including,\" \"which include,\" or \"cover,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"增加\" is translated as \"increase,\" \"rise,\" or \"grow,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"負責任\" is translated as \"responsible,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"於\" is translated as \"in,\" \"at,\" or \"during,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"繫\" is translated as \"Linked,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"跨\" is translated as \"cross-boundary\" or \"cross-border,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"信用\" is translated as \"credit,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"「\" and \"」\" are translated as \"[not translated, see sentences]\" or \"\",\" which is correct.\n- The term \"市民\" is translated as \"public,\" \"Hong Kong public,\" or \"the general public,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"明\" is translated as \"clear,\" \"clearly,\" or \"statement,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"服務\" is translated as \"services,\" \"service,\" or \"Services,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"傳\" is translated as \"dissemination,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"活動\" is translated as \"event,\" \"events,\" \"activities,\" \"activity,\" or \"campaign,\" which is correct.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"education\" instead of \"educational\" for \"教育.\"\n- Use \"the public\" instead of \"public\" for \"公眾.\"\n- Use \"SMS messages\" instead of \"short messages\" for \"短訊.\"\n- Use \"cross-media\" instead of \"cross-boundary\" for \"跨.\"\n- Use \"bogus\" instead of \"forging\" for \"偽.\"\n- Use \"fraudulent practices\" instead of \"fraud\" for \"手法.\"\n- Use \"disseminating\" instead of \"publish\" for \"發.\"\n**Best Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) provides education and connects with the public, reminding them how to be smart and responsible financial services consumers. In view of the increase in \"phishing\" scams, the HKMA has launched a cross-media campaign to further remind the public to be vigilant against bogus hyperlinks set out in SMS messages and emails claiming to be from banks, and to be cautious of other fraudulent practices involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA also organizes radio and social media campaigns to disseminate tips on the smart use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods (including \"buy now, pay later\" products).\n\nA new short video titled \"Digital KEY: Keep an Eye on Things, Think Twice Before Clicking the LINK!\"\n\nTo assist the public in keeping pace with the development of fintech services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encourages the public to distribute electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year period through social media and radio. The HKMA produced an animated short film to explain open APIs and introduce matters to be mindful of when using banking services via mobile applications provided by third-party service providers (such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies). The animated short film also introduces the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment functionalities and advantages of \"FPS (Faster Payment System).\"\n\nAnimated short films help enhance the public’s digital financial knowledge.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and accurately translate \"見習經理計劃\" as \"Trainee Manager Program\" or \"manager trainee programme.\"\n- The phrase \"deepen the public's understanding of the financial sector\" is consistently and accurately translated, aligning with the dictionary's \"deepen... understanding\" for \"加深.\"\n- The use of \"interview video\" or \"interviews\" is appropriate for \"訪問短片\" or \"訪問.\"\n- The translations all convey the core message: the HKMA is working to increase public understanding and attract young people to the organization and industry.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"increase the interest of the younger generation in joining the HKMA and the industry\"** is a common phrase, but \"increase the interest\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"raise the interest of the younger generation in pursuing a career with the HKMA and the industry.\"\n- **\"improve the interest\"** (used in Translation 2) is grammatically incorrect, as \"interest\" is not something that can be \"improved\" in this context.\n- **\"enhance their understanding\"** is correct, but \"enhance\" is used inconsistently across translations. Some use \"enhance,\" others use \"increase\" or \"raise,\" which are all acceptable, but consistency is key.\n- **\"the HKMA's work\"** is correctly used in most translations, but \"HKMA's work\" should be \"the HKMA's work\" for grammatical correctness.\n- **\"the newly produced interview video\"** is more natural than \"newly created interview video\" or \"newly produced interviews.\"\n- **\"share their experiences\"** is more natural than \"share their personal experiences\" or \"share their experiences firsthand.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"deepen the public's understanding of the financial sector\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"raise the interest of the younger generation in pursuing a career with the HKMA and the industry.\"\n- Use \"the newly produced interview video.\"\n- Use \"share their experiences.\"\n- Use \"enhancing their understanding of the HKMA's work.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe HKMA also strives to deepen the public's understanding of the financial sector and raise the interest of the younger generation in pursuing a career with the HKMA and the industry. In the newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA Trainee Manager Program share their experiences, not only introducing the program to those interested in applying but also enhancing their understanding of the HKMA's work.\n\nTrainee Manager Program Graduates Share How to Prepare for Interviews\n\nTo enhance secondary school students' financial knowledge, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) co-hosted the 8th consecutive edition of the \"All-Hong Kong Financial Literacy Competition\" with multiple relevant institutions. This year's theme is green and sustainable finance, and students absorbed new knowledge through an online quiz competition (with a record number of participants), online seminars, and design thinking competitions.\n\nStudents explained creative solutions with green and sustainable elements in the design thinking competition to meet the need for managing personal finances.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the \"Little Financial Advisors\" online parent-child financial education activities during the March special holiday and August summer vacation in the 2021-22 academic year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, creating simple toys, and sharing sessions with financial and early childhood education experts, the program enabled kindergarten and primary school students to learn about banknotes and coins, basic concepts of banking and payment services, as well as financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills through online learning.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\nThe original text is \"# 財務披露\", which translates to \"Financial Disclosure\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The junior translators have mostly produced accurate translations, with minor differences in formatting and capitalization.\nThe first junior translator used \"Financial disclosure\" with lowercase \"disclosure,\" which is grammatically correct but less formal than the capitalized version. The second through sixth junior translators used \"Financial Disclosure\" with proper capitalization, which is more appropriate for a title or heading.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Financial Disclosure,\" as it maintains proper capitalization and accurately reflects the original text using the dictionary terms provided.\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards). The Financial Department prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. In addition, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and thorough analyses of each expenditure item and budget data in the Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Monitoring\nThe original text is a heading: \"# 問責性及監控\". The term \"問責性\" translates to \"accountability\" and \"監控\" should be translated using one of the provided alternatives: \"controls\" or \"monitoring\". Among these, \"monitoring\" is more appropriate in the context of a heading related to accountability, as it conveys the idea of oversight or supervision, which aligns well with \"accountability\".\nAll junior translators have correctly translated \"問責性\" as \"Accountability\" and \"監控\" as \"monitoring\". However, there are minor differences in formatting and capitalization. The first, fourth, and sixth translations use lowercase \"monitoring\", while the second, third, and fifth use \"Monitoring\" with a capital \"M\". The third and fifth translations also include the \"#\" symbol, which is present in the original text.\nConsidering the context and the need for a professional, consistent, and natural English heading, the best approach is to use \"Accountability and Monitoring\" with both words capitalized, as this is standard for headings in English. The \"#\" symbol should be retained as it appears in the original text. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"# Accountability and Monitoring\".\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking systems is one of the most important tasks of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Risk management is reflected not only in strategy formulation but also applied at the day-to-day operational level. The HKMA's risk management framework comprises two high-level committees, namely the Macro-prudential Oversight Committee and the Risk Committee; both are chaired by the HKMA Chief Executive.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of a macroprudential oversight committee in Hong Kong. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the committee as a \"macroprudential oversight committee\" or similar, which aligns with the dictionary's \"macro\" and \"monitoring\/supervision\/oversight.\"\n- The use of \"risk management measures\" and \"potential gaps\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"cross-departmental sharing\" or \"cross-boundary departments\" reflects the dictionary's \"cross-boundary\" or \"cross-department.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the term.\n- The term \"macroprudential\" is inconsistently capitalized or hyphenated.\n- \"Feasible measures\" is used in some translations, but \"countermeasures\" is more precise in the context of addressing risks.\n- \"Ensure measures are comprehensive\" is a common phrase, but \"ensure measures are adequate\" or \"ensure measures are complete\" are also acceptable.\n- The use of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more formal and precise than \"HKMA.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Macroprudential Oversight Committee\" consistently with proper capitalization.\n- Define \"HKMA\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n- Use \"countermeasures\" instead of \"measures\" when referring to responses to risks.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"cross-departmental\" or \"cross-boundary\" based on context.\n- Use \"enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s macroprudential oversight capacity\" for clarity and formality.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe scope of the Macroprudential Oversight Committee is as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats facing the Hong Kong monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible countermeasures;\n- Review existing risk management measures of the monetary and financial system, identify potential gaps, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential oversight information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s macroprudential oversight capacity.\n\nThe Risk Committee's scope of authority is as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats faced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and formulate strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Review the existing risk management systems in each department, identify potential gaps and significant risks, and ensure appropriate measures are in place to address the relevant situations;\n- Standardize risk assessment criteria and methods, and determine the priority of resource management in relation to the identified risks; and\n- Encourage and strengthen the internal risk management culture within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and promote appropriate authorisation and monitoring.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers organizational risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks faced by the entire institution or risks requiring cross-departmental collaboration to address. During implementation, each department is required to review and report quarterly on its potential and emerging risks, as well as the monitoring measures and mitigation strategies proposed, supported by a top-down institutional risk management approach. Senior management of each department identifies key risks with broader impacts and recommends mitigation measures. The relevant assessments will be regularly deliberated by the Risk Committee to determine appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 內部審核\". The dictionary provides three possible translations for \"審核\" — \"audited\", \"audit\", and \"Audit\" — and one for \"內部\" — \"internal\". The most appropriate translation for \"審核\" in this context is \"Audit\", as it is a noun and fits well with \"internal\" to form \"Internal Audit\", which is a standard term in business and quality management contexts. The use of \"audited\" would be more appropriate as an adjective, and \"audit\" as a verb would not fit the context of a heading.\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"內部審核\" as \"Internal Audit\", with the only variation being the use of a hashtag (#) and capitalization. However, in English, headings typically do not require a hashtag unless it is part of a specific formatting convention. Additionally, \"Internal Audit\" is usually capitalized as a proper noun when used as a heading or title.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is \"Internal Audit\" without the hashtag and with proper capitalization.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"risk-based approach\" and \"monitoring measures.\" It correctly uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"Chief Executive of the HKMA.\" However, it adds \"(HKMA)\" in parentheses, which is not in the original text and may be unnecessary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less specific. It also uses \"procedures\" instead of \"processes,\" which is a minor variation but still correct.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less accurate in terms of terminology. It refers to \"the financial sector\" instead of \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is a significant deviation from the original. It also uses \"controls\" instead of \"monitoring measures,\" which is not in line with the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first one, with the addition of \"(IAD)\" in parentheses. It is fluent and accurate, and it uses \"HKMA\" consistently. It also uses \"risk-based approach\" and \"monitoring measures\" correctly.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently and correctly. It also uses \"risk-based approach\" and \"monitoring measures\" appropriately. However, it uses \"various major risk areas\" instead of \"all major risk areas,\" which is a minor variation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly. It also uses \"adequate and effective controls\" instead of \"sufficient and effective monitoring measures,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"HKMA\" should be used consistently as it is the official name of the organization.\n- The term \"monitoring measures\" should be used as per the dictionary, not \"controls.\"\n- The phrase \"risk-based approach\" is appropriate and should be retained.\n- The term \"sufficient and effective\" should be used as per the dictionary, not \"adequate and effective.\"\n- The phrase \"a total of 28 audits\" should be used as per the dictionary, not \"28 audits.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the translations, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and the original text.\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are sufficient and effective. Functionally, the IAD reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively reports to the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in conducting business operations and information system audits, covering all major risk areas. In 2022, the IAD conducted a total of 28 audits on the HKMA's reserve management, banking supervision work, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other institutional functions. The audit results showed that the HKMA has sufficient and effective monitoring measures to manage the risks arising from its operations.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023

Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n- Audit Commission Report  \n- Foreign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission Head's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are minor differences in punctuation and capitalization that affect the fluency and professionalism of the titles. The most consistent and professionally formatted translation is \"Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary,\" which uses the correct possessive form and capitalization. The use of \"for\" instead of \"to\" in one translation is less appropriate in this context, as the report is addressed to the Financial Secretary, not prepared for them. The best translation maintains proper grammar, uses the correct terms from the dictionary, and presents the title in a natural and professional manner.\n\n# Opinions\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), set out on pages 179 to 281, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2022, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of key accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and they present a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2022, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in fluency and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. The first translation, \"Foundation of Opinions,\" is grammatically correct but uses \"Foundation\" with a capital letter, which may be unnecessary unless it is a proper noun. The second translation, \"the basis of opinions,\" is fluent and grammatically correct, and it uses \"basis\" from the dictionary, which is appropriate. The third and sixth translations, \"Opinion's Foundation,\" are grammatically correct but may be less natural in English, as \"Opinion's\" implies possession, which is not the intended meaning here. The fourth translation, \"# Basis of Opinion,\" includes a hashtag, which is not appropriate in this context. The fifth translation, \"The basis of opinions,\" is similar to the second but uses a capital \"The,\" which is acceptable in a title but may be unnecessary in a general statement.\nConsidering the dictionary guidelines, \"basis\" is the most appropriate translation for \"基礎\" in this context, and \"opinions\" is the best choice for \"意見.\" The phrase \"basis of opinions\" is the most natural and fluent translation that adheres to the dictionary guidelines. It is also the most commonly used phrase in English for expressing the foundation or reason behind a set of opinions.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be \"Basis of Opinions,\" which is concise, grammatically correct, and adheres to the dictionary guidelines.\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six junior translations and identified several key areas for improvement. All translations are generally accurate and fluent, but there are variations in word choice, phrasing, and adherence to the dictionary. Here are the main observations:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"audit,\" \"audit standards,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" and \"audit opinion.\" However, some translations use \"audit standards\" consistently, while others use \"auditing standards,\" which is also acceptable but slightly less precise.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but some use slightly more formal or awkward phrasing. For example, \"The responsibility I am under by virtue of those standards\" (Translation 4) is unnecessarily wordy compared to \"The responsibilities I have under those standards.\"\n3. **Consistency in Terminology**: Some translations use \"the Group\" with a capital \"G,\" while others use \"the group\" with a lowercase \"g.\" The original text does not specify capitalization, so either is acceptable, but consistency is important.\n4. **Word Choice**: \"Robust\" (used in Translation 3 and 4) is a strong synonym for \"adequate\" and may be more appropriate in this context. However, \"adequate and appropriate\" (used in most translations) is also correct and more aligned with the original tone.\n5. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally appropriate for a formal audit report in English.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, consistent in terminology, and use the most appropriate synonyms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the formal tone of an audit report. Based on this, the best elements from the translations are:\n- \"I have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission.\"\n- \"The responsibilities I have under those standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled 'Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements.'\"\n- \"In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.\"\n- \"I believe that the audit evidence obtained is adequate and appropriately provides a basis for my audit opinion.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. The responsibilities I have under those standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is adequate and appropriately provides a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters in the audit of the overall financial statements and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that affect the precision and naturalness of the final translation. \nTranslation 1 uses \"Accounted for at Fair Value,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common in financial reporting contexts. \"Accounted for\" is more general and may not fully capture the specific accounting treatment of financial assets and liabilities.\nTranslation 2 uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is the most precise and commonly used term in financial standards such as IFRS and GAAP. This phrasing is both accurate and natural in professional financial contexts.\nTranslation 3 uses \"Carried at Fair Value,\" which is also correct but slightly less common than \"measured at fair value.\" \"Carried\" is more often used in the context of carrying values on the balance sheet, which is related but not identical to the concept of measurement at fair value.\nTranslation 4 and 5 are identical and use \"accounted for at fair value,\" which, as noted earlier, is correct but not as precise as \"measured at fair value.\"\nTranslation 6 uses \"Recorded at Fair Value,\" which is grammatically correct but less standard in financial reporting than \"measured at fair value.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"measured at fair value\" as it is the most precise and standard term in financial reporting. It accurately reflects the accounting treatment described in the original text and is widely recognized in professional financial literature. \nTherefore, the improved translation is:\nValuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 of the financial statements.\n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$12,074.98 billion.\n\n87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured at fair value, which is the quoted price in an active market for the identical asset or liability (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation methods, with the parameters used based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe remaining 13% of the fair value of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total amount of these financial assets is HK$4,876.94 billion, mainly comprising non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the ample amount involved and relating to valuation, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: Uses \"ample\" for \"龐大\" and \"valuation\" for \"估值\", which are appropriate. The structure is clear.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"relating to valuation\" is vague and does not clearly reflect \"涉及估計\" (involving estimates). \"accounted for at fair value\" is not the most precise term for \"按公平值列帳\".\nGiven the large amounts involved and the estimates involved, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"large amounts\" for \"龐大\" and \"estimates\" for \"估計\".\n- **Weaknesses**: \"the estimates involved\" is repetitive and slightly awkward. \"accounted for at fair value\" is not the best phrasing.\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value constitutes a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: \"substantial amounts\" is a strong synonym for \"龐大\", and \"involvement of estimates\" is clear and natural.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"accounted for at fair value\" is still not the most accurate term for \"按公平值列帳\".\nGiven the large amount involved and the estimation, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value is a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: Uses \"large amount\" and \"estimation\" appropriately.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"the estimation\" is too vague and lacks clarity. \"carried at fair value\" is not the best term for \"按公平值列帳\".\nGiven the large amounts involved and relating to estimation, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: \"large amounts\" and \"measured at fair value\" are accurate.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"relating to estimation\" is unclear and does not fully capture \"涉及估計\".\nIn view of the large amount involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n- **Strengths**: \"In view of\" is a natural translation of \"鑑於\", \"large amount\" and \"involvement of estimates\" are accurate, and \"measured at fair value\" is precise.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"large amount\" should be \"large amounts\" to match the plural \"數額\" in the original.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"large amounts\" to match the plural \"數額\", \"involving estimates\" to accurately reflect \"涉及估計\", and \"measured at fair value\" to precisely translate \"按公平值列帳\". The phrase \"In view of\" is a natural and formal way to translate \"鑑於\".\nGiven the large amounts involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including relevant monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring measures, including those related to application programs in computer systems;  \n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;  \n- If market quotes are used, verifying the prices based on independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters based on independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investments in Property Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.11, 18, and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"fair value\" for \"公平值\" and \"independent professional valuers\" for \"獨立專業估值師.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the financial context is well maintained.\n- The use of \"HK$23,394 million\" or \"HK$39,631 million\" aligns with the dictionary's guidance for \"億.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"investment property\" (singular) instead of \"investment properties\" (plural), which is more appropriate given the context of multiple properties.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"with a total nominal value of HK$39.631 billion\" but incorrectly places \"with\" instead of \"having\" or \"amounting to.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"HKD\" instead of \"HK$\" and incorrectly translates \"233.94億港元\" as \"233.94 billion\" instead of \"23,394 million,\" which is a critical error in financial terminology.\n- **Translation 5** misplaces the numbers for \"4 joint ventures and 22 associate companies,\" which should be \"4 associate companies and 22 joint ventures\" as per the original text.\n- **Translation 1** and **Translation 4** are the most accurate in terms of structure, terminology, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"investment properties\" (plural) to match the original.\n- The correct numerical format should be \"HK$23,394 million\" and \"HK$39,631 million\" as per the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"with a total nominal value of\" should be used consistently for \"共值.\"\n- The term \"equity interests\" should be used for \"權益\" as it is more precise in financial contexts.\n- The structure should clearly indicate that the valuation is conducted by \"independent professional valuers\" and that the methods and assumptions are \"significant judgments and estimates.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, with a total nominal value of HK$23,394 million as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds equity interests in 4 associate companies and 22 joint ventures, which are primarily engaged in holding overseas investment properties, with the related equity interests having a total nominal value of HK$39,631 million. Regardless of whether these investment properties are held directly by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, their fair value is primarily determined by valuations conducted by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the core meaning of the original text, which outlines audit procedures for investment properties valued at fair value.\n- The use of terms like \"valuation reports,\" \"fair value,\" \"independence,\" and \"valuation methods\" is consistent with the dictionary and appropriate in context.\n- The structure of the bullet points is maintained in all translations, which is crucial for clarity in audit documentation.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"investment property\" while others use \"investment properties.\" The original text uses \"投資物業\" (investment property), which is singular, but in the context of audit procedures, it is more natural to use the plural \"investment properties.\"\n- **Dictionary Compliance:** The term \"獨立\" is translated as \"independent\" in most translations, which is correct. However, the term \"評估\" is translated as \"assessment\" or \"assessing,\" which is acceptable, but \"evaluation\" may be more precise in an audit context.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"the Group\" consistently, which is appropriate, while others use \"the group,\" which is less formal and less aligned with corporate audit language.\n- **Use of \"the\" and Possessive Forms:** The dictionary includes \"the\" as a possible translation for \"的,\" but in this context, possessive forms like \"the Group’s\" or \"the valuers’\" are more natural than \"of\" or \"’s.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n- The best translation should use \"investment properties\" to reflect the plural nature of the audit procedures.\n- \"Valuation methods\" is more precise than \"valuation technique\" or \"model\" in this context.\n- \"Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers\" is the most natural and professional phrasing.\n- \"The Group\" should be capitalized consistently to reflect the proper noun.\n- \"Fair value\" should be used as per the dictionary, and \"valuation reports\" should be capitalized if referring to formal documents.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associate companies or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority Commissioner must be responsible for other data. Other data includes all the information in the Monetary Authority's 2022 Annual Report, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I also do not issue any form of attestation conclusion regarding other data.\n\nWith regard to the audit of financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is significantly contradictory to the financial statements or to the circumstances I became aware of during the audit process, or whether it appears to contain significant misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains significant misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no reports.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of specific committees related to financial statements. The key terms in the dictionary must be translated precisely, and the overall structure must be grammatically correct and fluent in English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, the phrase \"Financial Management and the Audit Committee under the Advisory Committee of the Exchange Fund\" is slightly awkward and could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity. The phrase \"Financial Management Authority and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's responsibility regarding financial statements\" is confusing and misplaces the responsibility.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct but misplaces the \"Monetary Authority\" and \"Advisory Committee\" in a way that may confuse the reader. The phrase \"on the Exchange Fund’s Audit Committee’s responsibilities\" is not clearly structured.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct but uses \"bears responsibilities\" which is slightly less formal than \"has responsibility\" or \"is responsible for.\" The structure is clear but could be more concise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. The phrase \"in relation to the financial statements\" is a natural and formal way to express the relationship.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is not the most concise term in this context, and the structure could be more precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should clearly identify the \"Monetary Authority\" and the \"Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" as the entities responsible for the financial statements. It should use the dictionary terms accurately and maintain a formal, concise tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibility of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" (though the dictionary lists \"Monetary Authority\" for \"專員\"), and it uses \"material misstatements\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" instead of \"Monetary Authority,\" which may not be the exact term used in official contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Financial Management Officer\" (though \"Monetary Authority\" is in the dictionary), and it uses \"material misstatements\" as required. However, it repeats \"Financial Management Officer\" unnecessarily, which could be streamlined.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Monetary Authority\" (as per the dictionary). It also uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants\" instead of \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants,\" which is not in the dictionary. This is a deviation from the provided terms.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Financial Secretary\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"directions\" instead of \"instructions,\" which is not in the dictionary. It uses \"resulting from\" instead of \"due to,\" which is not a direct match for the dictionary term \"致.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Financial Management Monetary Authority,\" which is not a standard title and is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"deemed necessary\" instead of \"it deems necessary,\" which is slightly less natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" correctly, as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"for implement\" instead of \"to implement,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"as they consider necessary\" instead of \"it deems necessary,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The correct title for \"專員\" is \"Monetary Authority\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"香港會計師公會\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants\" (not \"Certified Public Accountants\").\n- \"發出\" should be \"issued\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"落實\" should be \"implement\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"重大錯誤陳述\" should be \"material misstatements\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"因欺詐或錯誤而導致\" should be \"due to fraud or error\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on this, the best possible translation would use \"Monetary Authority,\" \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants,\" \"issued,\" \"implement,\" \"material misstatements,\" and \"due to fraud or error.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing the internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue operating, and where applicable, disclosing matters relating to continued operation, and using continued operation as the accounting basis.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Advisory Committee of the Exchange Fund is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process of the group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Advisory Committee of the Exchange Fund\" is awkward phrasing. \"Monitoring\" is less precise than \"overseeing\" in this context. \"Of the group\" is less natural than \"the Group's.\"\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Natural phrasing, correct use of \"overseeing\" and \"group's.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is correct, but \"group's\" lacks the possessive apostrophe.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct structure, use of \"Group\" with capitalization, and \"overseeing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"of the Group\" is slightly less natural than \"the Group's.\"\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial Reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Possessive form is correct, \"Group’s\" is properly capitalized.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Reporting\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"process\" is lowercase, which is inconsistent.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the group’s financial report process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct possessive form and use of \"overseeing.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Report process\" is awkward phrasing; \"reporting process\" is more natural.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Natural phrasing, correct use of \"Group's\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monitoring\" is less precise than \"overseeing\" in this context.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **\"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\"** is the correct and most natural phrasing based on the dictionary.\n- **\"Audit Committee\"** is correctly used.\n- **\"Responsible for overseeing\"** is more precise and natural than \"monitoring\" in this context.\n- **\"The Group's financial reporting process\"** is the most natural and grammatically correct phrasing.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor's Responsibility in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, may affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nIn the process of conducting an audit in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements arising from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Commissioner are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Commissioner's practice of using the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained as of the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and time of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as relevant mitigating measures where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to may affect my independence, as well as the relevant mitigating measures, where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as relevant mitigating measures where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to possibly affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures in applicable situations.\nI also will submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I meet the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as related mitigating strategies where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independent, and communicate with them all matters that would reasonably affect my independence, and other matters, and, where applicable, related mitigating strategies.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as relevant mitigating measures where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,

All translations capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Audit Committee\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"Audit\" in \"key Audit matters\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's preference for \"audit\" in lowercase unless it's a proper noun.\n2. **Translation 2** is well-structured and accurate. It uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Audit Committee\" correctly. It also uses \"key audit matters\" consistently. However, it uses \"adverse consequences\" instead of \"negative consequences,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n3. **Translation 3** is fluent but slightly wordy. It uses \"most significant\" instead of \"most important,\" which is a minor deviation from the original. It also uses \"legal regulations\" instead of \"laws and regulations,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n4. **Translation 4** is concise and accurate. It uses \"key audit matters\" and \"laws and regulations\" correctly. However, it uses \"I describe\" instead of \"I will describe,\" which is a minor grammatical inconsistency.\n5. **Translation 5** is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"current period's financial statements\" and \"public interest it generates,\" which are natural phrasings. However, it uses \"legal regulations\" instead of \"laws and regulations,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Translation 6** has a minor issue with the structure: \"Advisory Committee under the Audit Committee of the Exchange Fund\" reverses the hierarchy. It should be \"Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" It also uses \"key audit items\" instead of \"key audit matters,\" which is a deviation from the dictionary's \"key.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Audit Committee\" correctly.\n- Use \"key audit matters\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"laws and regulations\" for consistency.\n- Maintain a formal yet fluent tone.\n- Ensure grammatical accuracy and clarity.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation is as follows:\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for this period and thus constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, because the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to exceed the public interest, and I determine that the matter should not be communicated in the report.\n\nAudit Commission Head Professor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nAudit Commission  \nHong Kong  \n66 Des Voeux Road Central\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text consists of three lines: \"審計署\", \"香港\", and \"金鐘道66號\". The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for \"審計\", including \"audit\", \"audits\", \"Audit Commission\", \"auditing\", \"audited\", and \"auditor\". Among these, \"Audit Commission\" is the most appropriate and commonly used term for an official auditing body, especially in a governmental or institutional context. Therefore, \"Audit Commission\" is the best choice for \"審計署\".\n\"香港\" is translated as \"Hong Kong\" in all translations, which is correct. However, the dictionary also includes \"Hong Kong’s\" and \"HKSAR\" as alternatives. In this context, \"Hong Kong\" is sufficient and more natural than \"HKSAR\" unless the text is part of an official government document.\nThe address \"金鐘道66號\" is the most challenging part. The junior translators have used various street names: \"Des Voeux Road Central\", \"Queensway\", \"Goldeneer Road\", \"Jinzhong Road\", \"Connaught Road Central\", and \"Gin Chung Road\". Among these, \"Des Voeux Road Central\" is the most accurate and commonly recognized name for \"金鐘道\" in Hong Kong. \"Connaught Road Central\" is close but not exact, and \"Gin Chung Road\" is a phonetic misrendering of \"金鐘道\". \"Queensway\" and \"Goldeneer Road\" are incorrect. \"Jinzhong Road\" is a direct transliteration but not the standard English name.\nThe number \"66\" is correctly translated as \"66\" in all translations, which is acceptable, though \"sixty-six\" is also grammatically correct. However, in addresses, numbers are typically written in numerals.\n**Improved Translation:**\nAudit Commission  \nHong Kong  \n66 Des Voeux Road Central\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
