{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are all very close to each other and generally accurate. The key term \"bedrock\" is correctly translated as \"基石\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary requirement. The only variation lies in the use of \"貨幣及金融\" versus \"貨幣與金融\" and \"穩定\" versus \"穩定性\".\n- **\"貨幣及金融\"** and **\"貨幣與金融\"** are both acceptable, but \"及\" is slightly more formal and commonly used in official or academic contexts, while \"與\" is more neutral and conversational. Given the context of the title, which is likely to be formal or academic, \"貨幣及金融\" is more appropriate.\n  \n- **\"穩定\"** is the correct term here, as it is a noun, matching the noun form of \"bedrock\" in the title. \"穩定性\" is an abstract noun and less direct in this context.\n- The use of **\"#\"** in translations 2, 5, and 6 is unnecessary unless the original text explicitly includes it as a heading or section marker. Since the original text does not include a hashtag, it should be omitted.\n- The punctuation and spacing are mostly consistent, though minor variations in spacing around colons and periods exist, which can affect readability in formal contexts.\n**Improved Translation:**\n貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度（LERS）幫助香港抵禦了多次挑戰和衝擊，展現其作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管本年面對困難的內外環境，聯繫匯率制度仍繼續以暢順有序的方式運作，再一次證明其在不確定性時期的韌性。香港銀行體系亦仍然穩健強大。事實勝於雄辯：港元匯率仍然穩定，並在近月內加強至兌換範圍的強方，而銀行存款亦在本年持續增長。簡單而言，未觀察到港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映我們體系的穩健，亦反映我們對體系的強大信心。這並非一夜之間發生，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝機制並加強監察，輔以我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速回應。\n\n我們多年來為雨天所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣和銀行體系建立了穩固的根基和強大的緩衝。此外，我們的銀行體系擁有龐大的外匯儲備及強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常良好的資產質素，無論是按國際還是歷史標準來衡量。自2009年以來落實的八輪針對物業按揭的逆週期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大加強了銀行對樓市逆轉的抵抗力。\n我們多年來為雨天所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣和銀行體系建立了穩固的根基和強大的緩衝。此外，我們的銀行體系擁有龐大的外匯儲備及強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常良好的資產質素，無論是按國際還是歷史標準來衡量。自2009年以來落實的八輪針對物業按揭的逆週期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大加強了銀行對樓市逆轉的抵抗力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監管構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監管架構。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的新猷之一是運用從銀行收集的細緻數據，以更深入及適時的方式提升我們監察港元資金及金融市場活動的能力。因應經濟及營運環境的快速變化，壓力測試及應變計劃亦已加強。\n市場監察及銀行監管構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監管架構。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的新猷之一是運用從銀行收集的細緻數據，以更深入及適時的方式提升我們監察港元資金及金融市場活動的能力。因應經濟及營運環境的快速變化，壓力測試及應變計劃亦已加強。\n\n事實上，我們強大而完善的監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。在本年度內，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具備良好條件，能夠應對周期性及結構性變化，鑒於其擁有重大緩衝。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得金融行動特別任務組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太區首個在FATF互認評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，對保障貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系造成懷疑的惡意謠言保持高度警覺，並迅速作出回應。鑒於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及使用，這一點特別重要。在社會事件爆發期間，恐慌製造者透過社交媒體平台散播了各種謠言，我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速而明確地澄清這些謠言，證明這有助於釋除疑慮、制止不實謠言進一步傳播，並維持國際及公眾對我們體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有翻譯版本都正確使用了「活動」一詞，符合詞典要求。從語法和流暢度來看，各版本均無明顯錯誤，但細節上仍有改進空間。\n第一版翻譯「銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱。」語法正確，用詞自然，但缺少標題符號「#」，與原文格式不一致。\n第二版至第六版均使用了「#」符號，符合原文格式，但第三版使用「銀行業」一詞，與原文「banking system」不完全對應，「銀行業」更偏向「banking industry」，語義略有偏差。\n第四版和第五版與第二版相同，均為「# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱」，語法正確，格式與原文一致，用詞自然。\n第六版「銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱」語法正確，但缺少「#」符號，與原文格式不一致。\n綜合考量，最佳翻譯應使用「銀行體系」一詞，因其更貼近「banking system」的語義，且格式上應保留原文的「#」符號，以保持一致性。因此，最佳翻譯為：「# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱」。\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，發揮基本作用，確保社會和經濟的暢順運作。儘管自下半年以來營運環境困難，銀行機構一直與其他機構一同努力，竭盡全力維持其核心功能的正常運作，並繼續服務企業和公眾。\n\n除了存款及轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能在於向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們清楚明白，並關切企業，特別是中小企，在困難經濟環境下面對的資金周轉問題。在保障銀行體系穩定的同時，我們已推出一系列措施，以確保持續向中小企提供資金支持。特別是，銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率在2019年10月及2020年3月兩次下調，總共下調150個基點至1.0%；2020年4月，銀行的法定準備金率亦減半。這些措施釋放約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多空間，向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行界中小企貸款協調機制，匯聚香港主要銀行，一同探討及討論具體措施，以加強對中小企的資金支持。我樂見不少銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，為有需要的客戶引入如「還息不還本」等緩衝措施，以幫助他們克服當前難關。\n\n鑒於各個譯文在語法、用詞及語境適切性上均有不同程度的問題，以下為綜合評估與改進建議：\n1. **用詞準確性**：所有譯文均正確使用了詞典中指定的詞彙，如「中小企」、「簡易帳戶」、「推動」、「精簡」等，但部分譯文在語境中未能完全契合，例如「effort」被譯為「努力」是正確的，但「作出致力的 effort」語感不自然，應調整為「作出致力的 effort」或直接使用「致力」。\n2. **語法與語感**：譯文1中「作出致力的 effort」語法不正確，應為「作出致力的 effort」或直接使用「致力」。譯文2中「其客戶審查流程已精簡」語序不自然，應調整為「配有精簡的客戶審查流程」。譯文3中「我們的努力已作出成效」語序不自然，應為「我們的努力已見成效」。\n3. **語境與流暢度**：譯文5與譯文6在語境與流暢度上表現最佳，尤其在「推動推出分層帳戶服務」與「採用精簡的客戶盡職審查程序」等語句上，語感自然，符合中文表達習慣。\n4. **文化適切性**：所有譯文均未出現文化不適應的問題，語句均符合香港地區的語境與用語習慣。\n**改進建議**：在語法正確、用詞準確的基礎上，應優化語序與語感，使譯文更自然流暢，並確保語境與原文一致。\n---\n鑒於部分中小企反映開立銀行帳戶存在困難，而這正是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們過去幾年來一直致力應對這個問題。我們的工作已見成效，企業開戶的改善情況已可見。為進一步推動金融包容，香港金管局推動推出分層帳戶服務－簡易銀行帳戶（SBAs），採用精簡的客戶盡職審查程序，為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代選擇。截至目前為止，已開立超過2,800個SBAs。\n\n# 國際金融中心：實力不斷增強\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, *International financial centre: from strength to strength*, is a concise and idiomatic expression that conveys the idea of continued growth and reinforcement of a financial hub's capabilities. The dictionary specifies that the term *strength* must be translated as *實力*, and this must be used in the final translation.\n**Translation Analysis:**\n1. **First junior translator:** *# 國際金融中心：從實力到實力*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses *實力* as required.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase *從實力到實力* is literal and lacks fluency. It does not convey the intended meaning of \"from strength to strength\" as a metaphor for continued growth or reinforcement.\n2. **Second junior translator:** *國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上*  \n   - **Strengths:** *蒸蒸日上* is a common and idiomatic expression in Chinese that means \"rising steadily\" or \"prospering,\" which aligns well with the idea of continued growth.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The dictionary requires *strength* to be translated as *實力*, and this translation omits that term entirely, violating the dictionary constraint.\n3. **Third junior translator:** *國際金融中心：實力不斷提升*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses *實力* as required and conveys the idea of increasing strength.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase *不斷提升* (constantly improving) is slightly more dynamic than the original, which is more about maintaining and reinforcing strength rather than continuous improvement.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** *# 國際金融中心：從實力到實力*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation—literal and unidiomatic.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** *國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上。*  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the second translation—omits *實力* and violates the dictionary constraint.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** *# 國際金融中心：實力不斷增強*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses *實力* and conveys the idea of increasing strength.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** *不斷增強* (constantly strengthening) is slightly more dynamic than the original, but it is still a close match and idiomatic in Chinese.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nWhile *蒸蒸日上* is a strong and idiomatic expression, it does not use *實力* as required by the dictionary. Therefore, it cannot be used in the final translation. Among the translations that use *實力*, the sixth junior translator's version—*實力不斷增強*—is the most natural and idiomatic, accurately reflecting the idea of continued growth and reinforcement of strength. It is concise, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate. Thus, it is the best choice for the final translation.\n\n我們一直留意需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期的穩定。共有四個重點範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫，以及人才發展。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，我們需關注語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性，以及是否符合中文表達習慣。以下為各份翻譯的評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一份翻譯**：語句結構較為繁複，如「我們一直留意到在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡的需要」語序略顯生硬，可簡化為「我們一直留意需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡」，使語句更自然。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，符合中文語法與表達習慣，是目前較佳的版本之一。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：「我們需要加強」語氣較弱，與原文「we have to work hard to strengthen」的強調語氣不一致，應使用「我們必須努力加強」更為合適。此外，「與內地金融互聯互通」雖正確，但「金融聯繫」更為通用。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：「金融中心當中」語序不自然，應為「金融中心之間」。此外，「金融聯通」雖正確，但「金融聯繫」更符合常見用法。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：使用「與內地嘅金融互聯互通」中「嘅」為粵語用字，不符合繁體中文標準用字，應改為「的」。此外，語句結構較為混亂，影響閱讀流暢度。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，但「穩定性」與原文「stability」語意略有差異，「穩定」更貼切。此外，「共有四個重點範疇」語句自然，符合中文表達習慣。\n**改進建議：**  \n在翻譯時，應確保語句結構自然、語氣與原文一致，並使用符合繁體中文語境的用字。例如，「must work hard to strengthen」應翻譯為「必須努力加強」，強調語氣；「financial connectivity」應翻譯為「金融聯繫」，而非「金融聯通」或「金融互聯互通」，以保持語意準確與語句簡潔。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n我們一直留意需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期的穩定。共有四個重點範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫，以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向科技於數碼時代\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original title is \"# Embracing technology in the digital era\". The dictionary specifies that \"era\" should be translated as \"時代\" and \"Embracing\" as \"迎向\". The junior translators have attempted various structures, but none fully capture the intended meaning and flow.\n1. \"迎向科技於數碼時代\" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning, but the structure feels slightly awkward in Traditional Chinese. The phrase \"於數碼時代\" is correct, but the placement of \"迎向科技\" at the beginning may not be the most natural.\n2. \"迎向科技在數位時代\" uses \"在數位時代\" which is slightly more natural than \"於數碼時代\", but \"數位時代\" is not the exact match for \"digital era\" from the dictionary. The dictionary specifies \"時代\" for \"era\", so \"數碼時代\" is more accurate.\n3. \"迎向數位時代的科技\" changes the focus to \"the technology of the digital era\" rather than \"embracing technology in the digital era\", which slightly alters the meaning.\n4. \"迎向科技的時代\" is grammatically correct but changes the meaning to \"the era of embracing technology\", which is not the same as the original.\n5. and 6. \"迎向數位時代的科技\" repeats the issue from translation 3, altering the meaning slightly.\nThe best approach would be to use \"迎向科技於數碼時代\" but adjust the structure for better fluency. A more natural and accurate translation would be \"迎向科技於數碼時代\", which maintains the dictionary terms and conveys the intended meaning clearly.\nFinal Translation:\n迎向科技於數碼時代\n\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室，以及2017年引入智能銀行計劃以來，一直在快速推動金融科技的發展。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯員的翻譯時，我們發現他們都正確使用了詞彙表中的關鍵詞，如「設立」、「引入」、「推動」、「快速」、「2016年」、「2017年」和「自」。然而，翻譯的流暢度、語序和語感仍有改進空間。\n1. **第一個翻譯**：語法正確，但重複使用「金融科技（金融科技）」略顯冗餘，且語序稍顯生硬。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：語序自然，用詞準確，但「在推動金融科技（fintech）方面發展迅速」略顯不夠緊湊。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：語序正確，但「以及」的使用導致句子結構略顯鬆散。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：最接近最佳翻譯，語序自然，用詞準確，且避免了重複。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：使用「金融科技促進辦事處」與「倡議」與原文不完全一致，且語序略顯不自然。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：使用「便利辦公室」與「倡議」與詞彙表中的「Facilitation Office」和「initiatives」不完全對應，且「快速發展」與「推動」語意重複。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保語序自然，符合中文表達習慣。\n- 避免重複用詞，如「金融科技（fintech）」。\n- 使用詞彙表中準確的對應詞，如「促進辦公室」而非「便利辦公室」或「辦事處」。\n- 確保「推動」與「發展」語意不重複，語句緊湊。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室，以及2017年引入智能銀行計劃以來，一直在快速推動金融科技的發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力可見於轉數快（FPS）採用上的強大勢頭。轉數快是全球首個支援多幣種、跨行及電子錢包的實時零售支付平台。在短短15個月內，轉數快的登記數目已達到四百萬，相當於在750萬人口中達到較高的滲透率。政府亦採用轉數快，為公眾提供繳交稅款、地稅及水費時的更大便利。預計越來越多企業將使用這種快速、安全及方便的收取及支付方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務營運方面已取得重大進展。根據香港金融管理局進行的一項研究，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用，或正計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用中。在香港金融管理局的協助下，銀行已在其個人信貸產品中應用大數據及消費者行為分析。他們亦已在首兩個階段推出了超過800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。雖然我們鼓勵銀行使用金融科技，但我們亦沒有忽略在數碼銀行服務中加強科技風險管理及消費者保護的需要。我們已在這些範疇向銀行提供了適時的監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行極為關注的另一個領域，因其潛在能力可支持銀行更有效率且有效益地進行合規管理和風險管理，特別是在反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech並建立更廣泛的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發行了首份Regtech通訊，以探討Regtech的潛在應用情況。同時，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA正在探討使用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年落實Suptech的藍圖。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這只是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。香港金融管理局於本年批出8張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒開始試點計劃。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及為香港市民引入更多創新及多元的銀行服務，以幫助提高我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n國際層面亦預期有更多精彩發展。在成功完成將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect 與其歐洲對接夥伴連接的試驗後，我們正進行另一項試驗，與中國人民銀行平台合作，為跨境貿易的數碼化鋪路。我們已開始與泰國銀行合作進行聯合研究項目，研究央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於 11 月在香港投入運作其首個創新中心，以促進中央銀行界內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展清楚顯示香港在全球金融科技發展中的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及可持續金融，邁向更好未來。\n\n氣候相關風險近年來備受全球關注。為貢獻於全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於5月公布三項關鍵措施，以推動香港在不同領域的綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正推動一個分三個階段的策略，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業務。在第一階段，已制定一套評估銀行「綠色基準」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管期望和要求，以及第三階段的落實鋪路。\n\n作為匯豐基金的經理，香港金融管理局積極推進責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資活動中。具體而言，我們採用了在風險調整後的基礎上，若綠色及ESG投資的長線回報與其他投資相若，則優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則。自2015年作為早期投資者之一進入綠色債券市場以來，我們將繼續擴大綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦將與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件之下回軟，同時勞動市場面臨增加的壓力。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, using the correct dictionary terms. It correctly uses \"持續的中美貿易摩擦\" and \"增加的壓力.\" However, the structure \"在...之下\" is slightly awkward in this context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is also fluent and accurate, using \"國際經濟減速\" instead of \"全球經濟放緩,\" which is a minor variation but still acceptable. It uses \"背景下\" instead of \"在...之下,\" which is more natural in this context.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is very close to the best version, using \"美國與中國\" instead of \"中美,\" which is slightly more verbose but still correct. It also uses \"勞動力市場\" instead of \"勞動市場,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is grammatically correct but overly fragmented, with unnecessary spaces and a less natural flow. It uses \"二零一九年\" and \"增加 的 壓力,\" which are not as natural in formal writing.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is the most natural and fluent, using \"出現回軟\" instead of \"回軟\" for a more dynamic expression. It also uses \"日益增加的壓力\" instead of \"增加的壓力,\" which is more idiomatic in Chinese.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is accurate but slightly awkward in structure, placing \"面對全球經濟減速...\" after the main clause, which disrupts the flow.\n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**\nThe best version should combine the strengths of the most fluent translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary terms. The phrase \"在...之下\" is appropriate, but \"背景下\" is more natural in formal writing. \"中美貿易摩擦\" is more concise than \"美國與中國貿易摩擦.\" \"勞動市場\" is more commonly used than \"勞動力市場.\" \"增加的壓力\" is correct, but \"日益增加的壓力\" is more idiomatic. The structure should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.\n**Final Translation:**\n香港經濟在2019年全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件的背景下回軟，同時勞動市場面臨日益增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健且有韌性，擁有強大資本基礎、充足的流動性及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管面對困難的外部及內部環境，香港的貨幣制度穩固如初，這從港元匯率的穩定以及外匯和貨幣市場的暢順運作中反映出來。這不僅反映香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦反映外界對香港貨幣制度的強大信心。\n\n引入了一項新解決方案機制，並在香港金融管理局修訂的流動性設施框架內作出若干優化措施。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局投放巨大努力，監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推動智能銀行方面亦作出良好進展，包括授予8間虛擬銀行牌照，以及鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力亦輔以加強對銀行科技風險管理的監督，以及加強數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n香港金融管理局理順投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時採取進一步舉措推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度獲得金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評估，使其成為亞太區首個在FATF第四輪互認評估中取得整體合規結果的FATF成員管轄區。\n\n新規則和法規已推出，以提升銀行監管制度，符合最新國際標準。香港公佈了一個三個階段的方案，推動綠色和可持續銀行業務，成為全球應對氣候變化的努力的一部分。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局在落實銀行解決機制方面取得重大進展，特別是推動本地系統重要銀行建立一層新的損失吸收能力，以促進金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正增強強大勢頭，銀行業在開放應用程式介面框架的落實方面取得良好進展，並設立了全球首個國際清算銀行創新中心，同時電子支付中使用更快支付系統的數量持續增加。\n香港的金融科技生態系統正增強強大勢頭，銀行業在開放應用程式介面框架的落實方面取得良好進展，並設立了全球首個國際清算銀行創新中心，同時電子支付中使用更快支付系統的數量持續增加。\n\n香港保持堅定的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地的金融聯繫正在加強，香港居民獲得金融服務也更加方便。\n\n作出大量努力以開放新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別是在基礎設施投資及融資、綠色金融及私人股權基金方面。\n\n香港金融學院設立，旨在作為培育財務領導才能的卓越中心，並作為貨幣與金融研究知識的寶庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n受惠於利好投資環境，金管局錄得歷來第二高的投資收入，達2,622億港元，相當於6.6%的投資回報率。\n受惠於利好投資環境，金管局錄得歷來第二高的投資收入，達2,622億港元，相當於6.6%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局深化其在投資多元化方面的努力，尤其著重於長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP自2009年成立以來，錄得年化內部回報率12.6%。在推動責任投資方面亦有令人鼓舞的進展。\n\n# 企業功能與企業職能兩種譯法在語義上略有差異。「功能」強調的是企業所具備的具體作用與能力，而「職能」則更偏向於企業內部各部門所承擔的職責與功能。根據原文「Corporate Functions」的語境，這裡更傾向於指企業所具備的各種功能與作用，因此「企業功能」更為恰當。此外，部分譯文在格式上保留了原文的「#」符號，但根據中文排版習慣，通常不建議在標題中使用此類符號，除非有特殊格式要求。因此，最佳的翻譯應為「企業功能」，並去除不必要的標點符號。\n企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，保持與社區及市場的有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，香港金融管理局重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n在機構內，香港金融管理局重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易衝突及本地社會事件。隨著經濟情況在下半年迅速惡化，勞動市場面對增加的壓力。通脹亦因豬肉價格急升而增加。鑒於新型冠狀病毒疫情對已經轉弱的經濟雪上加霜，預計2020年的經濟表現將維持困難。鑒於困難的經濟環境，政府及金管局已推出措施支持經濟，尤其家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n繼2018年增長2.9%後，香港經濟在2019年收縮1.2%，標誌着自2009年以來首個年度收縮。特別是在下半年，經濟進入衰退，經季節性調整後的實際國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三及第四季度連續收縮（表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映了國內需求的顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件在下半年對消費活動和情緒造成顯著影響，私人消費支出出現自2003年以來的首個年度下跌。整體投資開支亦因企業情緒低迷而下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩，以及在中美貿易摩擦之下加徵的額外關稅，導致香港貨物出口下跌。服務出口亦創下歷來最大年度跌幅，因社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重轉差。在較小的本地需求及轉口需求影響下，貨物及服務進口亦轉差。從淨出口基礎來看，淨貿易在2019年對GDP帶來支持（圖1），因為總進口下跌速度甚至快於總出口下跌速度。\n\n鑑於經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多項措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企以及受重創的行業，例如零售、食品服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並幫助緩和經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率由2.5%減至2.0%，從而讓銀行擁有更多靈活性，釋放200至300億港元的銀行信貸，提供給包括中小企在內的企業，亦設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。此外，於9月推出了中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）80%擔保產品的新緩衝措施，讓面對資金流轉轉弱的中小企借款人可申請還息不還本，以獲得即時支持。進一步地，於12月推出了SFGS下的新九成貸款擔保產品，以提供額外支持予中小企、經營經驗較少的企業，以及希望設立自己專業實踐的專業人士，以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。港元匯率全年大致穩定。由於3月觸發了弱方兌換承擔，金管局以7.85港元兌1美元的匯率向銀行購入港元，並向銀行出售美元，導致根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，總結餘按相應方式下降。港元銀行間利率在更長期端大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多間零售銀行在10月底隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下調，將其最佳貸款利率調低12.5個基點。至於貨幣供應總額，2019年銀行總貸款額增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升，而全年總存款額則增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n基礎通脹率剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，由2018年的2.6%輕微上升至2019年的3.0%。通脹的輕微上升主要由自5月起新鮮豬肉供應受阻所導致的豬肉價格上漲帶動（圖2）。若排除基本食品項目，價格壓力全年大致維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價通脹中的住房部分與較早前新鮮出租私人住宅租金的整合同步放緩。更廣泛而言，名義工資的輕微增長及商業租金的放緩增加，幫助控制本地企業成本。從外部因素看，進口物價通脹放緩，與全球經濟增長放緩背景下香港部分主要進口來源的通脹下降相符合。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場大致保持韌性，但下半年面臨日益增加的壓力（圖3）。在首兩個季度維持多年低點2.8%後，經季節性調整的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，第四季度則上升至3.3%，其中與消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率在社會事件背景下甚至出現更明顯的上升。整體勞動需求在下半年亦明顯收縮，因總就業人數及私人部門職位空缺數目下降。勞動需求的減少在零售、住宿及食品服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業中特別明顯。在供給方面，勞動力參與率輕微下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的周期性回應。隨著勞動市場面臨日益增加的壓力，名義工資和收入的增長在年底顯示出放緩跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈波動。在首四個月市場一度攀升後，由於美國與中國貿易摩擦再度升溫，恆生指數在5月急跌（圖4）。雖然在6月因主要央行顯示較為寬鬆的貨幣政策而部分回復跌幅，但股市在經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件的影響下，再度承受壓力。年尾時，股市在美國與內地達成「第一階段」貿易協議後，重拾上升勢頭。恆生指數以28,190點收市，全年整體升幅達9.1%。相對而言，平均每日成交額較去年同期下跌約19%。一家重大內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，幫助透過首次公開招股（IpOs）籌集的股本資金增至2019年的3,142億港元。香港在透過IpOs籌集資金方面，連續第二年高踞全球首位。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年首五個月出現強勁反彈，但其後整體趨勢轉為軟化。2019年初市場氣氛有所提升，部分原因是對中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩和，但其後因中美貿易摩擦再度升級、持續的社會事件及國內經濟狀況轉差，市場氣氛再度受挫。整體樓價自5月峰值至12月回落5%，但由於首五個月樓價反彈10%，全年樓價仍錄得5%的年增長（圖4）。2019年的交易量較去年同期增加4%，達59,797宗，反映年初交易活動強勁。住宅物業的負擔能力仍然偏緊，價格與收入比率及收入負擔比率分別高達17.9和80.9，遠高於其長線平均水準。為協助有即時購樓需要的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）於10月中調高了「按揭保險計劃」中可申請按揭貸款的已落成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，2019年非住宅物業市場面對更強的下行壓力。特別是零售物業的價格和租金自2008年全球金融危機以來錄得最大跌幅，反映當年商業環境持續轉差。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2020年的經濟表現預期將非常困難，與新型冠狀病毒爆發相關的重大短期下行風險仍然存在。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊及運輸，尚未從社會事件所造成的干擾中復原，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，2020\/21年度預算中公布的逆週期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放以及在SFGS下推出的新優惠低息貸款（政府提供100%擔保），預計將為經濟提供一定程度的支持，特別是家庭和中小企。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局進一步將銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率從2.0%下調至1.0%，這將讓銀行能更支持本地經濟，特別是那些預計會因新型冠狀病毒爆發的影響而經歷額外短期壓力的行業和個人。從GDP組成部分分析，私人消費和投資可能仍將疲弱，因為消費者和企業信心脆弱。雖然政府消費將對經濟增長有所貢獻，但公共投資開支預計在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後將相對放緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估在短期內對本地經濟略有正面影響。然而，香港的外貿表現仍將受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲弱的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長範圍為-1.5%至0.5%，而國際組織和私人分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預計在2020年會因經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃市場整合以及輕微的進口通貨膨脹而趨於溫和。市場共識預測2020年的整體通貨膨脹率為1.8%，而政府則預測整體和基礎通貨膨脹率將分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲弱及冠狀病毒疫情爆發，失業率在近期可能進一步上升。私人部門分析師預期2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景黯淡，面臨著多項不確定性與風險，包括全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、中國大陸的經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新型冠狀病毒疫情的持續。特別是，持續的新型冠狀病毒疫情可能觸發更可見的全球經濟放緩與資產重新定價，導致不利的宏觀經濟環境與更緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟活動帶來下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為共同的貨幣政策寬鬆努力，可能提供緩衝，以抵消疫情帶來的負面經濟影響。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管各版本的翻譯都大致準確地傳達了原文的意思，但在語感、用詞選擇與語序上仍有改進空間。以下為各版本的評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一版翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，符合傳統中文語法。但「貸款和存款均溫和增長」中的「溫和」與「適度」相比略顯口語化，建議使用「適度」更符合正式語境。\n2. **第二版翻譯**：語句流暢，用詞精準，尤其在「穩步增長」與「維持良好」的搭配上表現優異。但「資產質素」一詞在中文中較少見，建議使用「資產品質」更為自然。\n3. **第三版翻譯**：整體語句通順，但「資產質量亦保持良好」中的「質量」與「品質」相比略顯不常見，建議使用「品質」或「品質良好」更符合中文習慣。\n4. **第四版翻譯**：語句流暢，用詞準確，尤其在「以適度速度增長」的表達上較為精確。但「資產質素亦維持良好」與「資產品質」相比略顯不自然。\n5. **第五版翻譯**：語句通順，但「貸款和存款均適度增長」與「資產品質維持良好」的搭配略顯重複，建議調整語序以提升流暢度。\n6. **第六版翻譯**：整體表現良好，但「資產回報率穩定的情況下，仍錄得盈利」語序略顯拗口，建議調整為「在資產回報率穩定的情況下仍錄得盈利」更自然。\n**改進建議**：在語序上，應優先使用「銀行業」而非「銀行」以符合原文語境；在用詞上，應優先使用「資產品質」而非「資產質素」；在語感上，應避免過於口語化的詞語如「溫和」，改為「適度」更正式。\n**最佳翻譯**：\n儘管2019年面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件等困難環境，香港銀行業仍表現出韌性。銀行資產負債表趨勢保持穩定，貸款及存款均適度增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況仍然穩固，資產品質亦保持良好。銀行業在資產回報率穩定的情況下，仍錄得盈利。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣穩定性\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場以暢順有序的方式運作。港元匯率全年保持穩定，並於年底加強至兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在國際外匯市場對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內，即外匯價值穩定。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由香港外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須有相應的100%美元儲備變化來配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe six translations provided by the junior translators are largely consistent in meaning and structure. The term \"Monetary Base\" is accurately translated as \"貨幣基礎\" in all versions, which is appropriate and commonly used in financial contexts. The term \"Table\" is translated as \"表\" in all translations, which aligns with the dictionary requirement.\nHowever, there are minor differences in punctuation and wording that affect fluency and consistency:\n1. **Punctuation:** The first junior translator uses a space between \"表\" and \"1\" (表 1), while the others use no space (表1). In Traditional Chinese, it is more common to write \"表1\" without a space, especially in formal or technical contexts. This is consistent with the other translations and is more natural in financial or academic writing.\n2. **Verb Choice:** The first, third, and fourth translations use \"包括\" (includes), while the third uses \"包含\" (contains). In this context, \"包括\" is more natural and commonly used in formal writing to introduce components of a larger whole.\n3. **Numerical Format:** The second junior translator uses \"表一\" (Table One), which is also acceptable but less common in formal or technical documents compared to the numeral \"表1.\" The latter is more concise and widely used in tables and lists.\n**Improvement Considerations:**\n- **Consistency:** The most consistent and natural choice is \"表1\" without a space, as seen in translations 3–6.\n- **Verb Choice:** \"包括\" is more natural in this context than \"包含.\"\n- **Punctuation and Style:** The use of parentheses and the numeral format should be consistent with formal financial or academic writing standards.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\n**貨幣基礎（表1）包括：**\n\n債務憑證，為三家發行紙幣銀行所發行的紙幣提供十足支持。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局持有的清算賬戶餘額的合共數額。\n\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及金管局堅定履行兌換承諾（CUs）來保持的。當港元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率強升至強方兌換範圍的7.75港元兌1美元時，金管局準備在收到要求後向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總餘額隨即擴展，推動港元利率下調，創造貨幣條件，使港元遠離強方上限，回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率疲弱至弱方兌換範圍的7.85港元兌1美元時，金管局準備在收到要求後向銀行買入港元。總餘額隨即收縮，推高港元利率，推動港元遠離弱方下限，保持在7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，以及本地經濟放緩，港元在2019年仍然穩定，並以暢順有序的方式進行交易。年初時，港元對美元的負息差擴大，吸引沽出港元換美元的套利交易活動，推動港元匯率接近弱方兌換範圍7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續轉弱，弱方兌換範圍最終在3月觸發了8次。其後，港元匯率維持在接近7.85的弱方兌換範圍內。自5月下旬起，規模龐大的首次公開招股活動、企業對派息的需求及半年結算帶來強大的港元需求，推動港元走強。雖然半年結算後港元一度回落，但自10月下旬起，港元重拾升勢，並在年底維持在兌換範圍的強方。這反映了部分與資本市場相關的需求，包括新股集資，以及因年底流動性收緊而平倉短倉的行為。整體而言，港元匯率市場在2019年運作正常。\n\n由於弱方結算價（CU）被觸發，總餘額（貼現窗前）及未償還的外匯基金債券（EFBNs）由2018年底的11,362億港元下跌至2019年底的11,330億港元（圖2）。在該年度內，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，在弱方結算價為7.85的情況下，應銀行的要求購入總額221億港元，導致總餘額（貼現窗前）由2018年底的764億港元減少至2019年底的543億港元。未償還的外匯基金債券在該年度內輕微增加，由1,0598億港元增至10,787億港元，反映根據既定慣例發行外匯基金債券以吸收外匯基金債券的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足由外匯儲備支持。截至2019年底，總餘額（貼現窗前）及未償還的外匯基金債券總額為11,330億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\nThe original English text is \"# Money market\". The junior translators have mostly translated this as \"貨幣市場\", which is the correct and standard translation for \"money market\" in Traditional Chinese. However, some translations include a \"#\" symbol before the term, which is not appropriate in this context. The \"#\" symbol is typically used in digital or social media contexts to denote a hashtag or a section heading, but it is not part of the actual translation of the term \"money market\".\nThe most accurate and natural translation is \"貨幣市場\", which is used by the first, third, fifth, and sixth junior translators. The second and fourth translators incorrectly included the \"#\" symbol before the term, which should be omitted for a proper translation.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of \"# Money market\" into Traditional Chinese is \"貨幣市場\", without the \"#\" symbol.\n\n2019年間，港元銀行間利率在較長期部分大致保持穩定，而短期利率則大致上升（圖3）。短期利率亦因與新股集資相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需要而經歷更多波動。自2018年4月以來總餘額的減少，可能導致港元銀行間利率對本地市場港元資金供需變化的敏感度提高。\n\n基準利率於2018年8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下調75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至2019年11月初的2.00%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次下調，總計75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。在11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日期間，基準利率設於2.00%之上，反映該年最後兩個月隔夜及一個月期香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）顯著上揚。因此，基準利率於2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整是根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式進行，該公式規定基準利率為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月HIBORs五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。在零售方面，多間零售銀行於10月底美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，將其最佳貸款利率下調12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數的折扣在首兩個月擴闊，大致跟隨港元對美元的息差變化，12個月期港元遠期點數在2月中達到約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著負的港元對美元息差收窄，港元遠期點數的折扣逐漸縮窄，並在年底轉為保費。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗借款在2019年減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元有所下降。\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出大幅貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在本年度社會事件的背景下，一些無根據的謠言懷疑聯匯制度及香港的金融穩定性，透過社交媒體流傳。香港金融管理局果斷積極地透過傳統及社交媒體駁斥謠言，以釋除公眾疑慮，重申聯匯制度將維持不變，香港亦不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，香港金融管理局亦發佈多篇文章，幫助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流動及利率前景。這些努力有效維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，正如全年市場有序運作所反映的那樣。政府亦穩固承諾支持聯匯制度。政府承諾的穩定性，以及港元作為支付手段和保值工具的公眾信心，亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步鞏固。在2019年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定其對聯匯制度的長期支持，認為聯匯制度仍是香港金融穩定的基石，並指出聯匯制度在透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架支持下，仍然是香港合適的匯率安排。\n\n一個穩健的銀行體系對 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系具有高度流動性且穩健，其流動性水平和資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、物業相關貸款及內地相關貸款的監管努力。與上一年相比，銀行總體流動性餘額較少，銀行普遍已加強流動性管理安排，並在日常資金頭寸管理方面更加積極。此外，香港金融管理局持續與銀行保持緊密對話，以確保市場流動性暢順回收，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的認購期前後及期間。本年度未見到任何結算阻塞的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且高效地運作。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一部分外匯基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2019年於109.9—112.1%的範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。在面對突發衝擊時，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）是外匯基金諮詢委員會的下屬委員會，負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2019年，CBC考慮了包括對LERS營運的事件研究、香港總結餘與利率之間的關係、提升及更靈活處理期權市場對LERS的觀點，以及未來首次公開招股對HIBOR的影響等議題。CBC就這些議題進行的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會營運報告，均已刊登於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究院（HKIMR），前稱香港貨幣研究院，致力於進行與政策相關的貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究工作。這一點反映在HKIMR研究人員及海外訪問學者所探討的廣泛主題，以及該院舉辦的會議及活動中。HKIMR與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦以政策為重點的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持與香港金融管理局、香港及區內相關的重要政策議題研究項目。\n\n2019年，香港國際金融研究中心舉辦了14位研究學者，刊登了17篇工作論文，並舉辦了11場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。它亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆中國經濟國際研討會，題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融中心研究院（HKIMR）、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。該研討會提供一個全球級論壇，讓來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家，討論與內地金融部門在因應金融改革引入的變化及內地經濟發展所面臨的風險相關的議題。\n第十屆中國經濟國際研討會，題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融中心研究院（HKIMR）、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。該研討會提供一個全球級論壇，讓來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家，討論與內地金融部門在因應金融改革引入的變化及內地經濟發展所面臨的風險相關的議題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2019年仍然穩健及穩定，儘管受到全球及本地經濟體轉弱所帶來的逆風影響。感謝業界的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間繼續正常運作。採取了措施以確保對公眾造成的不便降至最低。在該年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將監管重點放在授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。鑒於網絡威脅日益增加，以及業界對科技的依賴不斷增長，HKMA加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，HKMA精簡了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了數字金融服務的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度進行第四輪互評的結果。整體而言，該制度被評估為合規且有效，特別肯定銀行業對風險的良好理解，以及香港金融管理局在AML\/CFT方面基於風險的監管工作。香港金融管理局繼續參與公私合作，進行有關訛騙及洗錢的情報分享，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2019年批出（牌照）予8間虛擬銀行，並公布了一個三個階段的方案，以促進香港綠色和可持續銀行業的發展。香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界保持緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程，並推行能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，國際監管標準在本地的落實工作取得了實質性進展，包括資本充足率標準、資訊披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦繼續其工作，確保授權機構將有一套可信的處置機制，包括實施有關吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升授權機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營業務的方式，會影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，亦可能以混亂的方式失敗。作為監管當局，貨幣當局在確保銀行對衝擊具有韌性，並能在面對危機時回應以恢復其地位，從而發揮關鍵作用，最終幫助預防失敗。貨幣當局負責香港銀行的審慎監管，其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構合稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣當局亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，亦非香港審慎監管框架設計用以確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣當局作為處置當局，致力確保在認可機構變得不可持續時，其失敗可以以有序方式處理。為此，香港已設立針對金融機構的處置機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局為認可機構的處置當局。為確保香港的處置機制有效運作，制定處置立法及政策標準、進行處置規劃以移除影響認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及提升貨幣當局處理失敗認可機構的運作能力，至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，貨幣當局採用國際協調一致的方式。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 監督活動概述\nReview and Reasoning:\nThe original English text is \"# Overview of supervisory activities\". The junior translators have provided several variations, with the main differences being the use of \"概述\" vs. \"概覽\" and the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol.\n\"概述\" and \"概覽\" are both acceptable translations for \"overview\", with \"概述\" being slightly more common in formal contexts. \"概覽\" is also correct but may be used more in the context of a visual or structural overview.\nThe use of \"#\" in translations 2, 4, and 5 is unnecessary, as it is not part of the original English text and does not serve a functional purpose in the translation. It may be a carryover from the original formatting or an attempt to mimic the original structure, but it is not appropriate in a formal translation.\n\"監察活動\" in translation 5 is a slight variation, using \"監察\" instead of \"監督\". While both terms are related, \"監督\" is more commonly used in the context of \"supervisory activities\" in formal or administrative contexts.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would be \"監督活動概述\", which is concise, accurate, and appropriate for the context. It avoids unnecessary symbols and uses the most common and appropriate term for \"overview\" in this context.\n\n2019年進行了196場非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評分評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動更強風險治理的一部分，與認可機構的董事會或董事會級委員會舉行了26場會議。此外，HKMA、認可機構及其外部審計師之間共舉行了32場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行定期現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為更高風險範疇的主題審查。當年共進行了405項現場檢查及主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一重大重點在於科技風險及營運風險管理。HKMA亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及落實巴塞爾資本充足率框架的現場檢查及主題審查數目。同時，專門團隊對持牌機構在證券、投資產品、保險及與強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場檢查及主題審查。\n\n表1包含香港金融管理局（HKMA）2019年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n信貸風險監督、信用風險監管、信貸風險監控等翻譯均在語義上接近原文，但「信貸風險監管」更符合金融領域常用術語，語感自然且專業。因此選擇「信貸風險監管」作為最佳翻譯。\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2019年銀行貸款增幅溫和。總貸款額增長6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外地區的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n截至2019年底，內地相關貸款增至4,564億港元，增長7.4%（表3）。\n\nAIs的資產品質仍然健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年底的0.51%輕微下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。就銀行業整體而言，分類貸款比率輕微增加，從0.55%上升至0.57%。具體而言，在與內地相關的貸款方面，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年的0.63%增加至2019年的0.79%，根據歷史標準仍處於低位。就銀行業整體而言，該比率從一年前的0.55%增加至0.75%。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加大了監管力度，確保認可機構（AIs）在不確定的經濟環境下繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。壓力測試已加強，以涵蓋更全面的風險範疇，並採用更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行一般擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為嚴重的衝擊。針對性及主題性的檢查亦進行，以評估認可機構在不同範疇的信貸風險管理實踐，例如向從事高風險業務的企業提供貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的擔保貸款。鑒於中小企業（SMEs）在經濟下行時更可能面臨更大的挑戰，香港金融管理局於10月設立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，期望鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企業的融資需要。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行業對房地產市場逆轉的韌性，自2009年起因香港金融管理局（HKMA）引入的八輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施而大幅加強。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2019年12月的53%。新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%，降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監督\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Supervision of operational and technology risk.\" The task is to translate this into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese, ensuring that the translation is grammatically correct, culturally appropriate, and stylistically consistent.\nLooking at the translations provided by the junior translators:\n1. **\"營運及科技風險之監控\"** – This translation is grammatically correct and uses the term \"監控\" (monitoring), which is appropriate. However, \"之\" is somewhat formal and may not be the most natural choice in this context.\n2. **\"營運及科技風險的監管\"** – This is also grammatically correct. \"監管\" (supervision\/monitoring) is a good fit, and the use of \"的\" is natural in this context. However, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary and should be omitted.\n3. **\"監督作業與科技風險\"** – This translation is slightly awkward. \"作業\" (operations) is not the most precise term for \"operational\" in this context. \"營運\" is more commonly used in business and risk management contexts.\n4. **\"操作與科技風險管理\"** – This translation uses \"操作\" (operation), which is less precise than \"營運\" in the context of risk management. Also, \"管理\" (management) is not the best fit for \"supervision.\"\n5. **\"營運與科技風險的監督\"** – This is a strong translation. It uses \"營運\" and \"監督\" appropriately, and the structure is natural. However, the inclusion of the \"#\" symbol is unnecessary.\n6. **\"營運及科技風險監督\"** – This is concise and natural. It omits the \"#\" symbol and uses \"監督\" (supervision), which is appropriate. However, the structure is slightly more direct than the original English, which may be acceptable depending on the context.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use the most appropriate terminology. \"營運及科技風險監督\" is the most concise and natural option, but it lacks the possessive structure that might be more common in formal contexts. A slightly more formal and natural version would be \"營運及科技風險的監督,\" which includes the possessive particle \"的\" and omits the unnecessary \"#\" symbol.\nThus, the improved translation is:\n**營運及科技風險的監督**\n\n香港金融管理局採用三個階段的方法來實施網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有重大銀行，已於2018年完成。第二及第三階段所涵蓋的其餘機構亦已按計劃大致完成評估。鑒於過去幾年的經驗，香港金融管理局亦已開展對CFI的全面檢討，以進一步優化該計劃。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了修訂後的監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊，主題為「電子銀行風險管理」。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。香港金融管理局亦發佈了一套關於使用人工智能的高層原則，以提供指引給業界。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，香港金融管理局一直與業界保持緊密對話，以監察社會事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。香港金融管理局亦迅速採取行動，駁斥那些企圖削弱公眾對銀行系統信心的惡意謠言。由於銀行業界的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施很快恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便亦被減至最低。鑒於社會事件帶來的營運風險上升，銀行被要求採取額外的預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理之監督\n\n在該年內，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為金融機構流動性壓力測試計劃及應急融資管理的穩健性。香港金融管理局亦評估金融機構遵守有關流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）計算的監管要求，以確保計算所運用輸入數據的謹慎性及準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在該領域的風險管理實踐。考慮到倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止刊登，香港金融管理局提醒人工智能機構做好轉向替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監察其對過渡的準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）對授權機構（AIs）的反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）系統進行風險為本的監管。在本年度內，進行了18次現場檢查及61次非現場審查，包括針對私人銀行及新技術應用治理的主題性審查。HKMA與業界分享從針對AIs在中小企（SMEs）應用風險為本的AML\/CFT控制措施的主題性審查中所得的觀察結果及最佳實踐，以協助AIs採用適當的中小企開戶程序及服務提供方式。\n\n# 金融行動特別工作組（FATF）互認評估（ME）報告：香港\n\n2019年香港金融管理局（HKMA）及香港整體反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）制度的一大亮點，是金融行動特別工作組（FATF）於9月發布的香港互評報告（ME Report）。該報告代表FATF對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪互評（ME）至今的最佳整體成果之一。在香港對其AML\/CFT制度成效的評估中，香港在11項「即時成效」評級中獲得六項「重大」評級，並在互評的技術合規方面取得高分。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局（HKMA）以風險為本的反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法給予正面評估，指出香港金融管理局對銀行業中的洗錢／恐怖融資（ML\/TF）風險有良好了解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦對銀行業的共同反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）努力給予正面評估，例如較大的人工智能（AI）機構增加使用數據分析，大部分可疑交易報告由人工智能（AI）機構提交，以及該行業積極參與訛騙及洗錢情報行動小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項範疇的改善，包括對一些更高風險範疇的了解，例如外國貪污及稅務罪行，以及培育如SVF等領域。有關工作已經開始應對這些建議；香港金融管理局於七月刊登了修訂後的ML\/TF風險評估，針對SVF範疇，並已開始進行私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的主題性現場檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

總覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位，香港金融管理局投放巨大努力，實施於2017年9月公布的七項智慧銀行倡議，旨在促進金融科技在銀行及支付行業的發展與應用。這些倡議在本年度的關鍵進展包括：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation Quality and Fluency:**  \n   All translations are generally fluent and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, some translations use slightly awkward phrasing or word order that affects readability. For example, the phrase “以促進金融科技在銀行及支付業的發展及應用為目標” in Translation 6 is grammatically correct but less natural than alternatives.\n2. **Grammar and Vocabulary:**  \n   Most translations are grammatically sound. However, some use redundant or overly formal expressions. For instance, “大力推動實施” in Translation 5 is more verbose than necessary, while “投放巨大努力” is more concise and natural.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:**  \n   The use of terms like “金融科技中心” (fintech hub) and “智慧銀行” (smart banking) is appropriate and commonly used in Chinese media and official documents. The term “倡議” (initiatives) is also suitable, though “計劃” (plan) or “措施” (measures) could be alternatives depending on context.\n4. **Dictionary Compliance:**  \n   All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms:  \n   - “implementing” → “實施”  \n   - “great” → “巨大”  \n   - “progress” → “進展”  \n   - “puts” → “投放”  \n   - “facilitate” → “促進”  \n   - “effort” → “努力”  \n   - “strengthen” → “加強”  \n   - “2017” → “2017年”  \n   - “included” → “包括”  \n   - “September” → “9月”  \n   - “year” → “年”  \n   - “announced” → “公布”  \n5. **Improvements:**  \n   - Use of “倡議” (initiatives) is consistent and appropriate.  \n   - “投放巨大努力” is more natural than “投入巨大努力.”  \n   - “促進金融科技在銀行及支付行業的發展與應用” is concise and natural.  \n   - “關鍵進展” is more precise than “重要進展” or “主要進展.”  \nBased on these considerations, the best translation combines clarity, fluency, and dictionary compliance, resulting in the final version provided.\n\n- 擴展轉數快（FPS）的應用；  \n- 促進開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架第一階段及第二階段在銀行業的落實；  \n- 進一步提升金融科技研究與人才發展；  \n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；授予八間虛擬銀行牌照；  \n- 促進業界日益增加使用金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）2.0 來推出金融科技計劃；以及  \n- 透過「銀行業務更容易」計劃進一步促進監管科技（Regtech）的應用。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局的銀行部門一同發揮關鍵作用，推動這些倡議的落實。\n\n香港在促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，憑藉股票通及債券通這兩大方案，香港擁有無與倫比的內地市場接觸渠道。根據過去一年債券通註冊投資者數目及每日成交額增長兩倍的數據，可見其成效顯著。債券通及股票通亦進一步引入改進措施，為國際投資者提供更多便利與靈活性，以投資內地證券。香港金融管理局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索並實施一系列金融便利措施，讓香港居民能更便捷地跨過邊境，在粵港澳大灣區（GBA）內接觸金融及銀行服務，包括一個預期中的兩向理財通方案。香港持續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的堅定立足點。根據國際清算銀行（BIS）每三年一次的外匯（FX）及衍生工具市場成交額調查，香港繼續是全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續投入努力以開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港基金業務的發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，提供更為利好的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金設立。為推動香港成為綠色金融、基礎設施投資與融資及企業財務中心（CTCs）的樞紐，舉辦了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳推廣行動。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院（AoF）於6月設立，以培育金融領導人才並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管界，香港金融管理局在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金融管理局曾擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，直至2019年8月31日。現時，香港金融管理局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）監管與落實小組（SIG）主席，以及東亞及太平洋中央銀行高級管理人員會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）主席。香港金融管理局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）非銀行監測專家小組（NMEG）主席。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的角色奠定了穩固的根基。2019年，四個銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央結算及交收系統（CMU）及香港交易存管庫（HKTR）取得100%的系統可用率，超越了99.95%的目標。CMU透過與兩家內地中央證券存管機構設立的賬戶，協助進行債券通北向交易的結算，並代表相關CMU會員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快作為港元即時支付系統的延伸，使公眾能全天候跨不同銀行及儲值設施（SVFs）進行即時零售資金轉帳及付款，其在首年的運作順暢。用戶對該設施的採用率持續上升，體現在至2019年底已達四百萬登記數目及交易量增長兩倍。轉數快為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定並監察共六個零售支付系統（RPSs）。香港金融管理局亦於5月發出了兩項新的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照，使SVF持牌機構的數目增至18間。SVF持牌機構於該年度繼續積極推出新產品及服務，以多元化客戶選擇並提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行方案\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2017年9月公布了七項智慧銀行倡議，旨在協助銀行業取得更高標準的運作，並擁抱銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。在該年內，這些倡議的實施取得了大量進展，並推動香港金融科技生態系統的轉型。\n\n# 更快的支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出的轉數快，是香港在數碼時代金融基礎設施發展上的重大里程碑。轉數快透過向公眾及企業提供高效及方便的支付服務，進一步推動香港電子支付的採用。自轉數快推出以來，參與服務供應商的數目已增加至30間銀行及11間SVF，至2019年底新增了9間銀行及1間SVF。\n\n轉數快的用量亦持續增長。截至2019年12月31日，轉數快記錄了四百萬宗登記數目（圖1），並處理了4,400萬宗交易，涉及總金額達港幣748.5億元及人民幣17億元。2019年12月，平均每日成交額達到168,000宗交易，價值港幣24億元及人民幣3,800萬元（圖2），相比2018年10月其首個運作月的51,000宗交易。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：  \n- 截至2019年12月31日，登記數目為4百萬  \n- 截至2019年12月31日，交易數目為44百萬  \n- 2019年12月平均每日成交額為港幣24億及人民幣3,800萬，交易筆數為168,000筆\n\n香港金融管理局與業界合作，擴展轉數快的使用範圍，從個人對個人付款擴展至賬單付款及其他商戶付款。例如，已作出改進，使商戶能夠使用不同類型的代理識別碼，並透過二維碼接受部分或過多支付。已制定技術規範，以促進從商業手機應用程式啟動手機銀行或SVF電子錢包手機應用程式（app），用於轉數快支付。這將大大改善用戶透過轉數快使用移動設備進行商戶和商業支付的體驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與相關政府部門緊密合作，協助他們利用轉數快接受公眾繳費。自11月1日起，稅務局、差餉物業估價署及水務署發出的帳單均印有轉數快二維碼，讓公眾可透過支援的流動銀行應用程式或SVF電子錢包應用程式輕易掃描二維碼進行繳費。香港金融管理局將繼續與各項政府部門及公營機構合作，探索其他潛在應用場景，以使公眾能更方便地透過轉數快進行繳費。\n\n為提高公眾對轉數快的認識，香港金管局推出一系列新的教育及宣傳資料，例如用於電視及電台廣播的公眾利益公告，以及用於數碼平台的視頻和電子橫額。香港金管局亦參與貿易博覽會，向中小企及企業推動轉數快。各項參與轉數快的銀行及SVFs推出推廣活動，並提供誘因，以鼓勵客戶登記使用轉數快，並用其進行資金轉帳及繳費。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局委聘了多個行業組織及機構，提供關於轉數快的簡報，以介紹其功能，以及它可能為不同企業在收款及付款方面帶來的潛在福利。\n\n政府已採用轉數快進行稅款、差餉及政府地租和水費的繳費。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the term \"轉數快\" for FPS, and the structure is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"差餉\" is not a standard term for \"rates\" in this context; \"差餉\" typically refers to \"poll tax\" or \"house tax,\" not \"rates\" as in local taxes. Also, \"政府地租\" is repeated unnecessarily.  \n   - **Improvement:** Replace \"差餉\" with \"地稅\" or \"地方稅\" and remove the redundant \"政府地租.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"轉數快\" correctly and the sentence is concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"地租\" is used instead of \"rates,\" which is not accurate. Also, \"等費用\" is vague and less precise than the original.  \n   - **Improvement:** Replace \"地租\" with \"地稅\" and remove \"等費用\" for clarity.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"轉數快\" and includes \"系統\" which adds clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Repeats \"政府地租\" and uses \"FpS\" instead of the correct \"FPS\" (case-sensitive). Also, \"地租\" is used instead of \"rates.\"  \n   - **Improvement:** Correct the term to \"FPS\" and replace \"地租\" with \"地稅.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" correctly and the structure is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"地稅\" is not the best term for \"rates.\" Also, \"地稅\" is not commonly used in this context.  \n   - **Improvement:** Replace \"地稅\" with \"差餉\" or \"地方稅\" for better accuracy.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"轉數快\" and the sentence is fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"稅項\" is slightly less precise than \"稅款.\" Also, \"水費\" is correct, but \"政府水費\" is redundant.  \n   - **Improvement:** Use \"稅款\" and remove \"政府\" before \"水費.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and the structure is clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"法案支付\" is incorrect; \"Bill\" here refers to \"payment\" or \"bill\" as in \"invoice,\" not \"bill\" as in \"legislation.\" Also, \"地稅\" is not the best term for \"rates.\"  \n   - **Improvement:** Replace \"法案支付\" with \"繳費\" and \"地稅\" with \"差餉\" or \"地方稅.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should use \"轉數快\" for FPS, \"稅款\" for \"taxes,\" \"差餉\" for \"rates,\" and \"地租\" for \"rent.\" It should avoid redundancy and ensure clarity. The phrase \"進行稅款、差餉及政府地租和水費的繳費\" is concise, accurate, and uses the correct terms in context.\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n香港金融管理局繼續根據開放API框架的四階段方法，促進銀行業發展及採用開放API。在第一階段，20間零售銀行於1月開放超過500個開放API端點，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。在第二階段，銀行於10月開放超過300個API，以支持銀行產品及服務的應用。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n在貿易融資方面，首個有關連接eTradeConnect與we.trade的試驗研究已在本年第一季度完成。11月，香港銀行同業結算有限公司的子公司與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所（PBoC）簽署了《諒解備忘錄》（MoU），以進行有關連接eTradeConnect與PBoC貿易融資平台的試驗研究，為香港和中國內地的企業提供更方便的貿易融資服務。\n\n關於中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC），香港金融管理局與泰國央行開展了一項名為「Inthanon-LionRock」的聯合研究項目，以研究CBDC在跨境支付中的應用，期望促進香港與泰國銀行之間的港幣-泰銖支付對支付（PVP）。\n\n香港金融管理局金融基礎設施執行總監彭志豪先生（左起首個），與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所所長穆长春先生（右起首個），一同見證《諒解備忘錄》的簽署儀式，該備忘錄旨在進行試驗，以連接eTradeConnect與中國人民銀行貿易融資平台。該《諒解備忘錄》由香港貿易融資平台有限公司首席執行官唐慧星女士（左起第二個）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長迪革先生（右起第二個）簽署。\n\n關於人工智慧（AI），香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一項研究，探討人工智慧技術在香港銀行業的應用。一份涵蓋整個行業的人工智慧調查的關鍵發現於11月刊登，隨後在12月發佈了題為「以人工智慧重塑銀行業」的完整報告。\n\n報告《以人工智慧重塑銀行業》於12月刊登。\n\n一份事實簡報已刊登，用以突出從有關香港銀行業使用人工智能的調查中得出的關鍵事實和數字。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the dictionary terms \"刊登\" for \"published\", \"事實\" for \"facts\", and \"數字\" for \"figures\".\n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"這些數字和事實是從關於在香港銀行業使用認可機構的調查中得出的\" is awkward and redundant. It incorrectly translates \"AI\" as \"認可機構\", which is a regulatory term, not a synonym for AI. This is a critical error.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"刊登\" and \"事實\" correctly. The structure is more concise.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Again, \"認可機構\" is incorrectly used for \"AI\", which is a major issue. The translation lacks clarity in the relationship between the survey and the facts\/figures.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"人工智能\" for \"AI\", which is correct. The structure is fluent and natural.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"事實摘要\" is not an exact match for \"fact sheet\", though it is close. The term \"主要數字和事實\" is slightly off from \"key facts and figures\".\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"刊登\" and \"數字\" correctly.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly uses \"認可機構\" for \"AI\" again. The sentence is incomplete and lacks clarity.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"人工智能\" for \"AI\" correctly. The structure is natural and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"資料單張\" is a less common term than \"事實簡報\" for \"fact sheet\", though still acceptable.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"人工智能\" for \"AI\" correctly. The structure is natural and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: \"關鍵事實和數字\" is slightly less precise than \"key facts and figures\", but it is acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"人工智能\" for \"AI\" (not \"認可機構\").\n- Use \"刊登\" for \"published\".\n- Use \"事實\" for \"facts\" and \"數字\" for \"figures\".\n- Use \"事實簡報\" for \"fact sheet\", which is the most natural and commonly used term.\n- Maintain a clear and fluent structure that accurately reflects the original meaning.\nBased on these considerations, the improved translation is as follows:  \n一份事實簡報已刊登，用以突出從有關香港銀行業使用人工智能的調查中得出的關鍵事實和數字。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作，推行「金融科技事業加速器計劃2.0」，以培育年輕人才在事業發展的各個階段。去年超過220名學生從該計劃中受惠。\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作，推行「金融科技事業加速器計劃2.0」，以培育年輕人才在事業發展的各個階段。去年超過220名學生從該計劃中受惠。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%.

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場在2019年表現優於預期，因主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的影響大於對全球增長放緩及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第4季經歷重大調整後反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上漲。在這樣有利的環境下，金管局在2019年記錄了2,622億港元的投資收入，相當於6.6%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n在評估各項翻譯時，可以看到「交易所基金」是較為常見且符合語境的翻譯，用於指代在證券交易所上市交易的投資基金。其他翻譯如「基金交換」、「結匯基金」、「契約基金」、「兌換基金」等，雖然在字面上可能與「Exchange Fund」有所關聯，但卻未能準確反映其作為一種投資工具的本質。因此，選擇「交易所基金」作為最終翻譯，既符合語境，也符合常見的金融術語使用習慣。\n\n證券交易所基金的首要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的交換價值。該基金亦可被運用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助香港維持其國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長（FS）所轉授的授權，並在授權條款內，就證券交易所基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 管理外匯基金\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title, **\"MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\"**, is a formal and technical heading, likely referring to the administration or governance of a specific fund related to foreign exchange.\nAmong the translations provided by junior translators:\n1. **# 結匯基金管理** – This translation uses “結匯” (foreign exchange settlement), which is more specific than the general term “exchange fund.” While it may be contextually appropriate in some cases, it is not the most accurate or general translation for “exchange fund.”\n2. **# 基金管理** – This is overly generic, as it simply means “fund management” without specifying the type of fund. It lacks the specificity of “exchange fund.”\n3. **# 外匯基金的管理** – This is a direct and accurate translation of “management of the exchange fund.” It clearly conveys the intended meaning and is grammatically correct in Traditional Chinese.\n4. **# 財政儲備基金管理** – This translates to “management of fiscal reserves,” which is not equivalent to “exchange fund.” It introduces a different concept and is therefore inaccurate.\n5. **# 交易所基金的管理** – This translates to “management of exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” which is a completely different financial instrument and not relevant to the original term.\n6. **# 管理外匯基金** – This is a direct translation of “management of the exchange fund,” and it is grammatically correct. However, it places the verb before the noun, which is less common in formal titles in Traditional Chinese, where the noun typically comes first.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be **# 外匯基金的管理**, as it directly and clearly conveys the meaning of the original English title. It is grammatically correct, culturally appropriate, and maintains the formal tone expected in such contexts. While **# 管理外匯基金** is also correct, it is slightly less conventional for a title. Therefore, **# 外匯基金的管理** is the best choice.\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已為證券交易所基金設立以下投資目標：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms: \"set\" is translated as \"設立\" and \"following\" is not used in a way that requires translation (it is part of the phrase \"the following investment objectives\"). The structure is natural and grammatically correct.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** incorrectly places \"隨着\" (which means \"with\" or \"as\") in the middle of the sentence, making it awkward and semantically unclear. \"隨着\" is not appropriate here and does not match the intended meaning of \"the following.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** misidentifies \"Exchange Fund\" as \"香港儲備基金\" (Hong Kong Reserve Fund), which is not accurate. The correct term should be \"證券交易所基金\" or \"外匯基金\" depending on context, but not \"儲備基金.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** incorrectly uses \"隨着\" again and misplaces it as \"隨着投資目標,\" which is grammatically incorrect and semantically confusing. Also, \"外匯基金\" is a possible translation for \"Exchange Fund,\" but the structure is flawed.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** uses \"聯匯基金\" (Linked Exchange Fund), which is not a standard term for \"Exchange Fund.\" It also introduces a non-standard name \"聯匯諮詢委員會\" instead of \"EFAC,\" which is misleading.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** again misuses \"隨着\" and omits the object \"for the Exchange Fund,\" making the sentence incomplete and unclear.\n**Improved Translation:**\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已為證券交易所基金設立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；  \n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎在任何時候都由高度流動性的美元計價資產十足支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，取得投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長線購買力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮發行機構的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n這句翻譯整體語意通順，語法正確，但存在幾個問題。首先，「take」應根據詞典翻譯為「選持倉盤」，但這句中卻翻譯為「考慮」，與詞典不符。其次，「full」應翻譯為「十足」，但這句中卻翻譯為「充分」，也與詞典不符。最後，「incorporated」應翻譯為「註冊」，但這句中卻翻譯為「納入」，同樣與詞典不符。\n這些目標選持倉盤十足考慮到匯換基金的法定宗旨，並註冊於基金的組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n這句翻譯正確使用了詞典中的翻譯，但語意上略顯生硬，特別是「選持倉盤十足考慮到」這部分，語序不自然，影響了整體的流暢度。\n這些目標選持倉盤十足地考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置中。\n這句翻譯正確使用了詞典中的翻譯，語意通順，語法正確，但「選持倉盤十足地考慮了」這部分語序略顯不自然，影響了整體的流暢度。\n這些目標充分考慮了基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n這句翻譯語意通順，語法正確，但未正確使用詞典中的翻譯，特別是「take」、「full」、「incorporated」這三個詞，均未按照詞典翻譯。\n這些目標選持倉盤十足的考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n這句翻譯正確使用了詞典中的翻譯，語意通順，語法正確，但「選持倉盤十足的考慮」這部分語序略顯不自然，影響了整體的流暢度。\n這些目標十足考慮了結匯基金的法定宗旨，並已註冊於投資組合結構及基金的目標資產配置之中。\n這句翻譯正確使用了詞典中的翻譯，語意通順，語法正確，但「十足考慮了」這部分語序略顯不自然，影響了整體的流暢度。\n經過上述分析，最佳的翻譯應該正確使用詞典中的翻譯，語意通順，語法正確，語序自然。因此，最佳的翻譯應該是：\n這些目標選持倉盤十足考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n這些目標選持倉盤十足考慮了交易基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n大致上，外匯基金擁有兩大主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動性的美元計價資產，以根據貨幣局制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保本並維持其資產的長線購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以審慎及漸進的方式，將外匯基金投資的一部分分散至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長線增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限設為外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一，加上與LTGP掛鈎的未來基金及外匯基金子公司投資的相關部分。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年設立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購得。由於其獨特性質，此投資組合並未包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與外匯基金的安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP表現掛鈎，但未來基金為重大例外，其利率則同時參考投資組合配置，與IP及LTGP掛鈎。截至2019年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置決定為基礎：戰略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑒於交易所基金的投資目標所作出的長線資產配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會戰術性地配置，以爭取取得高於基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然基準與追蹤誤差上限是由財政司與儲備基金諮詢委員會磋商後決定，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的允許範圍則是由香港金融管理局根據授權作出並設立。在戰術性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持倉盤，以利用短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2018年8月設立了外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括一組投資於全球定息市場的投資組合，以及各項實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具輔助投資組合。\n\n# 運用外部經理\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除了內部管理資產外，亦聘請外部基金經理管理約29%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是汲取市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續回報，並利用多樣化且互補的投資風格，爭取他們在市場洞察及投資技術方面的專業知識。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及託管費用、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的內容，但在語感、用詞選擇與語法流暢度上仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「基金管理費及託管費用」、「扣繳及其他稅項」等，符合財務語境。唯一可微調之處為「並可能每年有所變動」，語氣略顯生硬，可稍作潤飾。\n2. **第二譯文**：用詞較為現代，如「稅費」比「稅項」更常見於日常語境，但「稅費」在財務文件中可能不如「稅項」正式。此外，「波動」一詞雖正確，但語氣略顯口語。\n3. **第三譯文**：「扣留稅」為誤譯，正確應為「扣繳稅」或「預扣稅」，與「withholding taxes」對應。此外，「每年可能波動」語序略顯不自然。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「扣留稅」為誤譯，應修正為「扣繳稅」或「預扣稅」。此外，「其他稅項」與「其他稅款」語義略有差異，需統一。\n5. **第五譯文**：「預扣和其他稅款」語義正確，但「預扣」與「扣繳」在財務語境中略有差異，需視上下文選擇最合適的詞彙。\n6. **第六譯文**：整體語句流暢，用詞準確，「逐年波動」比「每年波動」更符合財務文件的正式語氣，但「使用外部管理人所產生的費用」語序略顯繁複，可稍作簡化。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「withholding taxes」正確翻譯為「扣繳稅」或「預扣稅」，避免誤譯為「扣留稅」。\n- 統一「稅項」與「稅款」的使用，視語境選擇最合適的詞彙。\n- 調整語序，使句子更符合中文財務文件的正式語氣。\n- 使用「每年有所變動」或「逐年波動」等更自然的表達方式。\n**最終翻譯：**\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及託管費用、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n# 風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規性\n所有翻譯都大致正確，但第六位翻譯員將「compliance」翻譯為「合規性」，這在語法上是正確的，但與「風險管理」搭配時，「合規」更常見且更自然。此外，第四位翻譯員在標題前加上了「#」符號，與原文格式一致，但若非特別要求，通常在正式翻譯中不會保留此符號。因此，最佳翻譯應為「風險管理與合規」，不帶符號，以保持專業性和一致性。\n\n投資環境日益複雜，凸顯風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合，均已制定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並對遵守指引和法規的情況進行緊密監察。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估亦已加強，以支持香港金管局（HKMA）投資多元化程度的提高。風險控制工具被用於在正常和不利的市場條件下評估市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使香港金管局能夠評估如何最佳地運用內部和外部管理者的投資技巧。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素併入交易所基金在公眾及私人市場投資的投資過程，以推動負責任投資（RI）。\n\n在公眾市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）實施與過程相關及與投資相關的措施。香港金融管理局所採取的與過程相關措施之一，是採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任擁有原則》（PRO），以幫助投資者決定如何最佳地滿足其對香港上市公司的投資所產生的所有權責任。在管理發行基金方面，香港金融管理局已制定內部指引，涵蓋外部基金管理人的甄選、委任及監督過程，並納入環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素。香港金融管理局所委任的外部基金管理人，就管理其香港股市及內地活躍股市組合的投資而言，須根據「遵守或解釋」的原則恪守PRO；而委任管理香港金融管理局在成熟市場股市組合的外部基金管理人，則須遵守國際認可的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦已融入香港金融管理局內部管理的債券投資之信貸風險分析中。\n\n至於公眾市場的環境、社會及管治（ESG）投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2015年起投資於綠色債券，作為此市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司管理的共同貸款組合計劃，該計劃重點關注新興市場的可持續投資。展望未來，HKMA將繼續增長其綠色債券組合，或透過直接投資，或投資於綠色債券基金。HKMA亦計劃在股權投資中構建以ESG為主題的投資策略，採納ESG股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用主動股權經理，這些經理在其投資決定中應用ESG因素。\n\n在私人市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）會在其盡職調查過程中檢視一般合夥人的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策與實踐。特別是，在所有長期一般合夥（LTGP）投資中，ESG風險評估會作為盡職調查的強制性部分進行。對於LTGP，香港金融管理局投資具有可持續特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，香港金融管理局在能源領域的直接投資與共同投資中投資於可再生能源，並在其房地產組合中投資於具有綠色及可持續特點的綠色建築物和倉庫。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續尋找具有可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資中將綠色認證作為重要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將緊密監察環境、社會及管治（ESG）標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資流程。此過程透過與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作而得以推進。特別是，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡議平台，香港金融管理局預期將參與制定ESG最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦為FCLTGlobal的成員，FCLTGlobal是一個非牟利組織，透過舉辦研討會和研究，致力於鼓勵企業及投資決策採納更長遠的焦點。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n如欲了解更多關於香港金融管理局（HKMA）的RI政策框架的細則，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管各譯文在整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文的意思，但在語法、用詞、語序及語感方面仍存在一些可改進之處。以下為具體評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯文**：使用「我們-中國」來翻譯「US-China」不正確，應為「美中」或「中美」。此外，「得益於主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策的支持」語序略顯生硬，可調整為更自然的語序。\n2. **第二譯文**：整體語感自然，用詞準確，語序合理，是目前最接近理想翻譯的一個版本。但「首三個季度」與「首個三季度」語感略有差異，建議統一為「首三個季度」。\n3. **第三譯文**：語感自然，用詞準確，語序合理，與第二譯文相近，但「仍屬良好」語感略顯口語化，可調整為「仍屬良好」或「仍表現良好」。\n4. **第四譯文**：語感自然，用詞準確，語序合理，與第二譯文相近，但「在收益率略有反彈的情況下」語序略顯冗長，可簡化為「在收益率略為反彈的背景下」。\n5. **第五譯文**：使用「經濟成長減速」與「主要國家政府債券」語感略顯不自然，建議使用「經濟增長放緩」與「主要政府債券」。\n6. **第六譯文**：語感自然，用詞準確，語序合理，但「在2019年首個三季度債券價格上漲」語序略顯生硬，建議調整為「在2019年首三個季度債券價格上漲」。\n**改進建議**：在語感自然、語序合理、用詞準確的前提下，可結合各譯文的優點，進行語序與語感的優化，使整體翻譯更符合傳統中文的語感與語法。\n---\n儘管對全球經濟增長放緩及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂，2019年全球金融市場在主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的支持下表現良好。隨着2018年第4季出現重大調整，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場方面，主要政府債券收益率在2019年首三個季度顯著下跌，債券價格因此上漲。儘管在收益率略為反彈的背景下，第4季債券價格回落，但整體而言，2019年債券市場的收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各不相同。由於中美貿易摩擦升溫，人民幣在第三季下跌了3.8%，但在第四季鑒於貿易摩擦緩和，人民幣收復了部分較早前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然英鎊在第三季因無協議脫歐風險增加而下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季對脫歐問題的明朗化，英鎊最終大幅反彈，對美元升值了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# The Exchange Fund’s performance.\" The key term here is \"Exchange Fund,\" which must be translated according to the dictionary provided. The dictionary lists only one entry: {'’': ['’']}, which appears to be an error or placeholder. However, based on the context and the translations provided by junior translators, it is clear that \"Exchange Fund\" refers to a specific financial entity, likely the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, commonly known as the \"外匯基金\" (Exchange Fund) in Traditional Chinese.\nAmong the junior translators' attempts:\n1. **\"基金的表現\"** – This is overly generic and lacks specificity. It simply means \"The fund's performance\" without identifying which fund.\n2. **\"聯匯基金表現\"** – \"聯匯\" (Linked Exchange) is not a standard term for the Hong Kong Exchange Fund.\n3. **\"交易所基金的表現\"** – This translates to \"Exchange-traded fund's performance,\" which is a different concept altogether and not accurate for \"Exchange Fund.\"\n4. **\"外匯基金的表現\"** – This is the most accurate and appropriate translation. \"外匯基金\" directly corresponds to \"Exchange Fund\" and is the standard term used in Hong Kong for the Exchange Fund.\n5. **\"外匯基金的表現\"** – Same as the fourth translation, but without the hashtag.\n6. **\"匯風盈餘基金的表現\"** – This is a creative but incorrect translation. \"匯風盈餘基金\" does not correspond to any known fund and is not a standard term.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and use the standard term for the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, which is \"外匯基金.\" The hashtag \"#\" is retained as in the original, and the translation should be natural and fluent in Traditional Chinese. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is:\n**# 外匯基金的表現**\n\n外匯基金於2019年記錄了2,622億港元的投資收益。這包括1,145億港元的債券收益、221億港元的香港股票收益、1,007億港元的其他股票收益、非港元資產的負130億港元貨幣換算影響，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益379億港元。另一方面，戰略組合記錄了2.5%的估值收益。\n\n交易所基金的總資產在年底達到4,206.7億港元。長期資產管理計劃（LTGP）下的投資總值為335.1億港元，其中私人股權為233.4億港元，不動產為101.7億港元。未償還的投資承諾達到219.3億港元。\n\n2019年，扣除戰略投資組合後，聯匯基金的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP取得9.7%的回報率，而Bp則獲得了2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP已記錄年化內部回報率為12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。在機構內，致力作出各項努力，以改善香港金融管理局的公司治理，包括支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，以及推動創新文化，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 與社區互動\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is **\"ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\"**, and the dictionary specifies that the term **\"engaging\"** must be translated as **\"聘用\"** (to employ\/hire). However, this translation is contextually inappropriate. \"Engaging\" in this context does not mean \"hiring\" but rather \"interacting with\" or \"involving\" the community. The dictionary entry appears to be either incorrect or misapplied, as \"聘用\" is not a suitable translation for \"engaging\" in this context.\nDespite this, the junior translators strictly followed the dictionary and translated \"engaging\" as \"聘用\", resulting in titles like **\"聘用社區\"** or **\"募聘社群\"**. These translations are grammatically correct in Chinese but semantically off. The phrase \"聘用社區\" literally means \"hiring the community,\" which is nonsensical in this context.\nThe most fluent and contextually appropriate translation would be **\"與社區互動\"** or **\"參與社區\"**, which better reflects the idea of engaging or involving the community. However, since the dictionary mandates the use of **\"聘用\"** for **\"engaging\"**, the best possible translation under this constraint would be **\"聘用社區\"**, even though it is not semantically accurate.\nIf the dictionary were to be corrected, \"engaging\" should be translated as **\"互動\"** or **\"參與\"** instead of **\"聘用\"**. However, given the current constraints, the most accurate translation based on the dictionary is **\"聘用社區\"**, even though it is not ideal in meaning.\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策及工作的了解。在本年度內，共舉辦了125場開放的傳媒活動，包括10場記者會、12場即場訪問及103場其他公開活動。另外安排了25場媒體訪問。共發佈了466份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局舉辦了針對本地及海外媒體以及社區內關鍵意見領袖的媒體簡報會及教育研討會，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為競爭力國際金融中心的地位。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上都較為準確地傳達了原文意思，但在語感、語法、用詞及文化適應性方面仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，符合傳統中文語法與表達習慣。唯一可微調之處為「聯繫匯率制度」中「聯繫」一詞，根據詞典應為「掛鈎」，但此處使用「聯繫」在語境中亦可接受，不影響理解。\n2. **第二譯文**：語句流暢，但「聯系」一詞與詞典中「linked」的正確譯法「掛鈎」不符，應修正。此外，「具競爭力的」雖語意正確，但略顯口語化，可考慮使用「競爭力國際金融中心」更符合正式語境。\n3. **第三譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「媒體簡報」與「教育工作坊」的搭配略顯不自然，建議使用「簡報會」與「研討會」更符合常見搭配。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，但「廣泛範圍主題」語意重複，應簡化為「廣泛主題」。此外，「HKMA」在中文中通常以「香港金融管理局」全稱出現，除非上下文已明確提及，否則建議使用全稱。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，但「地位」一詞略顯強調，與原文語氣稍有出入，建議使用「角色」或「定位」更貼切。\n6. **第六譯文**：語句通順，但「掛鈎匯率制度」與「LERS」的搭配略顯不自然，建議使用「聯繫匯率制度（LERS）」更符合常見用法。此外，「競爭力強的」語意正確，但略顯口語化，建議使用「競爭力國際金融中心」更正式。\n**改進建議：**\n- 確保所有詞典中指定的英文詞彙正確對應至指定的中文翻譯。\n- 避免語意重複或語法不自然的搭配。\n- 使用正式、流暢的語體，符合官方文件或新聞稿的語境。\n- 確保專有名詞如「LERS」與其對應中文名稱搭配自然。\n**最終翻譯：**\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局舉辦了針對本地及海外媒體以及社區內關鍵意見領袖的媒體簡報會及教育研討會，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為競爭力國際金融中心的地位。\n\n自2018年7月起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出各項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育及溝通。現時共有5個社交媒體渠道正在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年底，總共有超過45,000名用戶。在2019年下半年的社會事件之下，HKMA利用社交媒體反駁有關銀行營運及金融穩定的不實謠言，此舉證明在傳播事實及防止謠言進一步散播方面高度有效。\n\n# 公共查詢\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供了一種有效的方式，以更好地了解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的主要功能及營運情況。2019年共處理了9,742宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及規則、消費者銀行服務以及紙幣和硬幣有關。一些顯著的查詢涉及硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函、轉數快（FPS）以及貨幣和經濟統計數據。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年起接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖2則提供2019年按查詢性質分類的詳細資料。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁葉國華先生在香港銀行公會傑出演講者午宴上發言。\n\n香港金融管理局局長葉國華先生（左），以及當時的香港金融管理局局長陳德霖先生，在公布葉國華先生接任香港金融管理局局長的任命後，與媒體會面。\n\n# 研究報告\n\n除了香港金融管理局年度報告外，2019年香港金融管理局刊登了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊，以及定期更新的月度統計通訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局還刊登了19篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項主題。inSight文章為香港金融管理局提供了一個有用的渠道，用以闡述其重大新措施或政策的理據，並對公眾關注的新課題作出適時回應。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過4萬頁以英文、傳統中文及簡體中文編寫的內容，是公眾取得金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及AIs證券人員的紀錄冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施（SVF）牌照持有人的紀錄冊。金管局官方網站於9月進行重大翻新，並以全新設計佈局、內容更豐富、導覽結構加強及搜尋功能更方便的面貌重新推出。翻新後的網站讓用戶能更輕易及方便地根據個人喜好搜尋資訊。特別是，翻新後的網站新增「聰明消費者」專欄，公眾可在其中找到有關銀行及相關產品或服務的廣泛資訊及實用技巧。這與金管局一向推動「聰明及負責任」使用銀行服務的目標相符。\n\n香港金融管理局推出其改版網站。\n\n翻新的香港金融管理局網站新增了一個名為「智能消費者」的專區。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式編程介面（Open API），開放其網站上刊登的財務數據及重要資訊。至2019年，香港金融管理局已按原計劃在其網站上開放了130組開放API。香港金融管理局積極推動開放API的發展與應用。\n\n# 香港金融管理局資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社區介紹香港金融管理局工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心包括展覽區及圖書館，並於每週六天對公眾開放。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行的發展歷程，亦包含有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料與展品。\n\n香港金融管理局於本年已完成資訊中心「歷史時間軸」最後一階段的翻新工程。翻新後的「歷史時間軸」以多媒體及數碼展示板為主題，讓訪問學者能以更互動的方式檢討香港及世界各地的重大貨幣及金融事件，並於10月重新對公眾開放。\n\n歷史時間軸的首個部分由一個多媒體展示面板組成，介紹從1842年至1993年的重大事件。\n\n歷史時間軸的第二部分是一個數位顯示面板，介紹自1993年香港金融管理局設立以來至現在的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心為訪問學者提供導賞服務。在該年度期間，資訊中心接獲超過48,000名訪問學者，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過480次導賞服務（圖3）。自2003年12月開立以來，已有超過753,000名市民造訪資訊中心。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體訪問學者舉辦以導賞服務形式的導覽活動。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽區，館藏超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他研究報告，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，保持持牌機構及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及持牌機構證券人員的紀錄冊。\n\n# 公與消費者教育\n# 公眾與消費者教育\n公眾及消費者教育\n公眾與消費者教育\n公眾及消費者教育\n公共教育與消費者教育\n經過審視這些翻譯，可以看出它們都圍繞「public and consumer education」這個主題進行翻譯，但存在一些細微差異。首先，「public」這個詞在中文中可以翻譯為「公共」或「公眾」，兩者都正確，但「公眾」更常用於指代大眾或一般民眾，而「公共」則更強調公共性或公共事務。其次，「consumer education」翻譯為「消費者教育」是正確且自然的。\n在這些翻譯中，「公眾與消費者教育」和「公眾及消費者教育」都是正確且自然的翻譯，其中「與」和「及」在這裡的語境中幾乎可以互換使用，但「與」更常見於正式場合，而「及」則更偏向於書面語或較為正式的語境。\n此外，一些翻譯在開頭加入了「#」符號，這可能是為了標記標題，但在正式的中文文本中，通常不會使用「#」符號來標記標題，而是使用其他方式，如加粗或使用標題格式。\n因此，最佳的翻譯應該是「公眾與消費者教育」，這個翻譯既準確又自然，符合中文的語法和用詞習慣。\n公眾與消費者教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2019年舉辦了一場公眾教育研討會，邀請超過400名中學學生及教師參與。研討會涵蓋的主題包括香港金融管理局的工作介紹、香港紙幣、轉數快、儲值支付工具、金融科技及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃推出以來，已有超過60,000名教師及學生參與此計劃。\n\n來自不同區中學的學生和教師參加了2019年的公共教育研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度消費者教育倡議的重點，是教育公眾保護其「個人數碼鑰匙」的概念，這個概念被引入以幫助公眾視覺化保障資訊以使用其網上賬戶的重要性。核心訊息是，在數碼世界中，帳戶登錄細節及與網上銀行及其他數字金融服務相關的個人資料，與家門的鑰匙一樣重要，應予以良好保護。為此，管理局安排了廣泛的推廣活動，透過不同媒體進行，包括電視、電台、手機應用程式、社交媒體及其他數碼及戶外平台，以突出保護個人數碼鑰匙的智慧提示。\n\n旗艦個人數位金鑰推廣活動透過廣泛的跨媒體進行。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯的譯文時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性，以及是否符合中文表達習慣與文化語境。此外，必須確保字典中指定的英文詞彙被正確翻譯為對應的繁體中文詞彙。\n1. **第一譯文**：「旗艦個人數位金鑰推廣活動透過廣泛的跨媒體進行。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確，語序自然，符合中文表達習慣。  \n   - 缺點：「旗艦」作為「flagship」的翻譯，雖然在中文中可用，但語境上略顯生硬，不如「重點」或「頭號」更貼切。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n2. **第二譯文**：「個人數位密鑰的重點活動透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行。」  \n   - 優點：使用「重點活動」更符合「flagship campaign」的語意，語句流暢。  \n   - 缺點：「推廣」與「進行」的語序略顯不自然，可調整語序使語意更清晰。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n3. **第三譯文**：「個人數字密鑰旗艦活動是透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行的。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確，語序自然。  \n   - 缺點：「數字」與「數位」在中文中語意略有差異，「數位」更符合技術語境。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n4. **第四譯文**：「個人數位鑰匙的頭號活動是透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行。」  \n   - 優點：「頭號活動」語意明確，符合「flagship campaign」的語境。  \n   - 缺點：「鑰匙」與「密鑰」語意不同，「密鑰」更符合技術語境。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n5. **第五譯文**：「個人數位密鑰旗艦活動透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確，語序自然，用詞準確。  \n   - 缺點：「旗艦」語意略顯生硬，可考慮使用「重點」或「頭號」。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n6. **第六譯文**：「個人數位鑰匙旗艦活動是透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行的。」  \n   - 優點：語法正確，語序自然。  \n   - 缺點：「鑰匙」與「密鑰」語意不同，「密鑰」更符合技術語境。  \n   - 字典詞彙使用正確。\n**改進方向：**  \n- 「flagship campaign」應翻譯為「重點活動」或「頭號活動」，語意更自然。  \n- 「digital keys」應翻譯為「數位密鑰」，語意更準確。  \n- 「via」與「conducted」的語序應調整為「透過……進行」，語意更清晰。  \n- 「cross-media promotion」應翻譯為「跨媒體推廣」，語意準確。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n個人數位密鑰重點活動透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行。\n\n持續的倡議亦已展開，以教育公眾成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。例如，敦促公眾保持警覺，提防冒充銀行來電的詐騙電話，以及在社交媒體上宣傳的投資詐騙。關於處理個人信貸產品時需要注意的問題，特別是在納稅季節辦理的個人貸款，亦已廣泛宣傳。\n\n為提升中學生的財務素養，香港金融管理局連續第五年與各項持份者合辦「香港通識教育財務素養錦標賽」。今年賽事首次運用資訊圖表，幫助學生更好地理解複雜的財務概念。賽事同時進行網上測驗，吸引10,450份參與，最終進入決賽，並首次於香港金融管理局舉辦。\n為提升中學生的財務素養，香港金融管理局連續第五年與各項持份者合辦「香港通識教育財務素養錦標賽」。今年賽事首次運用資訊圖表，幫助學生更好地理解複雜的財務概念。賽事同時進行網上測驗，吸引10,450份參與，最終進入決賽，並首次於香港金融管理局舉辦。\n\n冠軍賽吸引逾10,000份網上報名，最終以在香港金融管理局舉行的現場比賽作結。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局展開了其跨世代推廣教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃與一所教育機構聯合舉辦。該計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲、家長研討會及培訓講師工作坊，針對幼稚園學生、其家長及教師，以及年青人。其他針對年青人教育的措施包括與專業團體聯合為小學學生及家長製作漫畫故事書，以及為大專學生提供研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續支持投資者及財務教育委員會，推動香港的財務素養及能力，並將探索與不同持份者進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響力。\n\n跨世代外展計畫第一階段的成就發布會，將與第二階段的推出一同舉辦。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   \"跨世代外展計畫第一階段成就發布會一同舉辦，並推出第二階段。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms \"舉辦\" for \"held\" and \"推出\" for \"launch.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is awkward. \"一同舉辦\" should be paired with the event, not placed at the end. Also, the phrase \"並推出第二階段\" is unclear—does it mean the ceremony is also launching the second phase, or is the second phase being launched separately?\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   \"第一階段跨世代社區參與計劃的成就發布會將於第二階段的推出活動中一同舉行。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"舉辦\" and \"推出\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"社區參與計劃\" is not in the dictionary and adds unnecessary information. Also, the phrase \"推出活動中一同舉行\" is awkward and unclear.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   \"跨世代拓展計劃首個階段的成就發布會，與第二階段一同推出。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"首個\" for \"first\" and \"推出\" for \"launch.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"拓展計劃\" is not in the dictionary and may mislead the reader. Also, the structure \"與第二階段一同推出\" implies the ceremony is being launched, which is not accurate.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"跨世代外展計劃第一階段的成就發布會，將與第二階段的推出一同舉辦。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and has a clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy, but overall fluent and accurate.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"跨世代接觸計劃首個階段的成就發布會將與第二階段的推出一同舉辦。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"首個\" and \"推出\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"接觸計劃\" is not in the dictionary and may not be the best term for \"Outreach Programme.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"跨世代接觸計劃首個階段的成就發布會，將一同推出第二階段。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"首個\" and \"推出\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is confusing. It implies the ceremony is launching the second phase, which is not the intended meaning.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms: \"舉辦\" for \"held,\" \"推出\" for \"launch,\" \"一同\" for \"alongside,\" \"第二\" for \"second,\" \"成就\" for \"achievement,\" \"發布會\" for \"Ceremony,\" and \"首個\" for \"first.\"\n- Maintain a clear and natural sentence structure in Traditional Chinese.\n- Avoid adding or changing terms not in the dictionary.\n- Ensure the meaning is clear: the ceremony is held alongside the launch of the second phase.\nBased on these criteria, the fourth junior translator's version is the closest, but it can be slightly refined for clarity and fluency. The final translation provided above improves upon it by ensuring the structure is natural and the meaning is clear.\n\n幼稚園學生參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書是與專業團體聯合製作，用以向小學生及其家長傳授有關利用銀行及金融服務的實用技巧。\n\n# 我們的市民\n# 我們的市民\n\n雖然香港金融管理局是政府不可分割的**部分**，但它**聘請**員工的**條款**與公務員制度**不同**，以吸引具有合適**經驗**和專業知識的**市民**。香港金融管理局招聘、發展和**保持**一支**高度**專業的**工作**隊伍，以**支持**其政策目標，並**靈活**地**回應**變化的**工作**優先事項。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses all dictionary terms, and the sentence structure is clear and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses**: The term \"工作\" (work) is used twice in the last sentence, which is awkward and redundant. \"工作優先事項\" is not idiomatic in Chinese; \"工作重點\" or \"工作優先事項\" would be better.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**:\n   - **Strengths**: Natural flow and accurate use of dictionary terms.\n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"workforce\" directly as \"workforce\" instead of translating it to \"工作隊伍\" or \"工作人員隊伍\", which is not in the dictionary.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to socialise.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

企業社會責任\n\n香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，並力求成為負責任且可持續發展的組織。此承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動可持續及環保的市場、支持更廣的社區、保護環境及培育友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續銀行業\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉和全球經濟可持續發展的重大風險之一。銀行所處的金融部門作為社會的重要組成部分，亦將受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。香港金融管理局致力於探討應對此挑戰的方法。在此背景下，香港金融管理局於5月公布了一系列措施，以推動香港綠色金融的發展，包括採用三個階段的方法來推動綠色及可持續銀行業務。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n作為外匯基金的投資經理，香港金融管理局認為責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於香港金融管理局是全球最大資產擁有者之一，它將對基金經理如何選擇資產產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金融管理局視RI為一種投資方法，該方法考慮各項環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素對長線投資回報及其可持續性的影響。香港金融管理局認為，透過適當強調RI及可持續長線經濟表現，可更好地取得儲備基金的投資目標，並減少與其基礎投資相關的ESG因素所帶來的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n香港金融管理局的指導原則是，若長線風險調整後的回報與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮環境、社會及管治（ESG）投資。在適當的情況下，香港金融管理局在其投資過程中採用以下責任投資（RI）原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任的長線投資者的理念。\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金融管理局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析流程中，以識別風險和機遇，因其認為這些因素會對其投資的長線價值產生重大影響。具體而言，香港金融管理局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入其公眾市場及私人市場投資的投資流程中。針對公眾市場投資，香港金融管理局在其債券投資的信貸風險分析中納入環境、社會及管治因素。與香港金融管理局共享其RI理念的外部管理人會被物色並委任。香港金融管理局會向所有外部管理人傳達其RI理念，並預期他們能配合，以達致整體可持續的長線經濟表現目標。針對私人市場投資，香港金融管理局會在其盡職調查流程中檢視其一般合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實踐。\n\n# 積極所有權  \n積極股權  \n主動擁有  \n主動所有權  \n# 积極股東權  \n# 活躍股權  \n上述翻譯各有其優缺點。首先，「積極所有權」與「主動所有權」在語意上較接近「Active ownership」的字面意義，但可能缺乏商業語境中的精準性。其次，「積極股權」與「活躍股權」雖然在語感上較符合金融或企業治理的語境，但「股權」一詞更偏向「shareholding」，而「ownership」則涵蓋更廣的擁有權概念。再者，「主動擁有」雖然語意通順，但略顯口語化，不夠正式。最後，「# 积極股東權」與「# 活躍股權」使用了標籤符號「#」，與原文格式不符，且「股東權」一詞偏向「shareholder rights」，與「ownership」語意不完全一致。\n考慮到「Active ownership」在企業治理與投資領域中常指「積極的股東行為」或「主動參與公司治理」，因此「積極所有權」或「主動所有權」較為貼切。然而，若需更符合商業語境，「積極股權」或「活躍股權」亦可接受。綜合考量語意準確性與語境適切性，「積極所有權」為最佳選擇。\n積極所有權\n\n香港金融管理局以有助保障其投資長期價值的方式，行使在公眾股權持有中的股東權利。香港金融管理局相信，以環境、社會及管治因素為指引的負責任企業行為，將有助於在長遠創造股東價值。香港金融管理局的資產管理人預期會透過行使投票權及與有關企業接觸，採納積極的股東行為，協助香港金融管理局履行其在基礎投資中的股東責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金融管理局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手，推動長線投資管理的良好實踐。它參與並在公開活動上發言，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用RI。\n\n請參閱「儲備管理」一章，以了解更多有關香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度就RI進行工作的細則。\n以下是對各個翻譯版本的評審與分析：\n1. **第一個翻譯**：整體語意正確，但「就利率影響的相關工作細則」語氣較為生硬，且「利率影響」並非原文中「RI」的明確對應，可能造成理解偏差。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：使用「看到」作為「see」的翻譯，不符合正式語境，且「RI」未明確翻譯，語意不完整。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：使用「HKMA’」保留英文符號，不符合中文語法習慣，且「RI」未明確翻譯，語意不清。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：將「Reserves Management」翻譯為「儲備資產管理」，與原文「Reserves Management」不完全一致，且「風險投資」與「RI」無關，明顯誤譯。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：語意清晰，使用「RI」保留英文縮寫，符合原文語境，但未明確標示「HKMA」的中文全稱，略顯不完整。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：語意完整，使用「RI」保留英文縮寫，並正確標示「HKMA」的中文全稱，語法自然，符合正式文件的語境。\n**改進建議**：在保留「RI」英文縮寫的同時，應明確標示「HKMA」的中文全稱，並使用正式語氣，如「請參閱」、「以了解更多有關」等，使語句更符合正式文件的語境與語法。\n**最佳翻譯**：請參閱「儲備管理」一章，以了解更多有關香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度就RI進行工作的細則。\n\n# 推動金融包容性\n推動金融包容性為最佳翻譯，因其準確反映「financial inclusion」的含義，即確保所有人都能公平地獲得金融服務。其他翻譯如「金融普惠」或「金融普及」雖接近，但未能完全傳達「包容性」的深層意義。此外，「推動金融包容」雖正確，但缺少「性」字，使語意稍顯不完整。因此，選擇「推動金融包容性」作為最精準且符合語境的翻譯。\n\n香港金融管理局重視金融包容，一直致力推動不同社會群體接觸基本銀行服務，以滿足公眾日常基本需要及合法企業的營運需要。特別是，香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，重點推動以下優先範疇：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多實體銀行設施，並制定數碼及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務一般公眾，特別是偏遠地區居民、公共房屋居民及長者；\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，發現幾個關鍵問題：\n1. **「physical banking facilities」的翻譯：**  \n   全部翻譯均使用「體格銀行設施」，但「體格」在中文中意指「身體狀況」，與「physical」在此處的語境（實體、物理的）不符。正確的翻譯應為「實體銀行設施」，而非「體格銀行設施」。第五位翻譯正確使用了「實體」，其他皆有誤。\n2. **「develop」的翻譯：**  \n   字典中「develop」的翻譯選項為「制定」，但根據語境，「develop」在此處應為「開發」或「建立」之意，「制定」更偏向於「制定政策」或「制定計劃」，與「digital and innovative channels」的語境不完全契合。然而，所有翻譯均使用「制定」，因此需在語境中調整語意，使其更自然。\n3. **語句流暢度與語法：**  \n   多數翻譯語句結構正確，但部分用詞略顯生硬，如「服務一般公眾」、「服務大眾」等重複使用「服務」一詞，使句子顯得累贅。可考慮調整語序或用詞，使語句更自然。\n4. **文化與語境適應性：**  \n   「public housing estates」翻譯為「公共房屋」或「公共屋邨」皆可接受，但「公共屋邨」更符合香港語境，而「公共房屋」則較為中性。根據語境，若無特定地區限制，兩者皆可接受。\n**改進建議：**  \n- 使用「實體銀行設施」取代「體格銀行設施」，以符合語境。\n- 使用「開發」或「建立」取代「制定」，使語意更貼切。\n- 調整語序，避免重複使用「服務」一詞，使語句更流暢自然。\n- 確保用詞符合語境與文化背景，如「公共屋邨」更符合香港語境。\n**最終翻譯：**  \n鼓勵銀行推出更多實體銀行設施，並開發數碼及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務一般公眾，特別是偏遠地區居民、公共屋邨居民及長者；\n\n促進及監察銀行帳戶對個人及中小企的可及性；\n促進及監測銀行賬戶對個人和中小企的可及性；\n- 促進並監督個人及中小企對銀行帳戶的可及性；\n促進及監察個人及中小企開立銀行帳戶的可及性；\n促進個人和中小企（中小企）接近銀行賬戶的可達性，並進行監控；\n促進及監察個人和中小企銀行帳戶的可存取性；\n以上六個翻譯各有優缺點。第一個翻譯用詞準確，語法正確，符合中文表達習慣，是較佳的選擇。第二個翻譯中「監測」與原文「monitoring」不完全對應，且「賬戶」應為「帳戶」。第三個翻譯語序與原文略有出入，且使用「開立」一詞略顯冗餘。第四個翻譯語序與原文不一致，且「開立」一詞不必要。第五個翻譯中「可達性」與「可及性」語意相近，但「可達性」較少用於此類語境，且括號使用不當。第六個翻譯中「可存取性」雖正確，但與「可及性」語意略有差異。\n綜合考量，第一個翻譯最為準確，語法正確，符合中文表達習慣，且用詞準確。因此，最佳翻譯應為：促進及監察銀行帳戶對個人及中小企的可及性；\n\n提升銀行服務對特定客戶群體的可及性，例如殘障人士及少數民族客戶；\n\n促進及監察銀行信貸對中小企的可及性；以及\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，首先需確認字詞是否符合詞典要求。詞典中「facilitating」對應「促進」，而「SMEs」對應「中小企」。所有翻譯均正確使用了這些詞彙，因此在這方面無需修正。\n接下來分析語句的流暢度與語法正確性。第一份翻譯「促進及監察中小企獲得銀行信貸的可得性；及」語法正確，但「可得性」較少見於正式文本，「可及性」更常見於政策或金融領域。第二份翻譯使用「可及性」，語感更自然，但使用「和」結尾與原文「and」不完全對應。第三至第六份翻譯在語法上均正確，但第三與第四份使用「並」與「監督\/監控」，語氣較強調行動，與原文「facilitating and monitoring」的語氣相符。第五與第六份翻譯將「中小企」置於「銀行信貸」後，語序與原文略有出入，可能影響理解。\n此外，原文為「Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and」，語氣較正式，屬於政策或報告類文本。因此，翻譯應保持正式語氣，並確保語序與原文一致。\n綜合考量語法、語感、語序與正式程度，最佳翻譯應使用「促進及監察銀行信貸對中小企的可及性；以及」，語序與原文一致，用詞自然，符合政策文本的語氣。\n\n授予八間虛擬銀行授權，這些銀行在提供銀行服務時將積極推動金融包容性。\n\n# 社區\n\n# 推動財務素養\n\n香港金融管理局透過各項渠道推動財務素養。除了運作教育計劃，以推動公眾聰明及負責任地運用銀行及金融服務外，香港金融管理局在其重新設計的官方網站上設有專門的「聰明消費者」新專區，讓公眾可找到涵蓋廣泛銀行及相關產品和服務的有用資訊及聰明提示。此外，香港金融管理局亦運用Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等社交媒體平台，以及其官方網站和研究報告，提供最新的銀行及金融事務資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心自2003年起作為香港金融管理局的主要公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。資訊中心每日為來自學校及非牟利機構的團體訪問學者提供導賞服務。此外，亦舉辦公眾教育講座及其他活動，以提升學生的財務知識及素養。香港金融管理局亦與投資者及財務教育委員會緊密合作，透過其財務教育平台「The Chin Family」在香港推動財務素養。\n\n請參閱「企業職能」一章，以了解更多關於香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度推動財務素養的細則。請參閱「銀行穩定」一章，以了解更多關於香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度推動財務包容的細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體的需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可及性\n\n2018年紙幣系列保留了上一系列紙幣中運用的輔助特點，以幫助視障人士區分不同面額。這些輔助特點包括點字、觸覺線條及高觸感數字。\n\n為幫助視障人士分辨紙幣的面額，一款由香港金融管理局贊助、香港盲人社會開發的移動應用程式，會使用手機相機掃描紙幣圖案以辨識面額。此應用程式可於 Apple App Store 及 Google Play Store 免費下載。香港金融管理局與三間發行紙幣的銀行亦引入了一款測量紙幣長度的模板，用以測量 2018 系列紙幣及現時流通的紙幣。該模板一邊壓印有點字，另一邊則有符號。此模板會免費分發予服務視障人士的志願機構。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計畫\n\n在「硬幣收集」計劃下，香港金融管理局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取硬幣推車於旗日為非政府組織收集硬幣。  \n此翻譯在語法、用詞與語意上皆較為準確自然。首先，「香港金融管理局」為正確機構名稱，符合官方譯名；其次，「採取硬幣推車」正確使用了「deploy」的對應詞「採取」，並搭配「硬幣推車」一詞，語意清晰。再者，「於旗日」準確翻譯了「on flag days」，語氣自然。最後，「為非政府組織收集硬幣」語序正確，語意完整，符合中文表達習慣。  \n其他翻譯版本存在以下問題：  \n- 第一版翻譯中「將硬幣收集車部署於非政府組織的旗日」語序不自然，且「部署」一詞與「採取」相比，語意較為強硬，與原文語境不完全契合。  \n- 第二版翻譯中「採取硬幣推車收集硬幣於旗日為非政府機構」語序混亂，導致語意不清。  \n- 第三版翻譯中「採取『硬幣車』來收集各非政府組織在籌款日所用的硬幣」將「旗日」誤譯為「籌款日」，與原文不符。  \n- 第四版翻譯中「在節日當天」與「旗日」語意不完全一致，且「節日當天」語意較為籠統。  \n- 第五版翻譯中「志願日」與「旗日」語意不符，誤譯原文。  \n- 第六版翻譯中「升旗日」雖與「旗日」語意相近，但語氣較為強調「升旗」行為，與原文語境不完全一致。  \n因此，最佳翻譯應為：  \n在「硬幣收集」計劃下，香港金融管理局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取硬幣推車於旗日為非政府組織收集硬幣。\n\n# 公共資訊的可及性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的改版官方網站於9月推出。改版後的網站加強了導覽結構，以根據用戶的個人偏好促進更輕鬆便捷的搜索。特別是，網站在「智慧消費者」專欄下設有專用專頁「其他語言資訊」，提供有用資訊，介紹少數族裔常用的七種語言的銀行服務，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、他加祿語、泰語和烏爾都語。\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的改版官方網站於9月推出。改版後的網站加強了導覽結構，以根據用戶的個人偏好促進更輕鬆便捷的搜索。特別是，網站在「智慧消費者」專欄下設有專用專頁「其他語言資訊」，提供有用資訊，介紹少數族裔常用的七種語言的銀行服務，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、他加祿語、泰語和烏爾都語。\n\n香港金融管理局致力確保其網站盡最大可能符合萬維網聯盟（W3C）網頁內容可存取性指南（WCAG）2.0 AA級標準，以促進有特殊需要的市民無障礙地接觸其網上資訊。\n\n# 志願服務及慈善活動\n所有翻譯版本都正確地將 \"volunteer\" 翻譯為「志願服務」或「志願」，並將 \"charitable activities\" 翻譯為「慈善活動」。這些翻譯在語法和用詞上都正確，符合繁體中文的表達習慣。其中，第一、第二、第四和第六個翻譯版本使用了「及」字，而第三和第五個版本則分別使用了「及」和「與」字。在中文中，「及」和「與」都可以用來連接兩個並列的成分，但「及」更常用於正式或書面語境中，而「與」則較為中性。因此，使用「及」字的版本在語氣上更正式，更適合用於標題或正式文件中。此外，第四和第六個版本在翻譯前加上了「#」符號，這可能是為了與原文中的標題格式保持一致，但在中文中，這種格式並非標準做法，因此可以考慮省略。綜合考慮語氣、語法和格式，「志願服務及慈善活動」是最為恰當的翻譯。\n\n香港金融管理局透過參與志願及慈善活動支持社區服務。長者家居安全協會頒發社區參與水晶獎予香港金融管理局，以表彰其參與2018年「愛與安心」企業參與計劃。\n\n香港金管局志願者團隊於2019年參與的慈善活動。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms \"團隊\" for \"team\" and \"參與\" for \"participated.\" The structure is natural and adheres to Traditional Chinese grammar and style.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is also correct and fluent. It uses the same dictionary terms and omits the word \"the\" before \"HKMA Volunteer Team,\" which is acceptable in Chinese. The only minor difference is the use of \"志願團隊\" instead of \"志願者團隊,\" but both are acceptable.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is problematic. It incorrectly translates \"HKMA\" as \"香港醫療輔助隊\" (Hong Kong Auxiliary Medical Service), which is a different organization. This is a clear error and should be corrected.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is accurate and concise. It uses the correct dictionary terms and omits the word \"the\" before \"HKMA Volunteer Team,\" which is acceptable in Chinese. The structure is natural and fluent.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is incorrect. It translates \"HKMA\" as \"香港按揭證券有限公司\" (Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited), which is not the correct name for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This is a significant error and should be corrected.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is also incorrect for the same reason as the fifth. It uses the wrong name for HKMA and should be corrected.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the correct name for HKMA, which is \"香港金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), and should use the correct dictionary terms \"團隊\" and \"參與.\" The first junior translator's translation meets all these criteria and is the most accurate and fluent. It also uses the correct structure and adheres to Traditional Chinese grammar and style. Therefore, it is the best translation among the provided options.\n\n「Yo! Let’s Walk the Road」由青年外展主辦。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   「喂！與年青人同行」由青年外展部主辦。  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the term “年青人” for “youth” and “青年外展部” for “Youth Outreach.” The structure is fluent and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “與年青人同行” slightly changes the original meaning of “Walk the Road” to “Walk with the Youth,” which may not fully capture the original intent.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   「Yo！一起走這條路」由年青人外展部製作。  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “年青人” and “道路” correctly. The phrase “一起走這條路” is natural and conveys the idea of walking a path together.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “製作” (produced) is not the best fit for “by the Youth Outreach.” “主辦” (organized) or “發起” (initiated) would be more appropriate.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   喂！讓我們走在道路上，由年青人外展團隊發起。  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “年青人” and “道路” correctly. The phrase “讓我們走在道路上” is natural and conveys the original meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure is slightly awkward, and the use of “團隊” (team) may not be the best fit for “Outreach.”  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   “喂！讓我們走這條道路” by 年青人外展  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “年青人” and “道路” correctly. The phrase “讓我們走這條道路” is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of “by” as “by” is not natural in Chinese. “主辦” or “發起” would be better.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   “喂！讓我們走道路” by the 年青人外展  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “走道路” is awkward and lacks the nuance of “Walk the Road.” The use of “by the” is not natural in Chinese.  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   「Yo！讓我們走這條道路」由年青人外展隊創作。  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “年青人” and “道路” correctly. The phrase “讓我們走這條道路” is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “創作” (created) is not the best fit for “by the Youth Outreach.” “主辦” or “發起” would be more appropriate.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should use the correct terms from the dictionary, maintain the original meaning, and be fluent and natural in Traditional Chinese. The phrase “Walk the Road” should be translated as “走這條道路” or “走這條路” to capture the nuance of the original. The term “Youth Outreach” should be translated as “青年外展” or “年青人外展,” with “青年” being more commonly used in formal contexts. The phrase “by the Youth Outreach” should be translated as “由青年外展主辦” to convey the idea of being organized or initiated by the group.  \n**Final Translation:**  \n「Yo！讓我們走這條道路」由青年外展主辦。\n\n藝術家及來自社會企業「香港殘疾人士藝術協會」的代表參觀香港按揭證券有限公司辦公室，該處展示其藝術作品。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司的員工積極參與獻血日、全港升旗日、社區 Chest 的綠色日、愛牙日、跳過午飯日、休閒服裝日以及定期為慈善團體收集衣物、玩具及其他可重用物品的宣傳活動。\n\n金管局員工積極參與由香港紅十字會舉辦的獻血日活動。\n\n# 慈善機構\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Caring organisation\", with the dictionary specifying that \"caring\" must be translated as \"友善\". The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\n1. **#友善組織** – This translation is concise and uses the correct term \"友善\" from the dictionary. However, the use of the hashtag symbol \"#\" is retained, which may not be culturally appropriate in all contexts. It is acceptable if the text is intended for social media or similar platforms.\n2. **# 友善組織** – This version includes a space between the hashtag and the term, which is not standard in English but may be acceptable in some contexts. The term \"友善組織\" is correct.\n3. **友善機構** – This translation replaces \"organisation\" with \"機構\", which is a valid synonym in Chinese. However, it changes the original term without justification, which may not be appropriate if the original term is to be preserved as closely as possible.\n4. **# 友善機構** – Similar to the third translation, this version uses \"機構\" instead of \"組織\" and includes a space after the hashtag. It is slightly less accurate than the original term \"organisation\".\n5. **友善的組織** – This version adds the particle \"的\" after \"友善\", which is not necessary in this context and makes the phrase slightly more verbose than needed.\n6. **友善組織** – This is the most concise and accurate translation, using the correct term \"友善\" and preserving \"組織\" as the translation for \"organisation\". It lacks the hashtag, which may be intentional or not, depending on the context.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact term \"友善\" for \"caring\" and preserve \"organisation\" as \"組織\". The hashtag \"#\" is retained in some translations, but it is not clear whether it is necessary in this context. If the text is intended to be a title or heading, it may be better to omit the hashtag for a more natural appearance in Traditional Chinese. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is **# 慈善機構** if the hashtag is to be retained, or **慈善機構** if it is not. Given the context, **# 慈善機構** is the most balanced and natural choice.\n\n為表彰其對社區的關懷承諾，香港金融管理局已連續第13年獲得香港社會服務聯會頒發「10年Plus友善機構標誌」。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses the term “友善” for “caring” and correctly translates “years” as “年.” The sentence structure is fluent and natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” is translated as “10年Plus友善機構標誌,” which is slightly awkward due to the use of “Plus” in English. It would be better to use the Chinese equivalent or omit it if it’s not standard in Chinese usage.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “友善” correctly and translates “10 Years Plus” as “10年加,” which is more natural in Chinese. The sentence is grammatically sound and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “認證” (certification) is not in the original text and adds an unnecessary nuance. The original says “was accredited with,” which is more accurately translated as “頒發” (awarded) rather than “認證.”  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses “友善” and includes the full name of HKMA. The structure is clear and accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “10年Plus” is used as is, which is not standard in Chinese. Also, the phrase “予HKMA” is redundant since the subject is already HKMA.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “友善” correctly and omits “Plus,” which is more natural in Chinese. The sentence is concise and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “10年” is used instead of “10 Years Plus,” which slightly alters the original meaning. The original emphasizes the “Plus” as an extension beyond 10 years, which is lost here.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “友善” correctly and translates “10 Years Plus” as “十年優良企業標誌,” which is a creative but inaccurate interpretation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The term “優良企業標誌” (excellent enterprise logo) is not equivalent to “Caring Organisation Logo.” This changes the meaning of the award.  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses “友善” correctly and translates “10 Years Plus” as “十年+,” which is more natural in Chinese.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates “HKMA” as “香港醫療協會” (Hong Kong Medical Association), which is not the correct name of the organization. Also, the term “關愛社區” (caring for the community) is slightly different from the original “care for the community.”  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should:  \n- Use the exact term “友善” for “caring.”  \n- Accurately reflect the term “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” without adding or omitting key elements.  \n- Use the correct name for HKMA (香港金融管理局).  \n- Maintain the original meaning and nuance while ensuring fluency and naturalness in Traditional Chinese.  \nBased on these considerations, the improved translation is:  \n**為表彰其對社區的關懷承諾，香港金融管理局已連續第13年獲得香港社會服務聯會頒發「10年Plus友善機構標誌」。**  \nThis version uses the correct term “友善,” retains the original phrase “10年Plus,” and accurately reflects the meaning and structure of the original English text.\n\n# 環境\n\n# 綠色辦公措施\n\n香港金融管理局已設立環境政策，以保護及保本環境。該政策及落實措施會定期向其員工公布。綠色辦公措施包括：\n\n# 紙張\/影印\/印刷\n\n- 鼓勵使用再生紙張及信封；\n- 以電子副本取代文件的實體副本；\n- 在紙張兩面印製；\n- 僅在必要時使用彩色印製及複印；\n- 避免使用紙杯；以及\n- 以環保紙張及油墨印製香港金融管理局年報。\n\n# 耗電量\n\n關掉電腦、印表機、燈光、音響視訊系統及其他電動設備，當這些設備未使用時。在預設運作時間之外使用完畢後，重新啟動大多數設備中預設安裝的省電模式，例如飲水機、電動衝擊機及碎紙機；並定期審視在正常辦公時間之外是否需要額外的空調。\n\n# 回收\n\n妥善利用回收箱來收集不同類別的廢物，包括紙張、罐頭、瓶子、電池、CD與墨盒。\n\n# 工作環境\n\n# 多元與包容性\n\n# 平等機會政策\n\n香港金融管理局是平等機會僱主。它相信每個人應能在沒有歧視、騷擾、誹謗和受害的環境中工作。平等機會政策適用於招聘廣告、招聘程序、僱傭條款及條件、工作表現評估、晉升、調職、培訓、解僱、投訴程序及一般行為。\n\n# 關於多樣性的關鍵統計數據\n\n市民是香港金融管理局工作的核心。我們重視員工隊伍的多樣性，擁有均衡的性別比例，並涵蓋不同年齡層的員工。\n\n高級管理層中，即執行董事及以上職級，女性佔比為31%，截至2020年2月。\n\n# 人力資本關鍵統計數據，截至2020年1月1日。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有翻譯都正確使用了「人力」來翻譯「human」，符合詞典要求。各版本在語法和用詞上基本正確，但存在一些細節差異。\n1. **第一版**：「人力資本關鍵統計數據，截至2020年1月1日。」語序自然，符合中文表達習慣，使用「截至」準確表達「on」的時間點，語氣正式，適合統計報告的標題。\n2. **第二版**：「# 2020年1月1日人力資本關鍵統計數據」使用了標籤符號「#」，與原文的「#」標題格式一致，但中文標題通常不使用「#」，除非是特定平台或格式要求。\n3. **第三版**：「# 人力資本於2020年1月1日的關鍵統計數據」語序稍顯生硬，「於」字使用較為正式，但與「截至」相比，語氣略顯口語化。\n4. **第四版**：與第二版相同，僅格式略有差異。\n5. **第五版**：「# 人力資本主要統計數據於2020年1月1日」將「key」翻譯為「主要」，雖然語義相近，但「關鍵」更貼近「key」在統計數據中的語境，語義更準確。\n6. **第六版**：與第二版相同。\n**改進建議：**  \n第一版在語序、語氣和語法上最為自然，符合中文標題的常見格式，且準確傳達了原文的時間與主題。若需保留「#」符號，可考慮在標題前加入，但中文標題中通常不使用此符號，除非有特殊格式要求。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n人力資本關鍵統計數據，截至2020年1月1日。\n\n# 品質工作環境  \n優質的工作環境  \n# 優質工作環境\n\n為應付預計的運作需要，香港金融管理局在本年度對辦公室進行了翻新，以創造開放式布局，增加容量，並讓空間使用更高效。休息區和符合人體工學的家具是新辦公室設計的一部分。為提升員工的體格健康，管理局向員工提供可調節高度的書桌，讓他們在一天當中可以輕易地在坐姿和站姿之間切換姿勢。\n為應付預計的運作需要，香港金融管理局在本年度對辦公室進行了翻新，以創造開放式布局，增加容量，並讓空間使用更高效。休息區和符合人體工學的家具是新辦公室設計的一部分。為提升員工的體格健康，管理局向員工提供可調節高度的書桌，讓他們在一天當中可以輕易地在坐姿和站姿之間切換姿勢。\n\n可調節高度的桌子能改善辦公室人體工學。\n\n# 員工福祉\n\n香港金融管理局推動工作與生活平衡，並關心員工的健康及工作安全。定期舉辦有關健康生活方式、壓力管理及工作環境安全的研討會，並監察室內空氣質素。每年安排現場醫療檢查及流感疫苗接種。香港金融管理局亦贊助由經驗豐富的心理學家及社會工作者組成的專業輔導服務。\n\n全年舉辦不同活動，以提升員工的體格健康，推動他們的歸屬感，並促進合作與團隊精神。為員工及其家屬舉辦興趣班。跨機構及跨部門活動，如與同業監管機構進行的籃球及足球比賽，亦提供社交機遇。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，首先需注意原文為「Report of the Director of Audit」與「Exchange Fund Financial Statements」，兩者皆為正式文件名稱，需在翻譯中保持嚴謹與準確。\n1. **第一份翻譯**（審計署署長報告 \/ 外匯基金財務報表）：  \n   - **優點**：用詞正式、語法正確，符合官方文件的語境。\n   - **缺點**：無明顯錯誤，但「審計署署長」為常見翻譯，語意明確。\n2. **第二份翻譯**（審計署署長報告 \/ 匯風金融報表）：  \n   - **問題**：「匯風金融」並非「Exchange Fund」的標準翻譯，易引起誤解，且「匯風」一詞在財務語境中不常見，缺乏專業性。\n3. **第三份翻譯**（審計總監報告 \/ 貨幣發行局財務報表）：  \n   - **問題**：「審計總監」與「審計署署長」語意不同，「總監」通常指某機構內的職位，而非「Director of Audit」的對應職稱；「貨幣發行局」與「Exchange Fund」無關，誤譯。\n4. **第四份翻譯**（審計主任報告 \/ Exchange Fund 財務報表）：  \n   - **問題**：「審計主任」與「Director of Audit」語意不完全對應，且「Exchange Fund」未翻譯，不符合正式文件的翻譯規範。\n5. **第五份翻譯**（審計長報告 \/ 兌換基金財務報表）：  \n   - **優點**：「審計長」為「Director of Audit」的合理翻譯，語意明確；「兌換基金」雖接近「Exchange Fund」，但略顯直譯，不如「外匯基金」自然。\n6. **第六份翻譯**（稽核長報告－交換基金財務報表）：  \n   - **問題**：「稽核長」與「審計長」語意相近，但「稽核」一詞在財務語境中較少使用；「交換基金」與「Exchange Fund」語意接近，但不如「外匯基金」自然。\n**總結與改進方向：**  \n- 「Director of Audit」最合適的翻譯為「審計署署長」或「審計長」，兩者皆可接受，但「審計署署長」更符合官方文件的語境。\n- 「Exchange Fund」應翻譯為「外匯基金」，語意明確且符合財務語境。\n- 避免使用「匯風」、「貨幣發行局」、「稽核長」等不準確或不常見的詞語。\n因此，最佳翻譯為：  \n**審計署署長報告**  \n**外匯基金財務報表**\n\n# 審計長報告書\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 評論\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）載於第187至293頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及集團截至2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收入支出賬目、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映了截至2019年12月31日基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所作出的指示妥善編製。\n各譯文在整體語意傳達上大致正確，但存在一些翻譯品質、語法、用詞及文化適應性上的問題。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：「根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）作出」語意不清，「作出」與「根據」搭配不當，且「香港會計準則」未在原文中出現，屬誤譯。\n2. **第二譯文**：「真實和公正的期望」中「期望」一詞與原文「view」語意不符，「view」在此處應為「view of the financial position」，即「財務狀況」，而非「期望」。\n3. **第三譯文**：「《發行基金條例》」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不符，應為「外匯基金條例」；「總督」一詞在現今香港語境中不適用，應為「行政長官」。\n4. **第四譯文**：「香港特許會計師公會」與「HKICPA」不符，正確譯名為「香港會計師公會」；「發鈔基金條例」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不符，應為「外匯基金條例」。\n5. **第五譯文**：「《儲備基金條例》」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不符，應為「外匯基金條例」；「第7條所頒佈的行政長官指令」語意不清，應為「第7條所作出的行政長官指示」。\n6. **第六譯文**：「《交易基金條例》」與原文「Exchange Fund Ordinance」不符，應為「外匯基金條例」；「第7日」與原文「section 7」不符，應為「第7條」；「行政長的指示」語意不清，應為「行政長官的指示」。\n總體而言，各譯文在語意傳達上存在一定程度的偏差，特別是在專有名詞與語法結構上。最佳的翻譯應當準確使用字典中指定的詞彙，並確保語句通順、符合中文語法與文化習慣。因此，最終的翻譯應當在語意準確、語法正確、用詞合適、文化適應性良好的基礎上，進行整合與優化。\n\n# 意見根據\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English phrase \"Basis for opinion\" is a concise and formal expression, typically used in legal, academic, or professional contexts to denote the foundation or rationale behind a stated opinion.\nThe junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, all of which are grammatically correct and semantically close to the original. However, there are subtle differences in tone and formality that should be considered:\n1. **# 意見的根據** – This is a direct and accurate translation. The use of “的” is appropriate, and the phrase is clear and formal.\n2. **意見的依據** – This is also correct, but “依據” is slightly more formal and often used in legal or official contexts, which may be more appropriate depending on the intended use.\n3. **意見的根據** – This is identical to the first translation and is equally valid.\n4. **# 意見基礎** – This is more concise but slightly less formal. It omits the possessive particle “的,” which may make it feel less precise in a formal context.\n5. **# 意見基礎** – Same as above.\n6. **意見基礎** – Again, this is concise but lacks the possessive particle, which may make it feel less precise in a formal context.\n**Improvement Considerations:**\n- **Formality and Precision:** In formal or professional contexts, the use of “的” is preferred to indicate possession or relation, making the phrase more precise.\n- **Consistency:** The phrase “意見的根據” appears twice and is the most consistent with the original structure.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** In Traditional Chinese, the phrase “意見的根據” is commonly used in legal and academic writing to denote the foundation of an opinion, making it the most culturally appropriate choice.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best translation is **# 意見的根據**, as it is both accurate and appropriate for formal contexts, maintaining the clarity and formality of the original English phrase.\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條作出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了我的審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步說明於我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已根據這些標準履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指依我專業判斷，在截至2019年12月31日止年度財務報表審計中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係於審計財務報表整體之背景中加以處理，並作為我形成意見之基礎，我並未就這些事項提供單獨意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債以公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n審查與分析：\n所有翻譯都大致正確，但存在一些細節差異。首先，「附註」前是否加「的」或「中」，在語法上都是可以接受的，但「附註2.5、2.6及38.1」這樣的表達更為簡潔自然。其次，「2.5」在字典中對應的是「2.5%」，但原文中並未出現百分比符號，因此直接使用「2.5」更符合原文語境。然而，第一和第四位翻譯者錯誤地將「2.5」翻譯為「2.5%」，這與原文不符，應予以修正。此外，「及」字的使用在所有翻譯中都正確，語氣自然。\n改進後的翻譯應正確使用「2.5」而非「2.5%」，並採用簡潔自然的語法結構，如「請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1」。此版本語法正確、語氣自然，且符合原文語境與字典要求。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港幣3,874,223百萬，金融負債總額為港幣1,158,686百萬，按公允價值計量。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入），或利用估值技術，並以可觀察市場數據為基礎進行估算（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n其餘9%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是利用估值技術估算，而這些技術所使用的輸入數據並非基於可觀察的市場數據（第三層輸入數據）。此類金融資產總計為338,758百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於原文中「Given」與「involved」兩詞有明確的對應譯法，需確保其正確使用。各譯文在語法與用詞上大致正確，但存在一些細節差異，影響整體流暢度與專業性。\n第一譯文使用「大量且涉及估計的數量」，語序略顯生硬，且「評價」一詞在財務語境中不如「計量」或「評估」準確。第二譯文用詞較為精準，「估算」與「計量」符合財務專業語境，但「衡量」一詞略顯口語。第三譯文雖語氣較正式，但「估算繁複」與原文「estimations involved」語意不完全對應，且「審核」與「審計」語境略有差異。第四譯文語意清晰，用詞專業，但「計量」與「審計」搭配較為自然。第五譯文語意完整，但「計價」一詞在財務語境中不如「計量」常用。第六譯文語意準確，用詞專業，符合財務審計語境。\n綜合考量語法、語意與專業性，最佳譯文應使用「鑒於金額龐大且涉及的估計，以公允價值計量金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。」此譯文語意完整，用詞專業，符合財務審計語境。\n鑒於金額龐大且涉及的估計，以公允價值計量金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n審計程序包括對金融資產及金融負債按公允價值評估的程序：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is fluent and accurate, but the phrase \"以下內容\" (the following content) is implied rather than explicitly stated, which may be acceptable depending on context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** is also fluent and accurate, with a slightly more formal tone. It uses \"按公允價值計量\" (measured at fair value), which is a precise financial term in Chinese accounting.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** is concise but slightly awkward in structure, placing \"審計程序包括\" at the beginning, which may not be the most natural flow in Chinese.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** is grammatically correct but uses \"審核程序\" (audit procedures) and \"之\" (of), which is slightly more formal and less direct than necessary.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is accurate but slightly wordy, with \"有關...評估的審計程序包括\" (the audit procedures related to... assessment include), which is acceptable but not the most concise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** is concise but lacks clarity in the phrase \"公允價值之審計程序\" (audit procedures of fair value), which may be misinterpreted as the audit of fair value itself rather than the audit procedures for valuing at fair value.\n**Improved Translation:**\n審計程序包括對金融資產及金融負債按公允價值評估的程序：\n\n取得對評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債程序的了解，包括相關控制措施；\n\n評估和測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n評估和測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n\n取得關於財務資產及財務負債之估值、存在性、權利與義務及完整性的外部確認。\n\n在引用市場價格的情況下，運用獨立來源驗證價格；\n\n在運用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性及假設的合理性，並核對輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；以及\n---\n在運用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性及假設的合理性，並核對輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；以及\n\n在運用未根據可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性以及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產以公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日總值為港幣22,481百萬。集團亦持有二十二間合資企業的權益，總值為港幣44,506百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。此類估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所使用的估值方法及假設。\n\n審計程序一詞在所有翻譯中均正確使用「程序」，符合詞典要求。然而，「included」一詞在所有翻譯中均正確使用「包括」，也符合詞典要求。\n從語法和流暢度來看，各個翻譯基本正確，但存在一些細節差異。例如，「investment properties」翻譯為「投資物業」或「投資性不動產」，兩者皆可接受，但「投資性不動產」更符合會計專業術語。此外，「valuation of investment properties at fair value」的語序在不同翻譯中略有差異，影響整體語感。\n翻譯1語序較為自然，但「投資物業」略顯口語化。翻譯2使用「投資房地產」，與「不動產」相比，語感稍顯不專業。翻譯3語序較為混亂，影響理解。翻譯4使用「投資性不動產」，語感專業，但「計量」一詞與「估值」語意略有差異。翻譯5語序較為混亂，影響理解。翻譯6語序較為自然，但「評估」一詞與「估值」語意略有差異。\n綜合考慮語法、語感、專業術語和語意準確性，最佳翻譯應使用「投資性不動產」，並使用「估值」一詞，語序應為「審計程序包括」。\n審計按公允價值估值的投資性不動產程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是根據估值報告中列示的估值而定。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性，以及是否符合中文表達習慣與文化語境。此外，必須確保字典中指定的英文詞彙被正確翻譯為對應的繁體中文詞彙。\n1. **第一份翻譯**整體語句通順，用詞準確，符合中文語法與語境，且正確使用了「列示」與「根據」等字典指定詞彙。唯一可優化之處是「釐定」一詞略顯正式，與「定」相比稍顯冗長。\n2. **第二份翻譯**語句流暢，用詞準確，並正確使用了「列示」與「根據」。與第一份相比，「核實公平價值」比「確認公允價值」更符合財務語境，語氣更嚴謹。\n3. **第三份翻譯**語句通順，但「是否根據」的結構略顯猶豫，與原文的肯定語氣不完全一致。此外，「進行」一詞略顯冗餘。\n4. **第四份翻譯**語句通順，用詞準確，並正確使用了「基於」一詞，符合字典要求。然而，「合營企業」與「合資企業」在中文財務語境中略有差異，「合資企業」更常見於正式文件中。\n5. **第五份翻譯**存在明顯錯誤：將「held」翻譯為「舉辦」，與字典中「舉辦」不符，且語義完全錯誤。此處應為「持有」，而非「舉辦」，因此此翻譯不可接受。\n6. **第六份翻譯**同樣將「held」錯誤翻譯為「舉辦」，與字典不符，語義錯誤，因此也不可接受。\n**最佳翻譯考量：**\n在所有翻譯中，第二份與第四份表現最佳，語句通順、用詞準確、語氣恰當。第二份使用「核實公平價值」語氣更嚴謹，符合財務審計語境；第四份使用「合資企業」更符合常見用法。結合兩者優點，並修正語氣與語法，最終翻譯如下：\n取得及審閱集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是根據估值報告中列示的估值而定。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性和資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適合性以及假設和輸入的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2019年年度報告中所載的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對該等財務報表的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結果。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯得有重大錯誤。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我便有責任報告此事實。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"當局\" for \"authority\" and \"審計小組\" for \"audit sub-committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"發鈔銀行顧問委員會\" is incorrect; the original text refers to the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" not the \"Banknote Issuing Bank Advisory Committee.\" Also, the structure is slightly awkward.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"貨幣當局\" for \"Monetary Authority,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會\" is redundant and grammatically awkward. The term \"委員會\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"當局\" and \"審計小組.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"財務報表責任\" is awkward and lacks clarity. The phrase should be \"對財務報表的責任\" for better fluency.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"金融管理局\" for \"Monetary Authority,\" which is a common and accurate term in Hong Kong context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"聯繫基金\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"外匯基金.\" Also, \"審核委員會\" is not the exact match for \"audit sub-committee.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"貨幣當局\" and \"結匯基金\" (which is a close variant of \"外匯基金\").  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"審核委員會\" is not the exact match for \"audit sub-committee.\" Also, the structure is slightly awkward.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"貨幣當局\" and \"審計小組.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"貨幣基金\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"外匯基金.\" Also, the phrase \"顧問委員會\" is not the exact match for \"Advisory Committee.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n- \"貨幣當局\" is the most accurate and natural translation for \"Monetary Authority\" in the Hong Kong context.\n- \"外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組\" is the most accurate and natural translation for \"Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n- \"對財務報表的責任\" is the most fluent and grammatically correct way to express \"responsibilities for the financial statements.\"\nThus, the best possible translation is:  \n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣當局須根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《儲備基金條例》第7條作出的指令，負責編製真實及公允地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並制定貨幣當局認為必要的一切內部控制措施，以確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述的影響，無論該等錯誤陳述是因訛騙或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，同時採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate. It correctly uses \"監察\" for \"overseeing\" and translates \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" as \"交易所基金諮詢委員會,\" which is appropriate. The term \"審核小組\" is used for \"Audit Sub-Committee,\" which is acceptable. However, \"財務報告程序\" is slightly less natural than \"財務報告程序\" or \"財務報告流程.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses \"聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會\" which is incorrect. \"聯匯基金\" is not a standard term for \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"審核委員會\" is redundant and incorrect for \"Audit Sub-Committee.\" The term \"流程\" is more natural than \"程序\" in this context.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** misuses \"證券交易所基金顧問委員會\" which is not the correct name for the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Also, \"審計小組委員會\" is redundant and incorrect.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** incorrectly uses \"發行基金顧問委員會\" and includes an unnecessary apostrophe in \"集團’的,\" which is a grammatical error.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** uses \"香港儲備基金諮詢委員會\" which is incorrect. The \"Exchange Fund\" is not the same as the \"Hong Kong Reserve Fund.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses \"證券基金顧問委員會\" which is not the correct name for the \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" However, it correctly uses \"審計小組\" and \"流程.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\n交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否免於重大不正確陳述，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，並發行一份包括我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，總是能夠發現存在的重大不正確陳述。不正確陳述可能來自訛騙或錯誤，若個別或合計起來，可合理預期會影響基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的一部分，我在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷，並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n物色並評估財務報表重大錯報的風險，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我提出意見的基礎。未能察覺因訛騙所導致的重大錯報風險，高於因錯誤所導致的重大錯報風險，因為訛騙可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制。\n\n取得與審計相關的內部控制之了解，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用以對集團內部控制之成效發表意見。\n\n評估當局所運用的會計政策的適合性，以及其所作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n評估當局所運用的會計政策的適合性，以及其所作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n\n就貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎進行會計的適合性作出結論，並根據審計過程中取得的證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我必須在我的審計報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的關注，如果這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能會導致集團無法持續經營；\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露內容，以及財務報表是否以達成公平呈現的方式反映其底層交易及事件；並取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我維持對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我與證券基金諮詢委員會審計小組聯繫，有關審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦提供一份報告給發行基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們聯繫所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與基金會諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的內容，我決定哪些事項在審計現行期間財務報表時最具重要性，因此為關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許就該事項進行公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我決定該事項不應在報告中披露，因為披露後可能產生的不利後果將合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公眾利益福利。\n根據與基金會諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的內容，我決定哪些事項在審計現行期間財務報表時最具重要性，因此為關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許就該事項進行公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我決定該事項不應在報告中披露，因為披露後可能產生的不利後果將合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公眾利益福利。\n\n約翰·楚
