{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

Brexit referendum and the results of the US presidential election certainly rendered various polls as jokes, what was even more unexpected was the reaction of financial markets. Taking the US election as an example, news of Donald Trump's election victory caused the three major US stock futures to sharply decline before the market opened. However, shortly after the market opened, the US stock indices immediately rebounded and subsequently continued to rise, repeatedly setting new highs. This series of events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market movements, and also marked the significant uncertainty in the future development of the global situation.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial data points have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% by mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which reflects the dollar's performance against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end. Crude oil futures prices rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the start of the year to $54 per barrel by year-end. In Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, although the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. Against such volatile external conditions, the importance and value of financial system stability, especially monetary and banking stability, have become even more evident.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds targeting the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar spread widely, causing market anxiety. The HKMA swiftly conveyed a clear and resolute message to the market, emphasizing that we had absolute confidence and capability to defend the linked exchange rate system and ensure the stability of Hong Kong's financial system, timely restoring market confidence. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained closely aligned with the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, even the interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve in December 2015 and March 2016 did not immediately and significantly affect Hong Kong dollar interest rates or exchange rates.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in style, terminology, and phrasing. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is well-structured and uses appropriate terminology. However, it uses \"Banking Stability\" in uppercase at the end, which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry \"banking stability\" (lowercase). It also uses \"loan-to-value ratio\" instead of \"average loan-to-value ratio,\" which is slightly less precise.\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"debt servicing ratio\" instead of \"DSR,\" which is acceptable but less concise. It also uses \"remained at high levels above the statutory minimum requirements,\" which is slightly wordy.\n3. **Translation 3** is accurate and uses \"debt servicing ratio\" and \"countercyclical prudential measures\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"banking stability\" in lowercase, which is appropriate. However, it uses \"declined\" instead of \"fell\" or \"dropped,\" which is slightly less dynamic.\n4. **Translation 4** is very similar to Translation 1, with the same issue of \"Banking Stability\" in uppercase. It also uses \"DSR\" instead of \"debt servicing ratio,\" which is more concise but may be less clear to some readers.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and uses \"DSR\" consistently. It also uses \"fell\" and \"declined\" appropriately. However, it omits \"the\" before \"HKMA\" in the last sentence, which is slightly awkward.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most consistent with the dictionary, using \"banking stability\" in lowercase and \"debt servicing ratio\" instead of \"DSR.\" It also uses \"remained\" and \"declined\" appropriately. However, it uses \"strong\" instead of \"good\" for \"asset quality,\" which is a slight deviation from the original.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"banking stability\" in lowercase as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"debt servicing ratio\" for clarity, unless \"DSR\" is preferred for brevity.\n- Ensure consistency in verb usage (e.g., \"fell\" or \"declined\").\n- Maintain proper article usage (e.g., \"the HKMA\").\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated exactly as specified.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to develop steadily. Total loans recorded a moderate growth of 6.5% last year, with asset quality remaining good and the classified loan ratio maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, significantly lower than the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. Capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios of the banking system remain at high levels well above statutory minimum requirements. In the mortgage lending business, following seven rounds of countercyclical prudential measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential property mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the development of the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain banking stability.\n\nLegislative work to further strengthen banking system stability made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation—optimizing the Deposit Protection Scheme and addressing the \"too big to fail\" risks of financial institutions—were successfully passed before the previous Legislative Council term ended. The former accelerates the disbursement of deposit protection funds and simplifies the disbursement process, helping to enhance public confidence in the banking system. The latter establishes a resolution regime for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks that may arise if these institutions fail, and to minimize the need for public funds to bail them out. The HKMA has set up the Resolution Office on April 1 this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and follow up on related work.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in tone, terminology, and phrasing. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is well-structured and uses appropriate terminology. It correctly translates all dictionary terms and maintains a formal tone. However, it uses \"SMe\" inconsistently, switching between \"SMe\" and \"SMEs\" without clear justification.\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"SMes\" consistently and maintains a formal tone. However, it uses \"SMe Financing guarantee Scheme\" with a lowercase \"g\" in \"guarantee,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry.\n3. **Translation 3** is accurate and well-written. It uses \"SMEs\" consistently and provides a clear explanation of \"SMes\" as an abbreviation. However, it uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" instead of just \"HKMA,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n4. **Translation 4** is concise and accurate. It uses \"SMes\" consistently and correctly translates all dictionary terms. However, it uses \"the general public\" instead of \"ordinary citizens,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 3, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"SMes\" consistently and provides a clear explanation of the term. However, it uses \"the general public\" instead of \"ordinary citizens,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n6. **Translation 6** is well-written and accurate. It uses \"SMEs\" consistently and correctly translates all dictionary terms. However, it uses \"the backbone of all industries\" instead of \"the mother of all industries,\" which is a slight deviation from the original.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the formal tone of the original, use \"SMEs\" consistently, and ensure that all dictionary terms are translated exactly as specified. It would also use \"ordinary citizens\" instead of \"the general public\" to maintain the nuance of the original.\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe banking industry is often referred to as \"the mother of all industries,\" serving as a crucial channel for savings, payments, and credit for both the real economy and the daily lives of ordinary citizens. This year, some representatives from the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector have reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The HKMA immediately communicated with the banking sector, encouraging banks to continue providing financial support for the operations and development of SMEs while maintaining prudent risk management. We also strengthened the promotion of the government's \"SMe Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business community through our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, and maintained close communication with the banking sector to dispel concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for default cases, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the scheme. Through these combined efforts, certain positive results have been achieved. According to the HKMA's survey of banks, the overall credit facility limits for SMEs remained stable last year, with over 90% of businesses maintaining or even increasing their credit facility limits. At the same time, the number of applications for the \"SMe Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has also increased significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the HKMA has actively promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become an essential part of business operations and daily life. Last year, after we learned that some overseas companies and start-up companies were encountering difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately initiated follow-up actions, contacting multiple international chambers of commerce and SME associations, and engaging in in-depth communication with the banking industry to address the issues appropriately. In September last year, I issued a notice to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how they should understand the HKMA's \"risk-based\" regulatory principles regarding anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, and how these principles should be applied to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing customers. I emphasized that banks should not apply a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to all customers. After discussions between us, the banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but there is still room for progress, which is also one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of branch networks. The HKMA has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking service needs of the public while pursuing business profits. As financial technology advances rapidly, the channels through which banks provide services are becoming increasingly diversified. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, several banks launched mobile bank branches or video teller machines last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional automatic teller machines. With our promotion, several banks are also planning to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like rowing against the current. Therefore, the HKMA has continuously sought new opportunities and explored new areas for the development of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 can be considered a year of significant achievements, with fintech and infrastructure financing as key highlights.\n\nIn the field of financial technology, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. The HKMA issued 13 stored value facility (SVF) licences last year, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through its licensing and supervisory regime, supported by a series of public education campaigns, ensuring that consumers enjoy the convenience brought by new technologies while their rights and interests are properly protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote fintech development related to the banking industry through this platform. Within a few months, we launched several initiatives, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI), which established a tripartite platform centered on cybersecurity risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training to enhance the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong's banking sector. Furthermore, we established the Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking industry and the fintech sector. The Banking Supervision Department of the HKMA also set up the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS), enabling banks to test new technologies within a smaller and controlled environment, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have tested 14 new technology projects using the sandbox, with some projects already launched in the market, offering citizens more innovative fintech products.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. However, a critical review reveals several areas for improvement:\n1. **Consistency with the Dictionary**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"IFFO,\" \"infrastructure investment and financing,\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding.\" However, some translations use \"global Infrastructure Hub\" with a lowercase \"g\" (e.g., Translation 5), which should be \"Global Infrastructure Hub\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Most translations are grammatically sound, but some have minor issues. For example, Translation 5 uses \"global Infrastructure Hub\" with inconsistent capitalization. Translation 1 uses \"export-Import Bank of China\" with a lowercase \"e\" in \"export,\" which should be \"Export-Import Bank of China\" as per the dictionary.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness and Nuance**: The translations effectively convey the importance of Hong Kong as a financial hub and the role of IFFO in promoting infrastructure financing. However, some translations could be more precise in capturing the nuance of \"a focal point of attention both domestically and internationally\" (Translation 3) or \"laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future role as a hub\" (Translation 4).\n4. **Clarity and Precision**: Some translations use phrases like \"jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities\" (Translation 1), which is slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing like \"to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing\" (Translation 4) is preferable.\n5. **Word Choice and Style**: The use of \"operational history\" (Translation 4) is slightly formal and may be less natural than \"start-up time\" or \"establishment time.\" \"Laid a solid foundation\" is a common and effective phrase, but \"laid a solid groundwork\" could be an alternative.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all translations, ensuring consistency with the dictionary, fluency, and natural phrasing.\n---\nThe demand for infrastructure financing is significant worldwide, especially since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made it a focal point of international attention. Hong Kong, as Asia's international financial centre, holds distinct advantages in the field of infrastructure financing. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a new and unique platform to bring together over 60 world-class multilateral organisations, asset owners, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, infrastructure project developers and operators, and various professional institutions. These entities exchange information, share experiences, and explore cooperation opportunities on infrastructure investment and financing. Since its establishment, IFFO has held more than a dozen large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The HKMA has also signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank (CDB), and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its operational history is still relatively short, IFFO has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future development as a hub for infrastructure investment and financing.\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\nBreaking down barriers and loosening constraints is the surest way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the HKMA has actively participated in and supported the HKSAR government in revising the tax code to provide a favorable tax environment for companies operating corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. We have also actively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, terminology consistency, and stylistic nuance. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, with correct use of the dictionary terms. However, it uses \"14 billion yuan\" instead of \"140 billion yuan\" for the quota increase, which is a significant numerical error. This affects the credibility of the translation.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version uses \"ramifications\" for \"影響,\" which is a less common and slightly awkward choice in this context. It also uses \"bond market infrastructure connectivity\" instead of \"bond market infrastructure's connectivity,\" which is slightly less natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in tone and structure. It uses \"credit line for bilateral funding\" instead of \"total quota for bilateral liquidity support,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation. It also uses \"funding constraints\" instead of \"funds shortage,\" which is slightly more formal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"smoothly\" instead of \"orderly\" in the context of market operation, which is a slight stylistic choice but still appropriate. It also uses \"opening of the stock market\" for \"開通,\" which is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and natural. It uses \"leading center\" for \"牛耳,\" which is a good choice. It also uses \"liquidity shortages\" consistently and accurately. The only minor issue is the use of \"currently working with\" instead of \"working with,\" which is not incorrect but slightly less concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very accurate and consistent with the dictionary terms. It uses \"adding further momentum\" for \"再添動力,\" which is a good choice. It also uses \"enhance\" instead of \"optimize\" for \"優化,\" which is slightly different in tone but still appropriate.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and consistent with the dictionary terms. It should avoid numerical errors, use natural phrasing, and maintain the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above review, the sixth junior translator's version is the most accurate and consistent, with only minor stylistic variations that do not affect the overall quality.\n**Improved Translation**:\nLast year, the offshore renminbi market was in a period of adjustment. Affected by factors such as market volatility and expectations regarding the renminbi exchange rate, the scale of offshore renminbi liquidity pools globally generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong still maintained its leading position in offshore renminbi business, sustaining the world's largest renminbi liquidity pool, with renminbi settled through Hong Kong remaining at a high level of approximately 860 billion yuan per day. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong's offshore renminbi market, in October last year we increased the number of Primary Liquidity Providers from seven to nine, and raised the total quota for bilateral liquidity funding from the original 140 billion yuan to 180 billion yuan, ensuring that the market can continue to operate orderly even in the event of liquidity shortages in the offshore renminbi market. In December last year, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched, adding further momentum to Hong Kong's renminbi business. The HKMA is also working with relevant Mainland authorities to study the \"Bond Connect\" initiative, aiming to further facilitate participation of investors from both sides in the bond market and to enhance the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the global investment environment being fraught with various uncertainties last year, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income thanks to the multiple defensive measures taken over the past period. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund's compounded annual investment return has reached 4.8%, surpassing the同期 local inflation rate of 2.1%.\nThe first junior translator's translation is mostly accurate and fluent, but the use of \"the同期 local inflation rate\" is awkward and non-standard. The term \"同期\" is redundant in this context and should be omitted.\nTranslation by the second junior translator is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"plaguing\" effectively to convey the negative impact of instabilities, and \"exceeding the local inflation rate of 2.1% during the same period\" is clear and natural. However, \"deployments\" is slightly less precise than \"measures\" in this context.\nTranslation by the third junior translator is fluent and accurate, but it repeats \"last year\" unnecessarily. Also, \"which is higher than\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\nTranslation by the fourth junior translator is very good, with only a minor issue in the use of \"return rate\" instead of \"return.\" The phrase \"higher than the 2.1% local inflation rate during the same period\" is natural and clear.\nTranslation by the fifth junior translator is accurate and fluent, with only a minor issue in the phrasing \"for the same period,\" which is slightly less common than \"during the same period.\"\nTranslation by the sixth junior translator is very close to the best possible version. It is fluent, accurate, and uses natural phrasing. The only minor issue is the use of \"compounded annual investment return of the Exchange Fund\" which is slightly less direct than \"the Exchange Fund's compounded annual investment return.\"\nConsidering all the translations, the best possible version would retain the clarity and fluency of the second and fourth translations, while avoiding redundancy and ensuring natural phrasing.\nDespite various instabilities in the global investment environment last year, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past period. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund's compounded annual investment return has reached 4.8%, exceeding the local inflation rate of 2.1% during the same period.\nDespite various instabilities in the global investment environment last year, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past period.

Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **Translation 1** is well-structured and uses the correct terminology from the dictionary. However, it uses \"Capital preservation First, long-term growth next\" with a capital letter in \"First,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Capital preservation First\" (with a lowercase \"first\" in the second option). It also uses \"HKD\" consistently and correctly.\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"capital preservation first\" with a lowercase \"first,\" which aligns better with the dictionary's second option. It also uses \"since inception\" instead of \"to date,\" which is more precise in financial contexts.\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"HK$\" instead of \"HKD,\" which is less standard in formal financial reporting. It also uses \"Capital preservation First\" with a capital \"First,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's options. However, it uses \"reserve funds\" instead of \"contingency funds,\" which is a minor variation.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"long-term Growth portfolio\" with a capital \"Growth,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"long-term growth portfolio.\" It also uses \"HKD\" consistently and includes the correct terminology.\n5. **Translation 5** is very close to the best version, using \"long-term Growth portfolio\" with a capital \"Growth,\" which is inconsistent. It also uses \"HKD\" and \"reserve funds\" instead of \"contingency funds.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is the most consistent with the dictionary, using \"Capital preservation first, long-term growth next\" with lowercase \"first\" and \"next.\" It also uses \"HK$\" instead of \"HKD,\" which is less standard in formal contexts.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"long-term growth portfolio\" with lowercase \"growth\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"HKD\" consistently for Hong Kong dollars.\n- Use \"Capital preservation first, long-term growth next\" with lowercase \"first\" and \"next\" as per the dictionary's second option.\n- Use \"contingency funds\" instead of \"reserve funds\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"since inception\" instead of \"to date\" for precision in financial reporting.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-linked investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investments, the \"long-term growth portfolio\" invests in alternative assets through private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has maintained strong performance, with an average annualised internal rate of return of approximately 12% since inception. With part of the government's \"Future Fund\" allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the asset size of the \"long-term growth portfolio\" was approximately HKD 181.8 billion, with total approved but undrawn funds for investment amounting to approximately HKD 133.8 billion. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"Capital preservation first, long-term growth next,\" seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency funds.\n"}

Throughout the year, Hong Kong's stock market and residential property market have fluctuated, and housing affordability remains tight.\n\nDespite increased global market risks and shocks, Hong Kong's banking system remains robust. Banks' capital and liquidity conditions remain sound; asset quality has deteriorated slightly, but remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has remained stable, reflecting the Linked Exchange Rate System's ability to withstand external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. In December, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, Hong Kong's basic interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"風險管治架構\" as \"risk governance framework,\" \"普及金融\" as \"financial inclusion,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" and \"香港\" as \"Hong Kong.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"concrete actions,\" \"specific actions,\" and \"address the difficulties\" are all appropriate and convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Tense and Voice:** Some translations use the present continuous tense (\"is strengthening,\" \"is also taking\"), while others use the simple present (\"strengthens,\" \"takes\") or past tense (\"has strengthened,\" \"has also taken\"). The original text uses the present tense, so the most consistent and natural choice is the present continuous (\"is strengthening,\" \"is also taking\").\n- **Word Choice:** \"Concrete actions\" and \"specific actions\" are both acceptable, but \"specific actions\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like regulatory statements.\n- **\"Enterprises\" vs. \"Businesses\":** The original uses \"企業,\" which is best translated as \"businesses\" rather than \"enterprises,\" which may imply larger or more formal organizations.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations are slightly more fluent and natural than others. For example, \"address the difficulties businesses face when opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong\" is more natural than \"address the difficulties encountered by businesses in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use the present continuous tense for consistency with the original text.\n- Use \"specific actions\" as it is more commonly used in formal regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"businesses\" instead of \"enterprises\" to align with the original term \"企業.\"\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural in English, avoiding overly literal translations.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe HKMA is strengthening the risk governance framework of banks, as well as their credit, liquidity, and technology risk management. The HKMA is also taking specific actions to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties businesses face when opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six versions are largely accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and word choice that affect the overall readability and naturalness of the English translations.\nThe first junior translator uses \"Regarding regulatory policies,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less idiomatic than \"In terms of regulatory policies,\" used by others. The second and third translators use \"preparations for implementing\" and \"preparing for the implementation of,\" respectively. Both are correct, but \"preparing for the implementation of\" is more direct and commonly used in formal writing. The fourth and sixth translators use \"preparing Hong Kong to implement,\" which is slightly more active and clear, though \"preparing for the implementation of\" is also acceptable.\nThe use of \"regulatory policy\" (singular) in translations 4 and 6 is slightly less precise than \"regulatory policies\" (plural), which better matches the original Chinese term \"監管政策方面\" (in terms of regulatory policies). Additionally, the spelling of \"Ordinance\" in translations 1, 4, 5, and 6 is capitalized, which is correct as it refers to a specific legal document. However, in translation 2, it is lowercase, which is less appropriate in this context.\nTranslation 5 is the most balanced in terms of grammar, clarity, and adherence to the original structure. It uses \"In terms of regulatory policies,\" \"preparing for the implementation of,\" and correctly capitalizes \"Ordinance.\" It also maintains the exact terminology from the dictionary without unnecessary alterations.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and formality of translation 5, while ensuring that the term \"regulatory policies\" is used in the plural form to match the original Chinese, and that \"Ordinance\" is properly capitalized.\nIn terms of the dictionary terms, all translations correctly use \"Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance\" and \"resolution framework,\" and \"international supervisory and accounting standards\" as specified.\nThe final translation should be concise, grammatically sound, and maintain the formal tone of the original text while ensuring that all dictionary terms are used as specified.\nFinal Translation:  \nIn terms of regulatory policies, significant progress has been made in preparing for the implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub and asset management centre. The tax regime has been further refined to create a more favourable environment, attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The HKMA has successfully implemented the regulatory regime for stored value facilities and retail payment systems, and has issued 13 stored value facility licences.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the challenging investment environment filled with black swan events, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented in recent years, which enhanced its resilience.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and emphasis that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of the dictionary terms: \"investment environment,\" \"black swan events,\" \"defensive measures,\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" All translations maintain the core message that the Exchange Fund achieved a 2% return despite a difficult environment, thanks to prior defensive actions.\nWeaknesses include variations in sentence structure and flow. For instance, the fifth and sixth translations place \"thanks to\" earlier in the sentence, which disrupts the natural flow by separating the cause from the effect. The fifth translation also repeats \"the Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily, which can be streamlined. The sixth translation uses \"strengthening the Exchange Fund's resilience\" as a participle phrase, which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than using a relative clause or a comma-separated phrase.\nThe first, second, third, and fourth translations are more fluent and maintain a logical flow by placing the result (the 2% return) after the cause (the defensive measures). Among these, the first and fourth translations are particularly strong, with the fourth using \"fraught with\" instead of \"filled with,\" which is a more formal and precise expression in this context.\nImprovements could focus on enhancing the flow and reducing redundancy. For example, using \"fraught with\" instead of \"filled with\" adds a more formal tone, which is appropriate for a financial context. Also, using \"implemented\" instead of \"taken\" may be more precise when referring to formal measures. Finally, ensuring that the sentence structure clearly links the cause (defensive measures) with the effect (2% return) without unnecessary repetition or disruption.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and flow of the first and fourth translations while incorporating the more formal tone of \"fraught with\" and ensuring grammatical precision and natural phrasing.\nDespite a challenging investment environment fraught with black swan events, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented in recent years, which enhanced its resilience.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and focused on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) accelerating its investment diversification, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio. The dictionary provides three acceptable translations for \"長期增長組合\" and one for \"金管局\" (HKMA). All junior translators have used \"HKMA\" correctly, though some omitted the article \"The\" before it, which is stylistically acceptable but less formal.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The HKMA is accelerating the pace of diversifying investments, particularly in the long-term Growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"HKMA\" with \"The,\" accurate translation of \"長期增長組合\" as \"long-term Growth portfolio\" (with capitalization of \"Growth\" which is not ideal).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Diversifying investments\" is slightly awkward; \"diversified investment efforts\" or \"diversified investments\" would be smoother.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The HKMA is accelerating its diversified investment efforts, particularly in investments in the long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"HKMA\" and \"long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Repetition of \"investments in\" is redundant and awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The HKMA is accelerating the pace of diversified investments, particularly those in the long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Smooth phrasing, correct use of \"HKMA\" and \"long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Those in\" is slightly vague and could be more direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The HKMA is accelerating the pace of diversified investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear, concise, and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None notable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"HKMA is accelerating the pace of diversified investment, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omission of \"The\" before \"HKMA\" makes it less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"HKMA is accelerating the pace of diversification of investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"long-term growth portfolio.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Diversification of investments\" is wordy and less natural than \"diversified investments.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and natural in English. It should also use the correct term from the dictionary for \"長期增長組合\" and \"金管局.\" The fourth junior translator's version is the most natural and concise, with the correct use of \"HKMA\" and \"long-term growth portfolio.\" However, \"accelerating the pace of diversified investments\" could be slightly refined for clarity and flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA is accelerating its diversified investment efforts, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintaining communication with society and the market through various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and operations. The dictionary specifies that \"金管局\" must be translated as \"HKMA.\"\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"the HKMA\" consistently and includes \"enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations.\" The use of \"the\" before \"HKMA\" is appropriate in formal contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also accurate. It uses \"public education initiatives\" instead of \"activities,\" which is a slight variation but still acceptable. The phrase \"the public's understanding\" is slightly more natural than \"public understanding.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second, with the same strengths and no notable weaknesses.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation omits \"the\" before \"HKMA\" in the first instance, which is less formal and slightly less appropriate in a formal context. However, the rest of the sentence is fluent and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is very similar to the first and second translations. It uses \"thereby\" instead of \"enhancing,\" which is a slight stylistic difference but still correct. The use of \"other channels\" is more concise than \"other various channels.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version uses \"the community\" instead of \"society,\" which is a minor but meaningful change. \"Community\" may be narrower in scope than \"society,\" which could affect the intended meaning. The rest of the translation is accurate and fluent.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use \"the HKMA\" consistently, and ensure clarity and fluency. \"Public education activities\" is more literal and appropriate than \"initiatives\" in this context. \"Society\" is broader and more accurate than \"community.\" The use of \"thereby\" is slightly more formal and connects the clauses more clearly. \"Other various channels\" is redundant; \"other channels\" is more concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with society and the market through the media, public education activities, and other channels, thereby enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. The use of \"exercising strict financial discipline\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"strictly controlling financial discipline,\" but it is still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the original in structure and meaning. The phrase \"strictly controlling financial discipline\" is more natural than \"exercising strict financial discipline.\" The use of \"increasingly heavy workloads\" is also appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second, with the only difference being the use of \"to address the challenges posed by\" instead of \"in order to meet the challenges brought about by.\" \"Address\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"meet.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses \"by promoting employees' professional development\" and \"to address the challenges posed by,\" which are both natural and fluent. The phrase \"growing workload\" is slightly less precise than \"increasingly heavy workloads\" or \"increasingly demanding workloads.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original, with the only difference being the use of \"staff\" instead of \"employees.\" While \"staff\" is acceptable, \"employees\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like this.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the second and fifth, with the only difference being the use of \"promoting professional development for employees.\" This is slightly more wordy than \"promoting employees' professional development.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"strictly controlling financial discipline\" is more natural than \"exercising strict financial discipline.\"\n- \"To address the challenges posed by\" is more formal and precise than \"in order to meet the challenges brought about by.\"\n- \"Increasingly demanding workloads\" is more idiomatic and conveys the sense of increasing pressure more effectively than \"increasingly heavy workloads\" or \"growing workload.\"\n- \"Employees\" is more commonly used in formal contexts than \"staff.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen corporate governance, including promoting employees' professional development, strictly controlling financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security, to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n"}

English. The junior translators have provided several variations of the translation, with the most common being \"January 14th\" and \"January 14.\" The use of \"14th\" is more formal and commonly used in English for dates, while \"14\" is more informal or abbreviated.\nAll translations are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, the most natural and standard English format for a date like this would be \"January 14th,\" which is consistent with how dates are typically written in English-speaking countries. The use of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary and does not appear in the original Chinese text, so it should be omitted.\nBased on these considerations, \"January 14th\" is the most appropriate and natural translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are all largely accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong,\" and \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and grammatically correct.\n- The use of \"increased to,\" \"raised to,\" and \"effective\" or \"as of\" are all appropriate in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"applicable in Hong Kong from January 1, 2017,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"effective January 1, 2017\" or \"from January 1, 2017.\"\n- The third translation uses \"applicable to Hong Kong,\" which is slightly less precise than \"applicable in Hong Kong\" or \"effective in Hong Kong.\"\n- The fourth and fifth translations use \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer\" with a capital \"C,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry, which lists it in lowercase. However, this is a minor issue and may be due to stylistic choices.\n- The use of \"raised\" versus \"increased\" is interchangeable, but \"increased\" is more commonly used in formal announcements.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"effective\" or \"from\" to indicate the start date, as these are more standard in formal announcements.\n- Ensure consistency in capitalization of \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"applicable in Hong Kong\" to maintain clarity and precision.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer applicable in Hong Kong will be increased to 1.25% effective January 1, 2017.\n\n# February\n\n# February 5th\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about regulatory proposals by two financial authorities. The junior translators have all correctly used the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),\" \"mandatory clearing,\" \"mandatory reporting,\" and \"over-the-counter derivatives regulatory regime.\" This is a strong foundation.\nHowever, there are differences in the choice of verbs and prepositions that affect the tone and clarity of the translation. The first, fourth, and sixth translations use \"issued,\" while the second uses \"published,\" and the third and fifth use \"have published\" and \"their proposal,\" respectively. \"Issued\" and \"published\" are both acceptable, but \"published\" is more commonly used in the context of official documents like consultation summaries. The use of \"their proposal\" in the fifth translation introduces a possessive that is not present in the original, which may imply a narrower scope than intended.\nThe second translation uses \"consultation conclusions paper,\" which is slightly awkward and not standard phrasing. The correct term is \"consultation summary,\" as used in the other translations. The third translation uses \"the proposal\" instead of \"proposals,\" which is less accurate since the original refers to multiple proposals.\nThe best translations are the first, fourth, and sixth, which are nearly identical and use the most natural phrasing. The fourth translation uses \"regarding\" instead of \"on,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The first and sixth translations are the most concise and natural.\nImprovements would focus on consistency in verb choice and preposition usage. \"Published\" is more appropriate than \"issued\" in this context, and \"on proposals\" is more direct than \"regarding proposals.\" The possessive \"their\" should be omitted to maintain the neutrality of the original text.\nFinal translation:\nThe HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) have published a consultation summary on proposals to introduce mandatory clearing and expand mandatory reporting under the over-the-counter derivatives regulatory regime.\n\n# March\n\n# March 21st\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a Fintech Facilitation Office with the goal of promoting Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are variations in tense, prepositions, and word choice that affect fluency and precision.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The HKMA established a Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"established\" and \"a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"a Fintech Facilitation Office\" should be \"the Fintech Facilitation Office\" since it refers to a specific entity. Also, \"fintech hub\" is slightly less precise than \"financial technology hub\" or \"fintech hub in Asia.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"HKMA establishes Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing article before \"HKMA\" and \"Fintech Facilitation Office.\" Also, the use of present tense \"establishes\" may not align with the original context, which implies a completed action.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"the Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"established.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing article before \"HKMA.\" Also, \"fintech hub\" is slightly less precise than \"financial technology hub.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The HKMA has established the Fintech Facilitation Office to drive Hong Kong's development as a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"the Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"has established.\" The verb \"drive\" adds nuance.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"drive Hong Kong's development\" is slightly more verbose than necessary and may not be the most direct translation of the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"HKMA establishes the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"the Fintech Facilitation Office.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing article before \"HKMA\" and use of present tense \"establishes\" may not align with the original context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a regional fintech hub in Asia.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"the Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"established.\" The addition of \"regional\" adds clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"regional fintech hub\" is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, use appropriate articles, and maintain the original meaning with natural phrasing. It should also use the exact term \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" and \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary. The verb tense should reflect a completed action, and the phrase \"fintech hub in Asia\" is concise and accurate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\n# May\n\n# May 16th\n\nHKMA announced that the Coin Collection programme will be extended for another two years until September 2018.\n\n# May 18th\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, structure, and word choice that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Cyber Security Summit 2016,\" \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" \"Hong Kong,\" and \"cyber resilience.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the main clause being \"The HKMA announced the launch of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative at the Cyber Security Summit 2016,\" followed by a clause indicating the purpose or effect of the initiative.\n- The use of \"further enhancing\" is appropriate and conveys the progressive nature of the initiative.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** Some translations use quotation marks around \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative\" (e.g., Translation 2 and 3), which is acceptable but not necessary unless the initiative has an official title with specific formatting.\n- **Word Order and Flow:** Translation 6 uses \"the banking sector in Hong Kong,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise than \"Hong Kong's banking sector.\"\n- **Verb Choice:** Translation 2 uses \"to further enhance,\" which is slightly more direct than the others, which use \"further enhancing.\" While both are correct, \"to further enhance\" may be more natural in this context as it clearly indicates the purpose of the initiative.\n**Improvements:**\n- Maintain consistency in punctuation and quotation usage.\n- Use \"further enhancing\" or \"to further enhance\" based on whether the sentence is structured as a result or a purpose.\n- Ensure that \"Hong Kong's banking sector\" is used for clarity and conciseness.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the launch of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative at the Cyber Security Summit 2016 to further enhance the cyber resilience of Hong Kong’s banking sector.\nThe HKMA announced the launch of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative at the Cyber Security Summit 2016 to further enhance the cyber resilience of Hong Kong’s banking sector.\n\n# June\n\n# June 1–2\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局與中國銀行業監督管理委員會合辦香港銀行獨立非執行董事高級研修班。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organized the Hong Kong Banking Sector Senior Training Program for independent non-executive directors.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms, clear structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Hong Kong Banking Sector Senior Training Program\" is slightly awkward and less direct than \"advanced training program.\" Also, \"senior\" may not fully capture the nuance of \"高級\" in this context.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission co-hosted an advanced training course for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Natural phrasing, accurate use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"co-hosted\" is slightly less formal than \"jointly organized,\" and \"course\" may not be as precise as \"program\" for a structured training event.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organized an advanced training course for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Missing the article \"The\" before \"HKMA\" and \"China Banking Regulatory Commission,\" which is standard in formal writing.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organized an advanced training program for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms, natural and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None significant. This is a strong candidate.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organized an advanced training program for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Identical to Translation 4.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organize the Advanced Training Program for Independent Non-Executive Directors of Hong Kong Banks.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Advanced Training Program\" with capitalization, which may be appropriate for a formal title.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Missing the article \"The\" before \"HKMA,\" and the use of all caps may be overly formal unless it's a proper title.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"Jointly organized\" is more formal and appropriate for official events than \"co-hosted.\"\n- \"Advanced training program\" is more precise and formal than \"course.\"\n- The use of \"the\" before \"HKMA\" and \"China Banking Regulatory Commission\" is standard in formal English.\n- \"Independent non-executive directors\" is correctly translated and should remain in lowercase unless it's a formal title.\n- \"Hong Kong banks\" is more natural than \"Hong Kong Banking Sector.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly organized an advanced training program for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\n\n# June 3rd\n\nThe original text announces the gazetting of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016, which allows companies to deduct interest expenses from intra-group financing under specified conditions and provides tax incentives for corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"came into force\" instead of \"gazetted,\" which is less accurate. Also, \"related to\" is slightly vague compared to \"from\" or \"on.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"published\" instead of \"gazetted,\" which is not the correct legal term. \"Provided that specified conditions are met\" is slightly wordy.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Correctly uses \"gazetted\" and includes the acronym \"CtCs\" for clarity. However, \"from intra-group financing business\" is slightly awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and \"subject to specified conditions,\" which is more natural. \"Related to\" is slightly vague.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and \"for Hong Kong’s corporate treasury centres,\" which is natural. However, \"from intra-group financing business\" is awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and \"under specified conditions,\" which is natural. \"On intra-group financing business\" is more precise than \"from.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"gazetted\" as it is the correct legal term. It should use \"under specified conditions\" for clarity and natural phrasing. The phrase \"interest expenses on intra-group financing business\" is more precise than \"from\" or \"related to.\" Including the acronym \"CtCs\" adds clarity for readers familiar with the term. The phrase \"providing tax incentives for corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong\" is natural and accurate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 was gazetted, allowing companies to deduct interest expenses on intra-group financing business under specified conditions, and providing tax incentives for corporate treasury centres (CtCs) in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 10th\n\nThe original text discusses the gazetting of the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016, which introduces a new structure for open-ended fund companies, thereby diversifying Hong Kong's fund domiciliation platform. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology, verb choice, and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"Hong Kong,\" \"Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016,\" \"fund domiciliation platform,\" and \"open-ended fund company.\"\n- Most translations use \"gazetted\" or \"published,\" both of which are acceptable for \"刊憲,\" though \"gazetted\" is more precise in legal contexts.\n- The phrase \"introducing a new structure for open-ended fund companies\" is more natural than \"of open-ended fund company.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and third translations use \"of open-ended fund company,\" which is grammatically awkward and less natural than \"for open-ended fund companies.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"more diverse,\" which is less formal and less precise than \"more diversified\" in a legal or regulatory context.\n- The third and sixth translations use \"thereby making\" or \"thereby diversifying,\" which are both acceptable, but \"thereby diversifying\" is more concise and direct.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"gazetted\" instead of \"published\" for \"刊憲\" to reflect the formal legal process.\n- Use \"for open-ended fund companies\" instead of \"of open-ended fund company\" for grammatical accuracy and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"thereby diversifying\" instead of \"thereby making... more diversified\" for conciseness and clarity.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would use \"gazetted,\" \"for open-ended fund companies,\" and \"thereby diversifying.\"\nThe Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 was gazetted, introducing a new structure for open-ended fund companies, thereby diversifying Hong Kong's fund domiciliation platform.\n\n# June 20th\n# 6月20日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, particularly in headings or titles. The junior translators have all provided translations that are largely correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"June 20th\"** – This is correct and follows standard English date formatting. It omits the \"#\" symbol, which may or may not be necessary depending on context.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"June 20th\"** – Same as the first, and equally correct.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# June 20\"** – This includes the \"#\" symbol and uses \"June 20\" without the \"th\" suffix. While the \"#\" may be stylistically appropriate in some contexts, the omission of \"th\" is less standard in English date formatting.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# June 20th\"** – This includes the \"#\" symbol and uses the correct date format with \"th.\" This is the most consistent with the original format.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"June 20th\"** – Same as the first and second, and correct.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"June 20th\"** – Same as the first, second, and fifth, and correct.\n**Reasoning for improvement:**\n- The \"#\" symbol is present in the original text, so it should be retained in the translation to maintain consistency with the original format.\n- The use of \"June 20th\" is standard in English for dates, and the \"th\" suffix is appropriate.\n- Therefore, the best translation would be \"# June 20th,\" which preserves both the original formatting and the correct English date format.\n# June 20th\n\nThe original sentence is: \"在政府債券計劃下發行第六批零售通脹掛鈎債券(iBond)。\" The dictionary provides exact translations for the key terms: \"iBond\" remains as \"iBond\", \"政府債券計劃\" is \"government Bond programme\", and \"零售通脹掛鈎債券\" is \"inflation-linked retail bond\".\n**Review of the junior translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Under the government Bond programme, the sixth batch of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) is issued.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper structure, and clear meaning.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"government Bond programme\" should be \"government bond programme\" (lowercase \"bond\" unless it's a proper noun). Also, \"is issued\" is passive and slightly less dynamic than alternatives.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Issue the sixth batch of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) under the government Bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Active voice, correct terminology.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"government Bond programme\" should be \"government bond programme\", and the sentence is a command form, which may not be appropriate for a news-style statement.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The sixth batch of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) is issued under the government bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper grammar, and passive voice is appropriate for news reporting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"is issued\" is passive, which is acceptable but could be more dynamic.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The sixth tranche of inflation-linked retail bond (iBond) is being issued under the government Bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Use of \"tranche\" is more formal and appropriate in financial contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"retail bond\" should be \"retail bonds\" (plural), and \"government Bond programme\" should be \"government bond programme\".\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The sixth batch of inflation-linked retail bond (iBond) is issued under the government Bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"retail bond\" should be \"retail bonds\", and \"government Bond programme\" should be \"government bond programme\".\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The sixth batch of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) was issued under the government bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms, proper grammar.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"was issued\" is in the past tense, which may not be appropriate if the issuance is ongoing or recent.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- \"Batch\" is acceptable, but \"tranche\" is more commonly used in financial contexts for structured bond issues.\n- \"Inflation-linked retail bonds\" should be plural.\n- \"Government bond programme\" should be lowercase unless it's a proper name.\n- The use of passive voice is appropriate for news-style reporting.\n- The tense should be present (\"is issued\") unless the issuance is clearly in the past.\n**Improved translation:**\nThe sixth tranche of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) is issued under the government bond programme.\n\n# June 30th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section marker. The junior translators have provided several variations of the date, with most correctly translating \"6月30日\" as \"June 30th\" or \"June 30.\" The use of \"June 30th\" is more common in English for dates, especially when used in formal or written contexts. However, the presence of the \"#\" symbol in some translations (e.g., \"# June 30\") is questionable, as it may not be necessary unless the original text is part of a larger document with section headings.\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be \"June 30th,\" as it aligns with standard English date formatting and omits the unnecessary \"#\" symbol unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement not indicated in the original text.\n\nThe original text is a formal legal statement announcing the gazetting of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, which provides a legal foundation for establishing a cross-sector resolution regime in Hong Kong. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in terminology and phrasing that affect fluency and precision.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"published\" instead of \"gazetted,\" which is less precise in legal contexts. The rest is accurate and fluent.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted,\" which is the correct legal term, and the sentence is well-structured. This is a strong translation.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" correctly but adds \"for financial institutions\" unnecessarily, which is not in the original text and may mislead the reader.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"published in the Gazette,\" which is redundant and less concise than \"gazetted.\" The rest is accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and \"has been\" for the verb tense, which is grammatically correct and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and includes \"for financial institutions,\" which is not in the original text and is therefore inaccurate.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"gazetted\" as it is the standard legal term for the formal publication of legislation. The phrase \"providing the legal basis for establishing\" is more concise and natural than \"providing a legal basis for the establishment of.\" The inclusion of \"for financial institutions\" is not supported by the original text and should be omitted. The use of \"has been gazetted\" is grammatically correct and appropriate for a formal statement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance has been gazetted, providing the legal basis for establishing a cross-sector resolution regime in Hong Kong.\n\n# July\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with two international organizations to promote investment and financing in Asian infrastructure projects via the IFFO platform. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and all junior translators have used these correctly.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Memorandums of Understanding\" and correctly identifies the organizations. However, \"via the IFFO platform\" is slightly less formal than \"through the IFFO platform.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"infrastructure projects in Asia\" instead of \"Asian infrastructure projects,\" which is slightly more natural in English. The use of \"through the IFFO platform\" is appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The use of \"has signed\" is grammatically correct but slightly less direct than the simple past tense used in other translations. The structure \"promoting investment...\" is a bit less formal than \"to promote investment...\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"facilitating\" instead of \"promoting,\" which is a slight variation in meaning but still acceptable. The phrase \"infrastructure projects in Asia\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"investment and financing in Asian infrastructure projects,\" which is slightly more concise than \"infrastructure projects in Asia.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and includes the word \"separately,\" which is present in the original Chinese. However, the original does not explicitly state that the MOUs were signed separately, so this addition may be unnecessary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and natural in English. It should use the correct terms from the dictionary and maintain the formal tone of the original. The phrase \"infrastructure projects in Asia\" is more natural in English than \"Asian infrastructure projects.\" The use of \"through the IFFO platform\" is more standard than \"via the IFFO platform.\" The verb \"promote\" is more appropriate than \"facilitate\" in this context, as the original text emphasizes promoting investment and financing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Hub to promote investment and financing for infrastructure projects in Asia through the IFFO platform.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established an office to promote Hong Kong's development as an infrastructure financing hub. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in tense, formality, and phrasing that affect fluency and naturalness.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"established\" in the simple past tense, which is appropriate for a completed action. The phrasing is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"established\" and \"development into\" instead of \"as.\" While \"into\" is grammatically acceptable, \"as\" is more idiomatic in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses the present tense \"establishes,\" which is incorrect in this context, as the establishment of the office is a completed event.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"has established,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal and less concise than the simple past tense.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Matches the first in tense and phrasing, and is clear and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"has established\" and \"Hong Kong’s\" with an apostrophe, which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the simple past tense \"established\" to reflect a completed action, avoid unnecessary formality, and use \"as\" for clarity and naturalness. The phrase \"promote Hong Kong's development as an infrastructure financing hub\" is the most idiomatic and concise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to promote Hong Kong's development as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\n# July 5th\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting the nature of an official announcement. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning, but there are variations in phrasing and minor differences in the theme's wording.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Boao Forum for Asia,\" \"Financial Cooperation Conference,\" and \"Hong Kong.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is largely accurate, with all translations conveying that the event was co-hosted in Hong Kong.\n- The use of \"co-hosted\" or \"jointly hosted\" is appropriate and reflects the collaborative nature of the event.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and third translations use \"jointly hosted\" and \"co-hosted\" respectively, both of which are acceptable, but \"co-hosted\" is slightly more concise and commonly used in such contexts.\n- The fourth translation uses \"Financial Support for the Real Economy\" instead of \"Finance Promoting the Real Economy.\" While both are semantically similar, the original phrase \"金融促進實體經濟\" more directly translates to \"Finance Promoting the Real Economy,\" making the fourth translation slightly less accurate.\n- The fifth and sixth translations are nearly identical, with the only difference being the use of \"the\" before \"HKMA\" in the sixth. However, \"HKMA\" is an acronym and typically does not require an article unless it's part of a larger phrase.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"co-hosted\" for conciseness and clarity.\n- Retain the exact phrase \"Finance Promoting the Real Economy\" to ensure fidelity to the original.\n- Omit the article \"the\" before \"HKMA\" as it is a proper noun and does not require it in this context.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Boao Forum for Asia co-hosted the Financial Cooperation Conference in Hong Kong with the theme \"Finance Promoting the Real Economy.\"\n\n# July 20\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, conveying the initiation of a financial system between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong. The junior translators have all correctly used the term \"joint e-Cheque clearing\" from the dictionary, which is appropriate. However, there are minor differences in the verbs used: \"launched\" and \"initiated\" are both acceptable, but \"launched\" is more commonly used in the context of starting a new system or service. Additionally, the spelling of \"e-Cheque\" is inconsistent across translations, with some using \"e-cheque\" (lowercase 'c'). The correct form, as per the dictionary, is \"e-Cheque\" with a capital 'C'.\nThe best translation would use \"launched\" and maintain the correct capitalization of \"e-Cheque\".\nThe joint e-Cheque clearing between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been launched.\n\n# August\n\n# August 12th\nThe original text is a simple date format, \"8月12日,\" which translates to \"August 12th\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, with the most common being \"August 12th\" and \"August 12.\" The use of \"12th\" is more appropriate in English for dates, as it follows the ordinal number format. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in some translations is unnecessary and does not appear in the original text, so it should be omitted. The best translation is \"August 12th,\" which is both grammatically correct and culturally appropriate.\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行首批銀色債券,\" translates to \"Issue the first batch of Silver Bonds under the government Bond programme.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"The first Silver Bond was issued under the government Bond programme.\" This translation is grammatically correct and fluent, but it uses \"Silver Bond\" (singular) instead of \"Silver Bonds\" (plural), which may not align with the original meaning of \"首批銀色債券\" (first batch of Silver Bonds). Additionally, the use of \"was issued\" implies a completed action, which is appropriate but slightly less dynamic than the original.\nTranslation 2: \"The initial issuance of Silver Bonds under the government Bond programme.\" This is concise and grammatically sound, but it omits the verb \"to issue\" and instead uses \"issuance,\" which is more formal and less direct than the original sentence.\nTranslation 3: \"The first batch of Silver Bonds are issued under the government Bond programme.\" This translation is grammatically correct but uses the present tense \"are issued,\" which may not be the best fit for a completed action like the issuance of bonds.\nTranslation 4: \"Issue the first batch of Silver Bonds under the government Bond programme.\" This is a direct and active translation that closely mirrors the original sentence structure. It uses the imperative form \"Issue,\" which is appropriate for a statement about an action that has been taken.\nTranslation 5: \"The first issue of Silver Bonds under the government Bond programme.\" This is similar to Translation 2 and is concise, but it uses \"issue\" as a noun, which may not fully capture the action described in the original sentence.\nTranslation 6: \"Under the government Bond programme, the first batch of Silver Bonds was issued.\" This translation is grammatically correct and uses the past tense \"was issued,\" which is appropriate for a completed action. However, the structure is slightly more complex than necessary and may be less direct than the original.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use a clear and direct structure that reflects the original sentence's meaning and tense. The use of \"were issued\" would be more appropriate than \"was issued\" because \"Silver Bonds\" is a plural noun. Additionally, the phrase \"first batch\" is more natural in English than \"initial issuance\" or \"first issue.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be: \"The first batch of Silver Bonds was issued under the government Bond programme.\" This translation is grammatically correct, uses the appropriate tense, and accurately reflects the original sentence's meaning.\n\n# August 25th\n# 8月25日\nThe original text is a simple date format commonly used in Chinese contexts, where the month and day are written in numerical form with the month preceding the day. The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in formatting that could be refined for consistency and clarity.\nThe first, third, and fifth translations use \"August 25th,\" which is grammatically correct and commonly used in English-speaking countries. The second and fourth translations use \"August 25,\" which is also acceptable but lacks the ordinal indicator \"th.\" The sixth translation uses \"# August 25th,\" which includes an unnecessary hashtag symbol that does not appear in the original text and is not standard in English date formatting.\nThe best possible translation would be \"August 25th,\" as it is the most natural and widely accepted format in English for expressing dates in this context. It is grammatically correct, clear, and does not include any extraneous symbols.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"granted\" and \"SVF issuers\" appropriately. However, it omits the parenthetical reference to \"the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" as \"(PSSVFO)\" which is present in the original text.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is accurate and includes the parenthetical \"(PSSVFO)\" as in the original. However, it uses \"stored value facility issuers\" twice, which is redundant and could be streamlined.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is very similar to the second, but it adds \"(SVF)\" in parentheses after \"stored value facility licences,\" which is not present in the original. This may be unnecessary unless the acronym is needed for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is concise and grammatically sound. It uses \"announced the issuance of\" which is slightly more formal than \"announced that it has issued,\" but still appropriate. It omits the parenthetical \"(PSSVFO)\" which is present in the original.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is very similar to the second, but it uses \"the PSSVFO\" instead of \"PSSVFO\" in parentheses. This is slightly less consistent with the original's formatting.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is the most consistent with the original in terms of structure and terminology. It uses \"issued\" and \"SVF issuers\" appropriately, and includes the parenthetical \"(PSSVFO)\" as in the original. It also avoids redundancy by using \"SVF\" consistently.\n**Reasoning for improvement**: The best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and consistent with the original's structure and terminology. It should also include the parenthetical \"(PSSVFO)\" as in the original. The use of \"SVF\" as an acronym is appropriate and concise, and should be used consistently. Redundancy in the use of \"stored value facility issuers\" should be avoided.\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA announced that it has issued the first batch of stored value facility (SVF) licences to five SVF issuers under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).\n\n# September\n\n# September 6\n\nThe original sentence is concise and straightforward, and the junior translators have all captured the core meaning. However, there are several nuances and stylistic choices that can be refined for clarity, fluency, and grammatical correctness.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"jointly organized\" and includes \"The\" before the summit title. While grammatically correct, \"organized\" is less common in formal event announcements compared to \"hosted\" or \"co-hosted.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"co-hosted\" and includes \"The\" before the summit title. The use of \"co-hosted\" is appropriate, but the inclusion of \"The\" before the event name is redundant, as the event name already includes \"The.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Same as the second, but with \"HKMA\" without \"The.\" This is acceptable, but the use of \"The\" before the event name is still redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Omitting \"The\" before the event name is a good choice, and \"co-hosted\" is appropriate. However, the quotation marks are missing around the event name, which is a minor but important stylistic issue.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Correctly uses \"co-hosted\" and quotation marks, and omits \"The\" before the event name. This is the most fluent and stylistically appropriate version so far.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"jointly hosted\" and quotation marks. \"Jointly hosted\" is slightly more formal and appropriate for official events. However, the use of \"The\" before the event name is still redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- **Verb Choice:** \"Co-hosted\" is more commonly used in event announcements than \"organized\" or \"jointly hosted,\" as it clearly conveys collaboration.\n- **Article Usage:** The event name \"The Treasury Markets Summit 2016\" already includes \"The,\" so adding another \"The\" before it is redundant and should be omitted.\n- **Quotation Marks:** The event name should be enclosed in quotation marks to denote it as a proper noun or title.\n- **Fluency and Style:** The sentence should be concise and natural, avoiding unnecessary words or redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Treasury Markets Association co-hosted \"The Treasury Markets Summit 2016\" in Hong Kong.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\nStrengths across all translations include the correct use of \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\" for \"金融科技監管沙盒,\" which aligns with the dictionary specifications. All translations effectively communicate the idea that the HKMA has introduced a regulatory framework for banks to test new technologies before full deployment.\nWeaknesses include variations in verb choice (e.g., \"test,\" \"pilot,\" \"conduct trials\") and phrasing (e.g., \"before their full launch,\" \"before full-scale implementation\"). While these variations are not incorrect, they affect the tone and formality of the translation. For instance, \"conduct trials\" is more formal and precise, while \"test\" is more general. \"Pilot\" is commonly used in regulatory contexts and may be more appropriate.\nAdditionally, some translations use \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is acceptable but less concise. The use of \"technological initiatives\" is slightly more verbose than \"technology initiatives\" and may not be necessary in this context.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would use \"pilot\" as it is a standard term in regulatory and financial contexts, and it conveys the idea of testing in a controlled environment. It would also use \"fintech\" for brevity and clarity, and \"before full-scale implementation\" to maintain a formal and precise tone.\nThe final translation should be concise, accurate, and maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory announcements.\nThe HKMA has launched the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to pilot fintech and other technology initiatives before full-scale implementation.\n\n# September 28\n\nThe original sentence is concise and clear, and the junior translators have mostly captured its meaning. However, there are several areas for improvement in terms of fluency, grammar, and the use of prepositions.\nFirst, the phrase \"capitalising the rising China opportunities\" is grammatically incorrect. The correct preposition to use with \"capitalising\" is \"on,\" making it \"capitalising on the rising China opportunities.\" This error appears in all translations except for the third and fifth, which use \"capitalising on.\"\nSecond, the use of \"to promote\" versus \"promoting\" is a matter of style. While both are grammatically correct, \"to promote\" adds a sense of purpose and intention, which may be more appropriate in this context.\nThird, the use of \"The HKMA\" versus \"HKMA\" is a matter of style and formality. Since the original text does not use the definite article \"the,\" it may be more appropriate to omit it unless the context requires it for clarity.\nFourth, the phrase \"hosted a seminar in Frankfurt, Germany\" is clear and concise. However, the addition of \"held in\" in the second translation is redundant and can be omitted for brevity.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would use \"capitalising on the rising China opportunities,\" include \"to promote\" for clarity of purpose, and omit the definite article \"the\" before \"HKMA\" unless necessary.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nHKMA hosted a seminar in Frankfurt, Germany, to promote Hong Kong's role in capitalising on the rising China opportunities.\n\n# October\n\n# October 24 to 25\nThe original text is a simple date range, \"10月24日至25日,\" which translates to \"October 24 to 25.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are minor differences in formatting and style.\n- The first junior translator used \"October 24 to 25,\" which is concise and natural in English.\n- The second junior translator included a hashtag and used \"24th to 25th,\" which is slightly more formal and includes ordinal numbers.\n- The third junior translator used an en dash (\"24–25\") and included a hashtag, which is a common format in digital contexts.\n- The fourth, fifth, and sixth junior translators all used \"October 24th to 25th,\" which is also correct but slightly more verbose than necessary.\nThe most natural and concise translation in English would be \"October 24 to 25,\" as it avoids unnecessary ordinal numbers and punctuation while maintaining clarity and fluency. Since there is no dictionary provided that requires specific translations for any terms, the best approach is to use the most natural and widely accepted format.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about a high-level seminar hosted by three institutions in Hong Kong. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, though with some variations in style and punctuation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate and uses the correct terms. However, it lacks the definite article \"the\" before \"International Monetary Fund (IMF)\" and \"Hong Kong,\" which is standard in formal English.\n2. **Translation 2** is concise and uses \"co-hosted\" correctly. It also uses quotation marks around the seminar title, which is appropriate. However, it omits the definite article before \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the original, but it uses \"The HKMA\" and \"The International Monetary Fund,\" which is more formal and appropriate in this context. However, it omits the abbreviation \"IMF\" in parentheses after \"International Monetary Fund.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is similar to Translation 2 but omits the definite article before \"Hong Kong\" and uses \"and\" instead of \"and the\" before \"International Monetary Fund (IMF),\" which is slightly less formal.\n5. **Translation 5** is the most grammatically correct, using \"the\" before all institutions and the title. It also capitalizes \"Prudential Policy\" consistently. However, it uses \"co-hosted\" instead of \"jointly hosted,\" which is slightly less formal.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, using \"the\" before all institutions and the title. It also includes the abbreviation \"IMF\" in parentheses. However, it uses \"co-hosted\" instead of \"jointly hosted,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use the definite article \"the\" before all institutions and locations, as is standard in formal English. It should also use \"jointly hosted\" to reflect the collaborative nature of the event. The title should be in quotation marks and use the exact phrase from the dictionary, with \"Prudential Policy\" capitalized consistently. The abbreviation \"IMF\" should be included in parentheses after the full name.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA, the Bank of England, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) jointly hosted a high-level seminar on \"Monetary, Financial and Prudential Policy Interactions in the post-Crisis World\" in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 26th to 28th\n\nIFFO hosted its first executive workshop titled \"Private Participation in Infrastructure Project Finance in Emerging Markets\" and announced that 13 more institutions have joined as IFFO partners, bringing the total number of partners to over 50.\n\n# October 27th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely serving as a heading or marker. The junior translators have all captured the core content accurately, translating the date correctly as \"October 27\" or \"October 27th.\" However, there are minor differences in formatting and style.\nThe first, second, sixth, fourth, and fifth translators used \"October 27\" without the \"th\" suffix, which is acceptable in many contexts, especially in formal or written English where the ordinal indicator is often omitted. The third translator used \"October 27th,\" which is also correct and may be preferred in more informal or conversational contexts.\nThe use of the \"#\" symbol in the fourth and fifth translations is consistent with the original text, which may indicate that the date is part of a list or a section heading. However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date formatting unless it is part of a specific stylistic or formatting convention.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"October 27th\" as it includes the ordinal indicator, which adds clarity and is often preferred in English for dates when the specific day is emphasized. Additionally, the \"#\" symbol is retained to maintain consistency with the original format.\n\nThe HKMA has expanded the primary liquidity provider (PLP) scheme, increasing the number of participating banks from seven to nine and raising the total quota of the scheme to 18 billion renminbi. The transparency of the HKMA's Renminbi liquidity facility usage has also increased.\n\n# November\n\n# November 4th\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) granting a second batch of stored value facility (SVF) licences under the relevant legislation, increasing the total number of SVF licensees to 13.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** Correctly uses \"pSSVFo\" for \"支付條例\" and \"SVF licensees\" for \"儲值支付工具持牌人.\" However, \"approval\" is slightly less precise than \"issuance\" in this regulatory context. The structure is clear and fluent.\n2. **Translation 2:** Uses \"Payment Regulations\" instead of the correct \"pSSVFo\" from the dictionary. This is a critical error. Also, \"increasing\" is slightly less formal than \"bringing...to.\"\n3. **Translation 3:** Correctly uses \"pSSVFo\" and \"SVF licensees.\" The structure is similar to Translation 1, but \"issuance\" is more precise than \"approval\" in this context.\n4. **Translation 4:** Uses \"Payment Regulations\" instead of \"pSSVFo,\" which is incorrect. Otherwise, the translation is fluent and accurate.\n5. **Translation 5:** Identical to Translation 1, with the same minor issue regarding \"approval\" instead of \"issuance.\"\n6. **Translation 6:** Uses \"Payment Ordinance\" instead of \"pSSVFo,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"has issued\" is slightly less direct than \"issued\" in a formal announcement.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"pSSVFo\" for \"支付條例\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"SVF licensees\" for \"儲值支付工具持牌人.\"\n- Use \"stored value facility (SVF) licences\" for \"儲值支付工具牌照\" to ensure clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"issuance\" instead of \"approval\" for regulatory accuracy.\n- Use \"bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 13\" for a more formal and direct tone.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announced the issuance of the second batch of stored value facility (SVF) licences under the pSSVFo, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 13.\n\n# November 8\n\nIFFO hosted a high-level seminar, during which Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, elaborated on the bank's operations and infrastructure projects.\n\n# November 11th\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Chinese, where the month and day are written in numerals with the character for \"month\" (月) and \"day\" (日) implied. The junior translators have all correctly identified the date as \"November 11th\" or \"November 11,\" with minor variations in formatting.\nThe first, second, and third translations are identical and correct, using the standard English date format with the ordinal \"th\" for the day. The fourth and fifth translations include a \"#\" symbol before the date, which may be an attempt to replicate the original formatting (which includes a \"#\") but is unnecessary in English unless the \"#\" has a specific meaning in context (e.g., a hashtag or section heading). The sixth translation uses \"November 11\" without the \"th,\" which is also grammatically acceptable but less common in formal writing.\nThe best translation would follow the standard English date format, using \"November 11th\" without unnecessary symbols. This format is most natural and widely understood in English-speaking contexts.\n\nHKMA hosted \"Fintech Day\" and released a white paper on distributed ledger technology.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance fluency, grammatical correctness, and naturalness in English.\nFirst, the use of quotation marks and apostrophes around \"Fintech Day\" varies across translations. While all versions are acceptable, using quotation marks consistently (\"Fintech Day\") is preferable for clarity and formality, especially in official or professional contexts.\nSecond, the verb choice between \"hosted,\" \"held,\" and \"published\" or \"released\" affects the tone and formality of the sentence. \"Hosted\" and \"held\" are both appropriate, but \"held\" is more commonly used in formal contexts when referring to events. \"Published\" and \"released\" are both acceptable for the white paper, but \"released\" is more commonly used in modern English for the publication of documents, especially in the context of technology and research.\nThird, the phrase \"the Distributed ledger technology\" should be adjusted to \"distributed ledger technology\" without the article \"the,\" as it is a general term and not referring to a specific instance of the technology.\nConsidering these points, the best possible translation would use \"held\" for the event, \"released\" for the white paper, and omit the article before \"distributed ledger technology\" for grammatical accuracy and natural phrasing. The final translation should also maintain the formal tone appropriate for an official announcement by an institution like the HKMA.\n\nThe original text discusses a collaboration between the HKMA and ASTRI to establish the Fintech Innovation Hub with the purpose of fostering innovative ideas and testing new fintech technologies. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning of the sentence, but there are variations in fluency, vocabulary, and phrasing.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"ASTRI,\" and \"Fintech Innovation Hub.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is generally accurate, with all translations conveying the collaboration and the purpose of the hub.\n- The use of terms like \"foster,\" \"develop,\" \"generate,\" \"conceive,\" and \"test\" all align with the original intent of the sentence.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"aiming to help develop\" or \"to help develop,\" which is slightly less direct than the original's \"以助構思創新意念及試驗嶄新的金融科技技術.\"\n- The use of \"pilot\" in the first translation is slightly off in context, as the original does not imply a trial or pilot program but rather the testing of new technologies.\n- The inclusion of quotation marks around \"Fintech Innovation Hub\" in some translations is unnecessary unless it is a formal title or brand name, which it is not in this context.\n- The phrase \"facilitate the conception of innovative ideas\" in the fourth translation is unnecessarily wordy and less natural than alternatives like \"help conceive innovative ideas.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use more direct and natural phrasing such as \"to help conceive innovative ideas and test new fintech technologies.\"\n- Avoid unnecessary quotation marks unless required.\n- Ensure consistency in verb usage, favoring \"help conceive\" or \"help generate\" over \"develop\" or \"foster\" for better alignment with the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA and the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) jointly established the Fintech Innovation Hub to help conceive innovative ideas and test new fintech technologies.\n\n# November 22\nThe original text is simply a date written in the format commonly used in Traditional Chinese, with the \"#\" symbol likely indicating a heading or section title. The junior translators have all provided translations that are essentially correct, though there are minor differences in formatting.\nThe first, third, and sixth translators used \"November 22\" without any additional formatting, which is a standard and natural way to express the date in English. The second and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which may be appropriate if the original text is part of a larger document with section headings. The fourth translator used \"November 22nd,\" which is also grammatically correct but slightly less common in formal or written English compared to \"November 22.\"\nConsidering the context and the need for a natural, fluent translation, \"November 22\" is the most appropriate and widely accepted format. It is concise, clear, and aligns with standard English date conventions. Including the \"#\" symbol may be useful if the translation is intended to maintain the original formatting, but since the dictionary does not provide any specific instructions regarding symbols, it is safer to omit it unless explicitly required.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is \"November 22.\"\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding the issuance of a consultation paper by several regulatory bodies under a specific ordinance. The junior translators have generally captured the core meaning and structure of the sentence, but there are variations in phrasing and minor inconsistencies in terminology and punctuation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau,\" \"HKMA,\" \"SFC,\" \"Insurance Authority,\" \"consultation paper,\" \"protected arrangements,\" and \"Financial Institutions (Resolution) ordinance.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is largely consistent across translations, with the main subject being the joint issuance of the consultation paper by the listed authorities.\n- The use of \"proposed regulations\" or \"proposed rules\" is appropriate in the context of a consultation paper.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in prepositions and phrasing:** Some translations use \"concerning,\" \"relating to,\" or \"for,\" which are all acceptable but vary slightly in tone and formality. \"Relating to\" and \"concerning\" are more formal and precise, while \"for\" is slightly less precise.\n- **Capitalization of \"Ordinance\":** Some translations use \"Ordinance\" with a capital \"O,\" while others use \"ordinance\" with a lowercase \"o.\" The correct form is \"Ordinance\" when referring to the official name of the legislation.\n- **Use of \"rules\" vs. \"regulations\":** The term \"rules\" appears in one translation, which is less precise than \"regulations\" in the context of legal and regulatory frameworks.\n- **\"Released\" vs. \"issued\":** One translation uses \"released\" instead of \"issued,\" which is less formal and slightly less appropriate in this context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Ordinance\" with a capital \"O\" to reflect the official name of the legislation.\n- Use \"relating to\" or \"concerning\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"regulations\" rather than \"rules\" to maintain consistency with legal terminology.\n- Use \"issued\" rather than \"released\" to match the formal tone of the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, together with the HKMA, SFC, and Insurance Authority, jointly issued a consultation paper on proposed regulations relating to protected arrangements under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\nThe original text is a straightforward news headline, and the junior translators have generally captured the core meaning. However, there are nuances and contextual considerations that can be refined for clarity and accuracy.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association,\" \"Memorandums of Understanding,\" and \"corporate treasury centres.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely correct, and the translations are fluent and grammatically sound.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Chinese enterprises\" vs. \"Chinese-funded enterprises\":** The term \"中資企業\" in the original text refers to enterprises funded by China, not necessarily enterprises based in China or Chinese-owned. Translating it as \"Chinese enterprises\" may be ambiguous, as it could imply companies based in China rather than those funded by Chinese capital. \"Chinese-funded enterprises\" is more precise.\n- **\"Memorandums of Understanding\" vs. \"MOUs\":** While both are acceptable, \"Memorandums of Understanding\" is more formal and appropriate for official documents like this one. \"MOUs\" is more informal and may be less suitable in a formal context.\n- **\"Mainland enterprises\":** This term is not used in the original text and introduces a geographical implication that is not present. The original refers to \"中資企業,\" which is better translated as \"Chinese-funded enterprises.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (singular) as it refers to a single document, not multiple.\n- Use \"Chinese-funded enterprises\" to accurately reflect the meaning of \"中資企業.\"\n- Avoid \"mainland enterprises\" as it is not an equivalent term and may mislead the reader.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nHKMA and the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding to help more Chinese-funded enterprises establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring Organisation Logo"],"2016年存款保障計劃（修訂）條例":["Deposit

Facing increased uncertainty in the external environment, it is expected that economic growth will remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weak inbound tourism putting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand momentum also slowed, but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying at a low level of 3.3 to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation further eased due to the subsiding of local cost and external price pressures. Facing a volatile external environment and changing market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. In response to the renewed strength in the residential property market, the government introduced new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite fluctuations in the external environment and rising US interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate, which weakened slightly in January, has remained around the 7.75 level. The convertibility undertaking was not triggered during the year, and the Aggregate Balance, combined with outstanding Exchange Fund paper, remained almost unchanged at approximately HK$1.2 trillion. Following the US interest rate hike in mid-December, the HKMA's basic interest rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but slightly increased towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the corresponding trends in US interbank rates and yields. Total loans growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although the overall quality of loans slightly deteriorated, the classified loan ratio remained at an extremely low level.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth. Source: Government Statistics Department.\nThe original text is a straightforward title and source citation. The junior translators have mostly captured the meaning accurately, though there are minor differences in phrasing and terminology.\nTranslation 1 is clear and concise, using \"real local GDP\" and \"Government Statistics Department,\" which aligns well with the original.\nTranslation 2 uses \"Real Gross Domestic Product\" instead of \"real local GDP,\" which is slightly less precise, as the original specifies \"本地\" (local), which is important in economic contexts.\nTranslation 3 uses \"Census and Statistics Department,\" which may not be the exact name of the department in the original context, and \"Gross Domestic Product\" again omits the \"local\" qualifier.\nTranslation 4 is problematic due to the mix of English and Chinese characters (\"生产总值\") and an awkward structure.\nTranslation 5 is very similar to Translation 1 and is accurate and concise.\nTranslation 6 uses \"Breakdown of Contributions\" instead of \"Contribution of Components,\" which is slightly different in emphasis but still acceptable.\nThe best translation would be a concise and accurate rendering that preserves the original terminology, including \"real local GDP\" and the correct department name. Based on the above, the most accurate and natural translation is:\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change in the total amount of local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nData source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Local Demand\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly convey the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the slight weakening of local demand growth in 2016, the slowdown in private and government consumption, the fluctuation in fixed capital formation, and the contrasting trends in machinery purchases and construction activity.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the structure and key data points of the original text.\n- The use of terms like \"private consumption,\" \"government consumption,\" \"fixed capital formation,\" and \"housing starts\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The translations are fluent and natural in English, with minimal grammatical errors.\n- The use of terms like \"contracting,\" \"fluctuate significantly,\" and \"turn positive\" effectively captures the economic nuances of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"growth momentum\" versus \"pace of growth,\" which are both acceptable but not identical.\n- The phrase \"seasonal fluctuations\" in one translation may be misleading, as the original text refers to quarterly fluctuations, not necessarily seasonal ones.\n- The term \"housing commencement projects\" in one translation is slightly awkward compared to \"housing starts\" or \"housing projects commenced.\"\n- The use of \"business outlooks\" (plural) in one translation is slightly less idiomatic than \"business outlook\" (singular).\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"growth momentum\" or \"pace of growth.\"\n- Clarify that the fluctuations are quarterly, not seasonal.\n- Use more idiomatic expressions such as \"housing starts\" rather than \"housing commencement projects.\"\n- Maintain singular \"business outlook\" for consistency with economic terminology.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe growth momentum of local demand slightly weakened in 2016. Although stable employment and income conditions continued to support private consumption, its growth rate fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting heightened economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slightly slowed to 3.3%. Total local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), resulting in a cumulative contraction of 0.5% for the year. Private sector purchases of machinery and equipment became the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid poor business outlook, while building and construction activities turned more positive due to increased housing starts.\n\nFigure 2: Local Demand. Source: Government Statistics Department.\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, containing two main elements: a figure caption (\"圖 2 本地需求\") and a source citation (\"資料來源：政府統計處。\"). The junior translators have generally captured the meaning accurately, but there are variations in punctuation, capitalization, and the name of the department.\nStrengths of the translations include the correct identification of \"圖 2\" as \"Figure 2\" and \"本地需求\" as \"Local Demand.\" The term \"資料來源\" is consistently translated as \"Source\" or \"Data Source,\" which is appropriate. However, the department name \"政府統計處\" is translated inconsistently: some use \"Government Statistics Department,\" others use \"Census and Statistics Department,\" and one uses \"Hong Kong Statistics Office.\" This is a critical issue, as the department's name must be accurate.\n\"政府統計處\" is the official name of the department in Hong Kong, and the correct English translation is \"Census and Statistics Department.\" Therefore, translations that use \"Government Statistics Department\" or \"Hong Kong Statistics Office\" are inaccurate.\nIn terms of punctuation and formatting, the use of a colon after \"Figure 2\" and the placement of the source citation are matters of style. While all translations are grammatically correct, the most fluent and standard format is to use a colon after \"Figure 2\" and to capitalize \"Source\" as a noun in the citation.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be:\n**Figure 2: Local Demand. Source: Census and Statistics Department.**\n\n# External Requirements\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilization near the end of 2016, but the overall annual performance remained weak (Figure 3). Goods exports increased by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Hong Kong's exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, with regional trade flows becoming more stable, exports to Mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales after a period of rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had contracted in 2015, partially recovered in 2016, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from increased travel intentions among local residents. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3: Goods Exports and Services Exports. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained under control in 2016. Excluding the ramifications of one-time government relief measures, the core inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The inflation of the rental component in the Composite Consumer Price Index declined due to the pass-through effects from the earlier reduction in private residential rents. Benefiting from softer global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, import price inflation was contained. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate, supported by stable growth in labor costs and eased rental cost pressures, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nFigure 4: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, consisting of a title and a source citation. The key elements to translate are \"基本消費物價通脹\" and \"資料來源：政府統計處。\" Since the dictionary is empty, there are no specific term mappings to follow, so the focus is on ensuring accurate and natural English translation.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - \"Figure 4 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" is grammatically correct but lacks a colon after \"Figure 4,\" which is standard in formal English for such titles.  \n   - \"Data source: Census and Statistics Department\" is correct, though \"Census and Statistics Department\" is the official name in Hong Kong, so it is appropriate.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - This version is nearly identical to the first, but includes a colon after \"Figure 4,\" which improves clarity and formality.  \n   - The source is the same, and the translation is accurate.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - The colon after \"Figure 4\" is correctly used.  \n   - However, \"Government Statistics Department\" is not the official name in Hong Kong; the correct term is \"Census and Statistics Department.\" This is a minor but important inaccuracy.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Core Consumption Inflation\" is a slightly different phrasing from \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation.\" While \"core\" and \"basic\" can be similar in meaning, \"core\" is more commonly used in economic contexts to refer to inflation excluding volatile items. However, the original uses \"基本\" (basic), which may imply a different nuance.  \n   - The source is translated as \"Government Statistics Department,\" which is not the official name in Hong Kong.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - This version uses \"Core Consumer Price Inflation,\" which is similar to the fourth translation. Again, \"core\" may not be the best match for \"基本.\"  \n   - The source is correctly translated as \"Census and Statistics Department.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" is accurate.  \n   - However, \"Government Statistics Office\" is not the correct name in Hong Kong; the correct term is \"Census and Statistics Department.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the standard title format with a colon after \"Figure 4,\" use the correct official name of the department in Hong Kong (\"Census and Statistics Department\"), and accurately reflect the original term \"基本消費物價通脹\" as \"Basic Consumer Price Inflation\" rather than \"Core Consumer Price Inflation,\" which may imply a different economic concept.\nThus, the most accurate and natural translation is:\n**Figure 4: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.**\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly convey the core meaning of the original text, which discusses the stability of the labor market in 2016, the deterioration in tourism-related industries, and the changes in unemployment rates and wage growth compared to 2015.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations use appropriate terminology related to labor economics, such as \"seasonally adjusted unemployment rate,\" \"nominal wages,\" and \"real wages.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the logical flow of the information.\n- The use of \"Figure 5\" is correctly placed in parentheses, as in the original.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different prepositions or phrasing, such as \"by industry\" versus \"when analyzed by industry,\" which may affect the nuance slightly.\n- The phrase \"under the stable labor market\" is used in some translations, which is slightly awkward compared to \"with a stable labor market\" or \"given the stable labor market.\"\n- The phrase \"remained largely stable\" is repeated in all translations, which is acceptable but could be varied slightly for stylistic diversity.\n**Improvements:**\n- To enhance fluency and variety, the phrase \"remained largely stable\" could be replaced with \"remained relatively stable\" or \"showed little change.\"\n- The phrase \"under the stable labor market\" could be rephrased to \"given the stable labor market\" or \"with a stable labor market\" for better readability.\n- The use of \"rose slightly\" is consistent, but \"increased slightly\" could be used for variation.\n- The phrase \"compared to an increase of\" is repeated in several translations; \"compared to a rise of\" or \"compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015\" could be used for variation.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would maintain the accuracy of the original while improving fluency and stylistic variety.\nThe labor market remained relatively stable in 2016, with roughly equal increases in labor supply and demand. When analyzed by industry, labor market conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while other industries remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). Given the stable labor market, nominal wages rose by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\nThe original text is concise and straightforward, containing two main components: a title (\"圖 5 勞工市場狀況\") and a source citation (\"資料來源：政府統計處。\"). The goal is to translate these accurately and fluently into English.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and fluent. The use of \"Source\" is appropriate and matches the original \"資料來源.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 5 Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Office.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The title is clear.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Statistics Office\" is slightly less precise than \"Statistics Department\" in the context of a government agency. Also, the lack of a colon after \"Figure 5\" is slightly less formal.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 5: Labor Market Situation. Source of data: Census and Statistics Department.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"Source of data\" is slightly more descriptive.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Census and Statistics Department\" is not accurate for \"政府統計處\" (Government Statistics Department). Also, \"Situation\" is less precise than \"Conditions\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 5 Labor Market Conditions. Data Source: Statistics Department.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** The use of \"Data Source\" is appropriate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Statistics Department\" is less specific than \"Government Statistics Department,\" which better reflects the original term.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 5 Labor Market Conditions. Data source: Government Statistics Department.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and fluent.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The lack of a colon after \"Figure 5\" is slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses the correct term \"Government Statistics Department\" and maintains a formal structure with the colon after \"Figure 5\" and the use of \"Data Source.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be formal, accurate, and consistent with the original text. It should use the correct term \"Government Statistics Department\" and maintain a standard format for figures and sources. The use of \"Data Source\" is slightly more precise than \"Source\" in this context, and the inclusion of a colon after \"Figure 5\" adds to the formality and clarity.\n**Final Translation:**\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Data Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# stock market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"US Federal Reserve,\" \"renminbi,\" and \"Brexit referendum.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key financial data (e.g., percentage changes, figures) are accurately translated.\n- Most translations maintain a formal and professional tone appropriate for financial reporting.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"the ramifications of the renminbi depreciation\" (Translation 4), which is less natural than \"pressure from the renminbi's depreciation.\"\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use \"local stock market\" (Translation 5) instead of \"Hong Kong's stock market,\" which is less precise and less consistent with the original text.\n- **Numerical Formatting:** Some translations use inconsistent formatting for large numbers (e.g., \"11,156 billion HK dollars\" vs. \"HK$111.56 billion\"), which can confuse readers.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the Hong Kong stock market\" multiple times in close proximity, which can reduce readability.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use consistent and natural phrasing, such as \"pressure from the renminbi's depreciation\" instead of \"ramifications of the renminbi depreciation.\"\n- Maintain the phrase \"Hong Kong's stock market\" for consistency and clarity.\n- Ensure numerical formatting is consistent (e.g., \"HK$105.6 billion\" instead of \"105.6 billion HK dollars\").\n- Avoid redundancy by varying sentence structure and using synonyms where appropriate.\nBased on this review, here is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant fluctuations in 2016, affected by pressure from the renminbi's depreciation and volatility in the Mainland stock market. The Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). Hong Kong's stock market rebounded in March, following significant gains in the US and other major stock markets. Although the Brexit referendum triggered market volatility, market sentiment quickly improved amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, the Hong Kong stock market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter, influenced by the results of the US presidential election and expectations that the US would accelerate interest rate hikes. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover decreased from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, while the total fundraising amount from Hong Kong's stock market also dropped from HK$1,115.6 billion to HK$490.1 billion.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\nThe original text is a simple heading: \"# 物業市場\". The term \"物業市場\" translates directly to \"property market\" or \"real estate market\" in English. The junior translators have provided several variations, including \"Property market\" (with lowercase \"market\"), \"#PropertyMarket\" (without a space), \"# Property Market\" (with a space), and \"# Real Estate Market\" (using \"real estate\" instead of \"property\").\nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Correct identification of the core term \"物業市場\" as \"property market\" or \"real estate market.\"\n- Use of the hashtag symbol (#) in some translations, which is appropriate for headings or tags in digital contexts.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Inconsistency in capitalization and spacing (e.g., \"Property market\" vs. \"Property Market\").\n- Some translations use \"Real Estate Market\" instead of \"Property Market,\" which is a valid alternative but less commonly used in this context.\n- The use of hashtags without spaces (e.g., \"#PropertyMarket\") may be less readable or appropriate depending on the context.\nImprovements could include:\n- Choosing a consistent format, such as \"# Property Market\" or \"#PropertyMarket,\" depending on the intended use (e.g., social media vs. formal document).\n- Ensuring that the term \"物業市場\" is translated consistently as \"Property Market\" or \"Real Estate Market\" based on context and preference.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be \"# Property Market,\" as it maintains consistency in capitalization and spacing, and is commonly used in both formal and informal contexts.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"residential property market,\" \"housing affordability,\" and \"Hong Kong interbank offered Rates\" (or \"HIBORs\"). However, there are minor differences in phrasing and structure that affect fluency and clarity.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms.\n- Clear and coherent structure of the information.\n- Proper use of financial and real estate terminology.\n- Consistent handling of numerical data and references to figures.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Some translations use \"Hong Kong interbank offered Rates\" without the abbreviation \"HIBORs,\" which is less common in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"income leverage ratio\" is used in all translations, but it is not a standard term in real estate or finance. The more common term is \"debt-to-income ratio,\" though the original text uses \"收入槓桿比率,\" which is more accurately translated as \"income leverage ratio\" in this context.\n- Some translations use \"units\" after \"54,701,\" which is unnecessary and slightly awkward.\n- The phrase \"slightly rebounded\" or \"slightly decreased\" is used repeatedly, which can be monotonous. Varying the verb choice can improve readability.\n- The placement of the footnote \"2\" in one translation is awkward and should be omitted unless it is part of the original text.\nImprovements could include:\n- Using \"HIBORs\" consistently when referring to \"香港銀行同業拆息.\"\n- Ensuring that the term \"income leverage ratio\" is used consistently and clearly.\n- Avoiding the use of \"units\" after numerical values unless necessary.\n- Varying the verb usage to enhance readability and fluency.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of all versions while addressing the noted weaknesses for clarity, fluency, and consistency.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. Property transaction volumes hit a historical low in the first quarter but rebounded in the following months. However, they declined again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volumes slightly decreased to 54,701 in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose from the second quarter onwards, surpassing the high recorded in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% for the year (Figure 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with a price-to-income ratio of 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, significantly higher than the long-term average. Due to competitive mortgage plans introduced by banks, mortgage rates slightly declined, but rose slightly towards the end of the year in line with the increase in HIBORs. In the commercial property market, trading remained largely stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices fell from their 2015 highs, corresponding rental yields rose slightly compared to the previous year, but remained at low levels.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"基建項目\" as \"infrastructure projects.\"\n- The term \"影響\" is translated as \"ramifications\" in Translation 1 and 3, which is appropriate in the context of \"will have ramifications for business capital investment.\"\n- \"香港\" is consistently translated as \"Hong Kong\" in all translations, which is correct.\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are well preserved in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Translation 1 uses \"suppress\" for \"抑制,\" which is accurate, but \"ramifications\" is used correctly in context.\n- Translation 2 uses \"restrain\" for \"抑制,\" which is also acceptable, but \"suppress\" is more direct.\n- Translation 3 uses \"will have ramifications on business capital investment,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"will have ramifications for business capital investment.\"\n- Translation 4 uses \"appreciation\" for \"上升,\" which is slightly off; \"rise\" or \"increase\" would be more precise.\n- Translation 5 is very close to the best version, with only minor issues in word choice.\n- Translation 6 uses \"impact business capital investment and its ramifications,\" which is redundant and less concise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best version should use \"suppress\" for \"抑制\" as it is more direct and commonly used in economic contexts.\n- \"Ramifications\" should be used with \"for\" rather than \"on\" for grammatical correctness.\n- \"Rise\" or \"increase\" is more precise than \"appreciation\" when referring to the exchange rate.\n- The phrase \"will have ramifications for business capital investment\" is the most natural and concise.\n- The term \"infrastructure projects\" should be used consistently.\n- The structure should be clear and maintain the logical flow of the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nReal GDP growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017. The government forecasts economic growth to be between 2 and 3 percent, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0 percent. Externally, as the global macroeconomic and financial environment becomes increasingly uncertain, global economic and trade growth may remain moderate; in addition, the rise in the Hong Kong dollar's real effective exchange rate due to the strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to suppress Hong Kong's export performance. Locally, although stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow moderately, weighed down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of multiple infrastructure projects, building and construction activities should grow steadily. However, weak business sentiment and rising interest rates will have ramifications for business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation in Mainland China may push up import prices, while on the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may help to suppress these pressures. With moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures are expected to remain under control. However, due to the rise in new residential rental prices at the beginning of 2017, inflation in the rental component of the Composite Consumer Price Index may rise slightly. The market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although increased uncertainties may have ramifications on hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertain Factors and Risks\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of vocabulary choice, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"US interest rate normalisation,\" \"capital flows,\" \"Brexit,\" \"asset markets,\" and \"ramifications.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are well preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and natural in English, with minimal awkward phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in vocabulary:** Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"make the global economic outlook more uncertain\" vs. \"make the global economic outlook more ambiguous.\" While both are acceptable, \"uncertain\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Grammar and clarity:** A few translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the holding of major elections\" (Translation 6) or \"the possibility of the US accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes\" (Translation 5), which can be simplified for clarity.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Some translations use \"Hong Kong dollar\" (Translation 2) instead of \"capital flows into Hong Kong,\" which is less precise than the dictionary term \"capital flows.\"\n- **Nuance and flow:** Some translations use \"pose resistance\" or \"create resistance,\" which is acceptable, but \"pose obstacles\" or \"pose challenges\" may be more natural in certain contexts.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"uncertain\" rather than \"ambiguous\" to better reflect the original meaning.\n- Use \"capital flows into Hong Kong\" rather than \"capital flows into the Hong Kong dollar\" for clarity and consistency with the dictionary.\n- Simplify phrasing such as \"the possibility of the US accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes\" to \"the possibility of the US accelerating interest rate hikes.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"US\" vs. \"U.S.\" (the dictionary uses \"US,\" so it should be followed).\n- Maintain a natural flow and avoid overly complex phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be constrained by numerous uncertainties, with the ramifications from the external environment being particularly significant. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new US administration will make the global economic outlook more uncertain, and potential protectionist policies may also pose resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and general elections in several major European countries may also lead to volatility in asset markets and affect capital flows into Hong Kong. In addition, US interest rate normalisation will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains tight, and the market outlook remains very uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and property developers offering additional incentives (such as discounts and cash rebates) that release accumulated purchasing power can all support residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the possibility of the US accelerating interest rate hikes, and steady growth in housing supply may continue to pose resistance to the property market.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite headwinds facing the domestic economy and unexpected outcomes of international political events exacerbating market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. Authorized institutions maintained strong capital and liquidity positions, with asset quality slightly deteriorating but still remaining at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nAs U.S. interest rates rose, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) significantly increased in November and December. The composite interest rate, reflecting retail banks' Hong Kong dollar funding costs, rose slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates, Composite Interest Rates, and Prime Lending Rates\n\nNotes:\n1. The Hong Kong interbank offered rates (monthly average) are published by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. The prime lending rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profitability Trends  \nProfit trend  \nProfit trend  \n# Profit Trend  \nProfit Trend  \n# Profit Trend  \nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in formatting and fluency. The term \"盈利走勢\" is best translated as \"Profitability Trends\" or \"Profit Trend,\" depending on the context. \"Profitability Trends\" is more comprehensive and formal, while \"Profit Trend\" is more concise. Since the original text includes a hashtag (#), it is appropriate to retain this in the translation. However, the use of a hashtag in the English translation may not be necessary unless it is part of a specific branding or formatting requirement.\nConsidering the context and the need for a natural and fluent translation, \"Profitability Trends\" is the most appropriate choice. It accurately conveys the meaning of \"盈利走勢\" and is more suitable for formal or professional contexts.\nProfitability Trends\n\nRetail banking profitability slightly improved in 2016, with the overall pre-tax operating profit of its Hong Kong business increasing by 8.7%. The growth was primarily driven by income from foreign exchange and derivative overlay portfolios (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). After-tax profit for retail banking rose by 44.4%, primarily due to non-recurring items. The after-tax return on average assets for retail banking also increased from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Performance of Retail Banking\nThe original text is a simple title: \"圖8 零售銀行的表現,\" which translates to \"Figure 8: Performance of Retail Banking.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this title, and while all are grammatically correct, there are subtle differences in style and clarity.\nTranslation 1: \"Figure 8 Performance of Retail Banking\" is concise but lacks a colon, which is commonly used in figure titles to separate the label from the description.\nTranslation 2: \"Figure 8: Performance of Retail Banks\" uses \"Banks\" (plural), which may not be the best fit if the context refers to the industry or sector as a whole rather than individual banks.\nTranslation 3: \"Figure 8 Retail Bank Performance\" is more concise but less formal and may be less appropriate for a professional or academic context.\nTranslation 4 and 5: \"Figure 8: Performance of Retail Banking\" are identical and correctly use the colon and the singular \"Banking,\" which refers to the sector or industry, not individual banks.\nTranslation 6: \"Figure 8: Retail Banking's Performance\" is grammatically correct but slightly more possessive in tone, which may not be the most standard way to phrase such a title.\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate translation would be \"Figure 8: Performance of Retail Banking,\" as it is clear, professional, and accurately reflects the original Chinese title. It uses the correct grammatical structure and maintains the singular form \"Banking,\" which is appropriate when referring to the industry as a whole.\n\nIn 2016, the net interest margin for retail banking was 1.32%, the same as in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate surplus funds to financial investments with lower interest rates and higher liquidity, the decrease in interest income was offset by a decline in interest expense.\n\nFigure 9: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\nThe original text is a simple title: \"圖9 零售銀行淨息差\". The term \"淨息差\" is commonly translated as \"Net Interest Margin\" or \"Net Interest Spread\" in financial contexts. \"零售銀行\" refers to \"Retail Banking\" or \"Retail Banks\", depending on whether it is referring to the sector as a whole or individual institutions.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in phrasing and structure. The most common and natural phrasing in English would be \"Figure 9: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\", which is used by the first, second, fifth, and sixth translators. This version is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the standard financial terminology.\nThe third translator used \"Retail Banks\" instead of \"Retail Banking\", which is slightly less common in this context, as the term \"Retail Banking\" refers to the sector or activity, not individual banks. The fourth translator used \"Net Interest Spread\" instead of \"Net Interest Margin\", which is a slightly different term, though both are used in finance. However, \"Net Interest Margin\" is more commonly used in the context of banking performance.\nBased on these observations, the best translation would be \"Figure 9: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking\", as it is the most natural and commonly used phrasing in financial contexts.\n\nRetail bank non-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fees and commission income decreased by 11.3%, dividend income and income from foreign exchange and derivative overlay portfolios increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

in 2016. The Hong Kong money market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System continued to demonstrate a high capacity to withstand shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of terminology from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Currency Board arrangements,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"US dollar reserves,\" and \"monetary base.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"currency stability\" or \"Monetary Stability\" is appropriate, though \"currency stability\" is more commonly used in economic contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"that is, to ensure the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong is stable,\" which is grammatically correct but less fluent than alternatives like \"which means ensuring the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong remains stable.\"\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar\" and \"in the foreign exchange markets,\" which can be streamlined.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"Monetary Base\" with a capital \"M\" while others use \"monetary base\" with a lowercase \"m.\" The dictionary lists \"Monetary Base\" as an option, but consistency in capitalization is important for clarity and professionalism.\n- **Clarity of Proportional Relationships:** The phrase \"matching the change in the Monetary Base by 100 percent\" is slightly awkward. A more natural phrasing would be \"fully matching the changes in the Monetary Base.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms consistently.\n- It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing while maintaining the precise meaning of the original text.\n- The use of \"currency stability\" is preferable to \"Monetary Stability\" in this context, as it is more commonly used in economic literature.\n- The phrase \"fully matching the changes in the Monetary Base\" is more natural than \"matching the change... by 100 percent.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which means ensuring the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong remains stable, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange markets. This monetary system primarily adopts Currency Board arrangements, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% support for the Monetary Base; if the Monetary Base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the Monetary Base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued notes and coins  \n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts held by banks with the HKMA (i.e., Aggregate Balance)  \n- Exchange Fund paper issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\nAll junior translators have correctly translated the term \"貨幣基礎\" as \"Monetary Base,\" which is the exact term provided in the dictionary. The translations are consistent and accurate in this regard. The phrase \"Table 1\" is also correctly used to denote the table's numbering.\nThe translations are minimal in scope, as the original text is very short, consisting only of the title of a table. Given the brevity of the original text, there is not much room for variation or elaboration. However, in a more complex context, one might consider whether additional context or explanation is needed, but in this case, the translations are sufficient.\nSince the original text is simply the title of a table, the best possible translation is to maintain the structure and terminology exactly as provided. No improvements are necessary in this case, as the translations are already accurate and fluent.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and the use of terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, with proper use of the dictionary terms. However, the phrase \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85\" is slightly awkward. It would be more natural to say \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"convertibility undertaking\" without the word \"the\" before it, which is acceptable but slightly less formal. The phrase \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back down from the strong-side CU level\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"the Hong Kong dollar is oversupplied\" which is slightly less natural than \"there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar.\" The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A\" is inconsistent with the dictionary, which lists it as \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first and third, with a slightly more natural flow. It uses \"causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall\" which is more natural than \"lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\" The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will return from the weak-side CU level\" which is slightly more natural than \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the weak-side CU level.\" The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"7.75 HKD\/USD\" which is a more concise and natural way to express the exchange rate. The use of \"purchase\" instead of \"buy\" is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to within the Convertibility Zone\" can be simplified to \"bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the Convertibility Zone.\"\n- The use of \"Aggregate Balance\" with a capital \"A\" is consistent with the dictionary and should be maintained.\n- The phrase \"7.75 HKD\/USD\" is more concise and natural than \"7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar.\"\n- The use of \"convertibility undertaking\" without \"the\" is acceptable but slightly less formal.\n- The phrase \"there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar\" is more natural than \"the Hong Kong dollar is oversupplied.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the Convertibility undertaking. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side CU of 7.75 HKD\/USD, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the Aggregate Balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side CU of 7.85 HKD\/USD, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing the Aggregate Balance and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly incorporate the dictionary terms, though some variations exist in the capitalization of \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" and the use of \"ramifications\" for \"影響.\" The translations are consistent in conveying the core message of the original text, which is the behavior of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in 2016, influenced by both the Linked Exchange Rate System and various market factors.\nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the dictionary terms, particularly \"stock market,\" \"Linked Exchange Rate System,\" \"renminbi,\" \"Mainland,\" \"foreign exchange markets,\" \"Brexit referendum,\" \"US presidential election,\" and \"ramifications.\"\n- Clear and fluent English, with minimal grammatical errors.\n- Consistent use of financial terminology and appropriate phrasing for economic contexts.\nWeaknesses include:\n- Minor inconsistencies in the capitalization of \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" (some use \"Linked\" with a capital L, others use \"linked\").\n- The use of \"ramifications\" for \"影響\" in one translation is less idiomatic than \"impact\" or \"effects.\"\n- Some translations use \"fluctuated slightly\" or \"experienced minor fluctuations,\" which are all acceptable, but \"experienced slight fluctuations\" is more concise and natural.\n- The phrase \"remained within a narrow range\" is repeated across translations, which is acceptable but could be varied slightly for stylistic diversity.\nImprovements could include:\n- Ensuring consistent capitalization of \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- Using more idiomatic expressions for \"影響\" such as \"impact\" or \"effects\" instead of \"ramifications.\"\n- Varying sentence structures slightly to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural phrasing, consistent terminology, and idiomatic expressions while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced slight fluctuations in the first two months of 2016 before remaining within a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar significantly weakened against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was in line with the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve's December 2015 interest rate hike. In addition, other market-related factors, including the sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic outlooks for both the Mainland and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the renminbi exchange rate, and the general weakness of Asian currencies, all contributed to a decline in demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened in February and remained within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards, unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced a brief period of weakening pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange markets operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates\nThe original text is a simple title, \"圖 1 2016年市場匯率,\" which translates to \"Figure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, with the primary differences being the use of a colon (\":\") and the pluralization of \"Rates.\"\nThe first, fourth, and sixth translations omit the colon, while the second, third, and fifth include it. The third and fourth translations use the singular \"Rate,\" while the others use the plural \"Rates.\"\nIn terms of grammar and fluency, the use of a colon is more common in English for titles that include a subtitle or explanation, so \"Figure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates\" is the most natural and standard format. Additionally, \"Exchange Rates\" is the correct plural form when referring to the rates of multiple currencies, which is likely the context here.\nTherefore, the best translation is \"Figure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates.\"\n\nSince the Convertibility undertaking was not triggered, the Aggregate Balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund paper remained largely unchanged at around HKD 12,222 billion in 2016 (Figure 2). Throughout the year, the HKMA issued Exchange Fund paper worth HKD 1,320 billion to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, which correspondingly reduced the Aggregate Balance to HKD 2,596 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of Exchange Fund paper was in line with Currency Board arrangements, as the issuance represented a transfer within the components of the monetary base, that is, from the Aggregate Balance to outstanding Exchange Fund paper, with the monetary base still fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Exchange Fund Paper in 2016\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong interbank offered rates remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). During January and February, HIBORs faced some upward pressure due to increased financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as the financial environment calmed down. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the Brexit referendum results and U.S. money market fund reforms, HIBORs remained largely stable. Partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong dollar rates with the rise in U.S. rates, HIBORs recorded a significant increase in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, short-term interbank rates remained largely below the benchmark rate in 2016.\n\nIn response to the US Federal Funds Rate target range being raised from 0.25 to 0.50 percent to 0.50 to 0.75 percent on December 14 (US time), the basic interest rate was raised from 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent on December 15. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. Under this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of either the lower bound of the US Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average level of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 2016 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\nHong Kong dollar forward points experienced a significant premium in January, largely following the trend of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, as well as partly reflecting investors' demand for currency hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). The forward rate premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, Hong Kong dollar forward points remained largely stable from March to November, after which they rose again in December due to the narrowing of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount Window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HKD 5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the linked exchange Rate System (LERS) has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. In early 2016, increased market volatility once again sparked comments about the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and situations reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis period. To enhance public understanding of the LERS, the HKMA explained the technical details of the system to the public and pointed out that Hong Kong's financial system is capable of withstanding shocks. The government also reiterated its firm commitment to maintaining the LERS. Stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforced public confidence in the government's resolve to maintain the LERS and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and store of value. During its annual Article IV Consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund clearly stated that the LERS is the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, highlighting Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample financial and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation as the underpinning of the LERS.\n\nFigure 4: 2016 USD\/HKD Forward Points\n\nGiven the original text and the translations provided, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths Across Translations:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"linked exchange rate system,\" \"banking system,\" \"Mainland,\" and \"stress-test.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n- **\"linked exchange Rate System\"** – Inconsistently capitalized. The correct form should be \"linked exchange rate system\" (no capitalization unless it's a proper noun, which it is not in this context).\n- **\"Hong Kong interbank offered Rates\"** – Inconsistently capitalized. The correct form is \"Hong Kong interbank offered rates\" or \"HIBORs\" (as per the dictionary).\n- **\"citizens\" vs. \"public\"** – The sixth translation uses \"citizens,\" which is less common in formal policy statements than \"public.\"\n- **\"strengthen the regulation\" vs. \"strengthen regulation\"** – The sixth translation uses \"strengthen the regulation,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"strengthen regulation.\"\n- **\"remained alert\" vs. \"remain vigilant\"** – \"Remain vigilant\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- **\"market fluctuations\" vs. \"market volatility\"** – Both are acceptable, but \"market volatility\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent capitalization for terms like \"linked exchange rate system\" and \"Hong Kong interbank offered rates.\"\n- Use \"public\" rather than \"citizens\" for consistency with formal policy language.\n- Use \"remain vigilant\" for formality and clarity.\n- Use \"market volatility\" for financial accuracy.\n- Ensure that the structure is clear and the flow is natural.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would integrate the strengths of all versions while addressing the noted inconsistencies and stylistic choices.\n---\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress-test results, and strengthens regulation of banks' personal, corporate, and Mainland-related loans to ensure the banking system's ability to withstand shocks. In the face of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) have begun to rise, and the HKMA reminds the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated as backing assets for the monetary base. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 106.7% as of December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the backing portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources provide a strong buffer for Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5 Daily Fluctuations in the Backing Ratio for 2016\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2016, topics discussed by the Currency Board Sub-Committee included the synchronization of Hong Kong's economic growth with that of Mainland China and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and Hong Kong's financial conditions indexes. Meeting minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee and the HKMA's reports on the operation of the Currency Board arrangements submitted to it are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research\" and \"research center\" consistently. It is fluent and accurate, though \"research center\" is slightly redundant since the full name already includes \"Institute for Monetary Research.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very similar to Translation 1 but uses \"the institute\" instead of \"the research center,\" which is more concise and avoids redundancy. It also uses \"for visits\" instead of \"to visit,\" which is slightly more natural in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** uses the abbreviation \"HKIMR\" and \"the center,\" which is acceptable but less formal than using the full name. It is concise and fluent.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"the financial sector\" instead of \"finance,\" which is more specific but slightly less natural in this context. It also uses \"the research center,\" which is redundant.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"the banking sector\" and \"the research center jointly invited,\" which is slightly awkward. \"Jointly invited\" is not supported by the original text, which simply states \"合共邀請\" (invited a total of).\n6. **Translation 6** uses \"financial sectors\" (plural), which is incorrect since the original refers to \"金融範疇\" (financial field or sector, singular). It also uses \"research center\" again, which is redundant.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The full name \"Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research\" should be used for clarity and formality, as it is the official name.\n- \"Research center\" should be avoided in favor of \"the institute\" to prevent redundancy.\n- \"Finance\" is more natural than \"financial sector\" in this context.\n- \"Invited a total of 18 scholars to visit\" is more natural than \"for visits.\"\n- \"Work\" should be included in \"research work\" to match the original Chinese term \"研究工作.\"\n- The term \"financial sectors\" should be singular: \"financial sector.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research continues to support research work in monetary policy, banking, and finance. In 2016, the institute invited a total of 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nThe six junior translations are generally accurate and fluent, with minor variations in style and terminology. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, though some variations exist in phrasing and structure. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"the event attracted senior officials...\" is slightly wordy, but otherwise, the translation is clear and natural. The term \"carry trade activity and information flows\" is slightly awkward compared to \"carry trade and information flows.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies\" which is slightly more natural than \"the renminbi's impact on the global and regional economies.\" The phrase \"the impact on and outlook for Asia's potential growth\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is slightly more concise and uses \"the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional levels\" which is not as natural as \"the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies.\" The phrase \"resilience of the regional economic system\" is slightly more formal than \"resilience of regional economies.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation uses \"ramifications\" for \"影響\" in the theme of the first conference, which is a valid dictionary choice but less common in this context. The phrase \"the impact of renminbi on the global and regional economies\" is slightly awkward. The use of \"carry trade\" is correct, but \"carry trade activity\" is redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the second, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"dynamic changes in Hong Kong's housing prices\" which is slightly more natural than \"dynamics in Hong Kong housing prices.\" The phrase \"the impact on and outlook for Asia's potential growth\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and natural. It uses \"the ramifications of the renminbi on the global and regional economies\" which is slightly more formal than \"the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies.\" The phrase \"the spill-overs of the Mainland economy’s slowdown on other parts of the region\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"impact\" rather than \"ramifications\" for \"影響\" in the theme of the first conference, as it is more natural in this context.\n- Use \"the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies\" rather than \"the ramifications of the renminbi on the global and regional economies.\"\n- Use \"resilience of regional economies\" rather than \"resilience of the regional economic system.\"\n- Use \"the impact on and outlook for Asia's potential growth\" rather than \"the impact and prospects for Asia’s potential growth.\"\n- Use \"dynamics in Hong Kong housing prices\" rather than \"dynamic changes in Hong Kong's housing prices.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most natural and accurate phrasing from the junior translations, with minor adjustments for fluency and clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThis year, the research center hosted six international conferences and seminars, mainly including:\n- In January, the \"Seventh Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy\" was held, with the theme \"China's Deepening Impact on the Global Economy.\" During the event, eight research papers were presented, covering a wide range of topics, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spill-overs from China, the impact of the renminbi on the global and regional economies, and trends in carry trade and information flows between renminbi markets.\n- In March, the \"HKUST-Keio-HKIMR Conference on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was co-hosted with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University. The conference covered multiple economic topics, including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, the \"Real Estate and Financial Stability Conference\" was co-hosted with the City University of Hong Kong. The papers presented covered topics such as age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics in Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle housing decisions; and the residential property market in Mainland China.\n- In October, a conference on Asia-Pacific economies was co-hosted with the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, with the theme \"Resilience of Regional Economies in a Volatile Global Environment.\" The conference attracted senior officials from several central banks, leading academics, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who participated in interactive roundtable discussions on the most pressing issues facing Asia-Pacific economies and exchanged views. The topics discussed were broad, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spill-overs from the slowdown in the Mainland economy to other parts of the region, and the impact on and outlook for Asia's potential growth.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and consistency that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"年度夏季研討會\" as \"HKIMR Summer Workshop,\" \"中國內地\" as \"Mainland China,\" \"資產質素\" as \"asset quality,\" and \"內地\" as \"Mainland.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key events (the two conferences and the 21 seminars) are clearly conveyed.\n- The translations are fluent and grammatically sound, with only minor variations in word choice.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Economic Conference\" while others use \"Economic Forum\" or \"Economic Symposium.\" The original text uses \"經濟研討會,\" which is best translated as \"Economic Workshop\" or \"Economic Conference.\" \"Symposium\" and \"Forum\" are less precise in this context.\n- **Redundancy and Word Choice:** Some translations use \"small-scale\" or \"open small seminars,\" which are not in the original text and may be unnecessary. The original uses \"公開小型研討會,\" which is best translated as \"public seminars\" or \"public small-scale seminars,\" but \"small-scale\" is optional.\n- **Variation in \"研討會\" Translation:** Some translations use \"workshops,\" others use \"seminars,\" and one even uses \"symposiums.\" While these are all acceptable, \"seminars\" is more consistent with the term \"研討會\" in academic contexts.\n- **\"HKIMR\" Usage:** Only some translations include \"HKIMR\" in the event name, which is important for clarity and branding. The original text uses \"年度夏季研討會,\" which is explicitly \"HKIMR Summer Workshop\" in the dictionary, so it should be included in all event names.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKIMR Summer Workshop\" consistently for \"年度夏季研討會.\"\n- Use \"Economic Conference\" for \"中國內地經濟研討會\" to maintain consistency with the dictionary and the formal tone of the original.\n- Use \"seminars\" for \"研討會\" to align with academic and professional contexts.\n- Avoid unnecessary adjectives like \"small-scale\" unless explicitly stated in the original.\n- Ensure that all event names are consistent and include \"HKIMR\" where appropriate.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would maintain consistency in terminology, use \"seminars\" for \"研討會,\" and ensure that all event names are accurately and consistently translated.\n---\nThe Research Center also held the \"14th HKIMR Summer Workshop\" in August and the \"14th Mainland China Economic Conference\" in September, discussing asset quality and financial stability issues of Mainland banks. The aforementioned conferences and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and central banks around the world. The Research Center also organized 21 public seminars throughout the year, discussing a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial topics.\n\n# Paper money and coins\" is a straightforward and accurate translation of \"紙幣及硬幣.\" However, \"banknotes\" is a more formal and commonly used term in financial contexts, making \"Banknotes and coins\" a slightly more refined option. The use of a hash symbol (#) in translations 3 and 4 is unnecessary unless the original text specifically includes it for formatting purposes, which it does not. The repetition of \"Paper Money and Coins\" in translations 5 and 6 is redundant and lacks variation.\nConsidering these points, \"Banknotes and coins\" offers the best balance of accuracy, formality, and clarity.\nBanknotes and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (referring to notes issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 407.8 billion, representing an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation was HKD 11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued notes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 notes in circulation was HKD 4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer banknotes.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10

The HKMA strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions' (AIs) risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems during the year. Given the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, the HKMA also enhanced its oversight of AIs' technology risk management. To align with the HKMA's commitment to combating financial crime, the effectiveness of AIs' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls remained a key regulatory focus. In regulating the conduct of AIs, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric culture and advance financial inclusion, as well as address challenges faced by overseas SMEs and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also intensified its oversight of AIs' methods of selling investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, the HKMA has made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"off-site reviews,\" \"authorized institutions (AIs),\" \"CAMEL ratings,\" \"corporate governance,\" \"independent non-executive directors (INEDs),\" \"external auditors,\" and \"remuneration systems.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent and accurate across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended message clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly less precise terms, such as \"risk management\" instead of \"risk governance\" in the second and third translations, which may not fully capture the nuance of the original Chinese.\n- The phrase \"enhance risk governance and corporate culture\" is more precise than \"enhance risk management and corporate culture\" in the second and third translations.\n- The use of \"trilateral meetings\" in the second and third translations is less common than \"tripartite meetings\" or \"joint meetings\" in formal contexts.\n- The phrase \"help promote effective risk management\" in the fourth translation is slightly less formal than \"contribute to promoting effective risk management\" or \"were conducive to effective risk management.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"risk governance\" consistently where the original Chinese implies governance structures, not just management.\n- Use \"tripartite meetings\" or \"joint meetings\" instead of \"trilateral meetings\" for consistency with formal terminology.\n- Use \"contribute to promoting effective risk management\" or \"were conducive to effective risk management\" for a more formal and precise tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 188 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management of authorized institutions. The HKMA strengthened its engagement with the boards of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with the boards or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (INEDs) to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions contribute to promoting effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy, the HKMA reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III capital buffers in 2019. The solvency stress testing programme for authorized institutions has also been improved in response to the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides feedback on areas requiring improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to conduct thematic reviews in conjunction with regular on-site inspections, with thematic reviews primarily targeting areas assessed as higher risk. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate supervisory resources to address the various new and significant risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic reviews. The focus of these inspections and reviews remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks related to Mainland-related business; another key focus was anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic reviews concerning liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialist inspection teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\nThe original text is a heading, likely from a financial or economic report. The dictionary provides exact translations for the terms \"信貸增長\" and \"資產質素\" as \"credit growth\" and \"asset quality,\" respectively. All junior translators have correctly used these translations. However, there are differences in formatting.\nThe first and sixth translations use lowercase without any formatting, which may be appropriate for a subheading or a section title in a document. The second, third, fourth, and fifth translations use uppercase and include a hash symbol (#), which is commonly used for headings in markdown or web content. The choice between these formats depends on the intended use of the text.\nThe most neutral and universally applicable format is to use title case with a hash symbol, as it is commonly used in professional and academic contexts for section headings. Therefore, the best possible translation would be:\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank loans grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loans increased by 6.5% for the year, compared to a 3.5% increase in 2015 (Table 2). As the growth in customer deposits exceeded the growth in bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\nThe original text is a simple title for a table, \"表 2 貸款及墊款的增長,\" which translates to \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances.\" The junior translators have provided several variations of this title, with minor differences in punctuation and word order.\nThe first, third, and sixth translations use a colon after \"Table 2,\" which is the most standard and formal way to introduce a title or subtitle in English. The second and fourth translations omit the colon, which is less formal and may be acceptable in some contexts, but not ideal for a table title. The fifth translation, \"Table 2 Loan and Advance Growth,\" reorders the words and uses \"Loan and Advance Growth\" instead of \"Growth of Loans and Advances,\" which is less natural and slightly less precise.\nThe term \"貸款及墊款\" is translated as \"Loans and Advances\" in all translations, which is accurate and appropriate. \"貸款\" is correctly translated as \"Loans,\" and \"墊款\" as \"Advances,\" which is a standard financial term. The term \"增長\" is translated as \"Growth\" in all translations, which is also correct and natural in this context.\nThe best translation would be \"Table 2: Growth of Loans and Advances,\" as it is the most standard and formal, with proper punctuation and word order. It accurately reflects the original Chinese title and is the most natural and professional translation.\n\nThe original text discusses the increase in related loans in the Mainland, with specific figures and a breakdown of the amount attributed to subsidiaries of Hong Kong-registered banks. The dictionary provides exact translations for \"附屬公司\" (subsidiary), \"內地\" (Mainland), and \"香港\" (Hong Kong), which must be used as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"subsidiary\" correctly. However, \"operating in the Mainland\" is slightly redundant, as the context already implies the location.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"located in the Mainland\" is awkward and could be simplified. Also, the structure \"which includes... which are part of...\" is redundant and could be streamlined.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"subsidiaries\" correctly and maintains clarity and fluency. The phrase \"operating in the Mainland\" is slightly wordy but acceptable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation has several errors. \"Mainland China\" is redundant since \"Mainland\" is already used. The figure \"35,640 billion\" is incorrect (should be 356.4 billion). Also, \"545 billion\" is incorrect (should be 54.5 billion).\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation has a major error in the figures: \"5,450 billion\" is incorrect (should be 54.5 billion). The phrase \"based in the Mainland\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a major error in the figures: \"HK$3,564 billion\" is incorrect (should be 356.4 billion). Also, \"HK$545 billion\" is incorrect (should be 54.5 billion). The phrase \"that are located in the Mainland\" is redundant.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact terms from the dictionary: \"subsidiary,\" \"Mainland,\" and \"Hong Kong.\"\n- Correctly represent the figures: 35,640億港元 = 356.4 billion HKD, and 5,450億港元 = 54.5 billion HKD.\n- Be fluent, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate.\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe total amount of related loans in the Mainland increased by 7% to HKD 356.4 billion by the end of 2016 (Table 3), which included HKD 54.5 billion in loans accounted for by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong operating in the Mainland.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"內地\" is translated as \"Mainland,\" \"特定分類貸款比率\" as \"classified loan ratio,\" and \"資產質素\" as \"asset quality.\" However, there are subtle differences in tone and precision that can be refined for clarity and naturalness.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations maintain the core meaning and structure of the original text.\n- The use of \"classified loan ratio\" and \"asset quality\" is consistent with the dictionary.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended financial information clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"retail banking\" while others use \"retail banks.\" While both are acceptable, \"retail banks\" is more precise in a financial context.\n- The phrase \"the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000\" is slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000.\"\n- Some translations use \"the banking sector as a whole\" or \"the overall banking sector,\" which are all correct, but \"the entire banking sector\" is more concise and commonly used in financial reporting.\n- The phrase \"followed a similar trend throughout the year\" is slightly more natural than \"showed a similar trend during the year.\"\n- The use of \"year-on-year\" or \"compared to the previous year\" is more precise than \"a year earlier\" in financial contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"retail banks\" consistently for clarity.\n- Use \"the entire banking sector\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"followed a similar trend throughout the year\" for natural flow.\n- Use \"year-on-year\" or \"compared to the previous year\" for precision in financial reporting.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained robust in 2016. Although the classified loan ratio for retail banks rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the classified loan ratio for the entire banking sector increased from 0.73% to 0.85%. Throughout the year, the asset quality of Mainland-related loans in the banking sector followed a similar trend; concurrently, the classified loan ratio for these loans in retail banks rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and the corresponding ratio for the entire banking sector also rose slightly from 0.77% to 0.80% year-on-year.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"loan classification and provisioning systems,\" \"Mainland China,\" \"privately owned enterprises,\" \"debt securities,\" \"yield enhancement,\" \"authorized institutions\/AIs,\" and \"thematic reviews.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and precision that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and maintain the formal tone appropriate for regulatory texts.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, preserving the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"sustained increase\" which is slightly more formal and less common in regulatory contexts compared to \"increasing\" or \"continuing increase.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"closely monitored\" which is slightly more active than \"pays particular attention to,\" but still acceptable.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"practices of authorized institutions\" which is slightly wordy compared to \"of authorized institutions.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Mainland China private enterprises\" instead of \"Mainland China's privately owned enterprises,\" which is less precise.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"lending approval standards\" instead of \"credit approval standards,\" which is a minor deviation from the dictionary term.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"risk-taking\" instead of \"risk exposure,\" which slightly changes the nuance of the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"increasing\" or \"continuing increase\" instead of \"sustained increase\" for consistency with regulatory language.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" or \"AIs\" consistently, depending on the desired level of formality.\n- Ensure that \"Mainland China's privately owned enterprises\" is used for clarity and precision.\n- Use \"credit approval standards\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"risk exposure\" rather than \"risk-taking\" to maintain the original nuance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA has invested significant regulatory resources to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. The HKMA also pays particular attention during the regulatory process to the continuing increase in risk exposure of authorized institutions to Mainland China's privately owned enterprises, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities for yield enhancement. In addition, the HKMA has conducted thematic reviews on the credit risk management of authorized institutions in the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\nThe original text is a single term, \"物業按揭貸款,\" which is directly translated as \"property mortgage lending\" in the provided dictionary. All junior translators have correctly used this exact translation, though some have included the \"#\" symbol, which is not present in the original text and appears to be an unnecessary addition. The most accurate and fluent translation is simply \"property mortgage lending,\" without any additional characters. The best possible translation is therefore \"property mortgage lending.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and precision that require careful evaluation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構.\"\n- The term \"countercyclical prudential measures\" is used in some translations, which is more precise than \"countercyclical measures\" in others.\n- The use of \"debt servicing ratio (DSR)\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" is consistent with the dictionary options, though \"Ioan-to-value ratio\" is a misspelling of \"loan-to-value ratio\" and should be corrected.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely clear and follows the original text's logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"property loan business\" while others use \"property lending business\" or \"residential mortgage loan activities.\" The dictionary lists \"residential mortgage loans\" and \"RMLs\" as acceptable translations for \"住宅物業按揭貸款,\" so using \"residential mortgage loans\" is more precise.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"when the HKMA had not yet introduced its first round of countercyclical prudential measures for property loans,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing would be preferable.\n- **Use of \"Ioan-to-value ratio\":** This is a clear misspelling of \"loan-to-value ratio\" and should be corrected.\n- **\"Newly originated\" vs. \"new\":** While \"newly originated\" is technically accurate, \"new\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and is more natural in this context.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"residential mortgage loans\" consistently for \"住宅物業按揭貸款.\"\n- Use \"loan-to-value ratio\" instead of \"Ioan-to-value ratio.\"\n- Use \"debt servicing ratio (DSR)\" or \"debt servicing ratio\" consistently for \"供款與入息比率.\"\n- Use \"countercyclical prudential measures\" for \"逆周期措施\" as it is more precise and aligns with the dictionary.\n- Ensure the sentence structure is fluent and natural, avoiding overly wordy or awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to closely monitor the property lending business of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical prudential measures for property loans, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt servicing ratio for new residential mortgage loans also declined from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on the debt servicing ratio, to 34% in December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt Servicing Ratio for New Residential Mortgage Loans  \nThe HKMA introduced a cap on the debt servicing ratio before implementing the first round of countercyclical prudential measures for property loans.\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical prudential measures introduced by the HKMA in February 2015, authorized institutions using the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% risk-weight floor from new mortgage financing to their entire residential mortgage financing portfolio. This regulation took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore property developers have been offering mortgage financing directly to property buyers this year, with their loan-to-value ratios often exceeding the levels permitted under the HKMA’s prudential requirements for authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their risk exposure to property developers. In addition, at the request of the HKMA, the Land Registry has agreed to provide the e-Alert service to authorized institutions. Authorized institutions using this service will receive electronic alerts from the Land Registry when other mortgage documents related to properties they have mortgaged are submitted for registration. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgage loans on the same property without prior approval from the authorized institution holding the mortgage. The Land Registry launched the e-Alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nLike other international financial centres, Hong Kong faces increasingly severe cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from authorized institutions about cases of unauthorized stock trading and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, and promptly took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued electronic banking service alerts to remind the public to be cautious of online stock trading scams and recommended preventive measures. It also issued notices to authorized institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be adopted to further strengthen the monitoring of online banking services. Regarding the cases of attempted infiltration of banking payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorized institutions to be vigilant about such scams when the first such case was discovered in Hong Kong. With the assistance of the police, it explained the modus operandi of these scams and required authorized institutions to take these methods into account when enhancing their monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the cyber resilience of the banking system, the HKMA launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) in May 2016. This initiative comprises three pillars: the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF), a professional training program, and the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform (see the \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" section under the \"Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\" chapter). In December, the HKMA issued a notice to authorized institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework.\n\nFintech applications in the banking industry saw significant development in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Particularly notable were developments in the areas of person-to-person (p2p) small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the HKMA introduced the \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to test their fintech initiatives in a controlled environment without fully complying with the HKMA's regulatory requirements. This arrangement enables authorized institutions to collect real data and user feedback early on before officially launching fintech services, allowing for appropriate adjustments. By the end of 2016, a total of six applications using the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox were approved, with the new fintech products involving biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology used for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for p2p small-value payment services via online banking without requiring dual authentication to HKD 5,000 per account per day, to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, several property-related fraud cases occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners in an attempt to gain benefits by applying for mortgage financing or selling the relevant properties. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the HKMA still closely collaborated with the police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such fraud cases within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the Operational Incidents Watch, sharing lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred at authorized institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site inspections and thematic reviews of authorized institutions' operational risk management systems, fraud management practices, trustee\/custodian operations, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent rogue or unauthorised trading activities.\n\n# Regulation of Treasury Activities and Liquidity Risk\n\nSeveral junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. Here is a critical review of their translations:\n**Translation 1** is well-structured and uses appropriate terminology. It correctly uses \"ramifications\" for \"影響\" and \"Federal Open Market Committee\" and \"Federal Funds Rate\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of the abbreviated \"HKMA,\" which is less concise.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate and concise. It uses \"HKMA\" as required and \"ramifications\" for \"影響.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"regulatory bodies\" instead of \"regulators,\" which is slightly less direct but still acceptable.\n**Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1 and is also accurate. It uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less preferred in formal or professional contexts.\n**Translation 4** is accurate and concise. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"ramifications\" correctly. However, it uses \"impact\" instead of \"ramifications\" for \"影響,\" which is not in line with the dictionary. This is a critical error.\n**Translation 5** is accurate and well-written. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"ramifications\" correctly. However, it uses \"impact\" instead of \"ramifications\" for \"影響,\" which is a deviation from the dictionary.\n**Translation 6** is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"ramifications\" correctly. However, it uses \"multiple times throughout the year\" for \"在年內多次大幅波動,\" which is slightly wordy and less natural than \"multiple significant fluctuations throughout the year.\"\n**Improvements and Reasoning:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"ramifications\" for \"影響\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- Use \"Federal Open Market Committee\" and \"Federal Funds Rate\" as specified.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, avoiding redundancy or overly wordy expressions.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is clear and flows naturally in English.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would incorporate the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms and ensuring natural English expression.\nSeveral major political events occurred in 2016, leading to multiple significant fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. At the same time, U.S. interest rates continued to normalize slowly, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided in December to raise the Federal Funds Rate, the second such increase since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the HKMA continued to maintain close contact with overseas regulators, assessed the ramifications for Hong Kong’s banking system, and required banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to cope with adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducts additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system's ability to cope with potentially severe stress scenarios and follows up with authorized institutions to strengthen their capacity to respond. Following a round of on-site reviews conducted by the HKMA in 2015 on interest rate risk management, further on-site reviews were carried out to evaluate the market risk management of authorized institutions, and those institutions found to have deficiencies in monitoring were required to take corrective actions.\n\n# Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"off-site reviews,\" \"authorized institutions,\" \"risk-based approach,\" \"transaction monitoring,\" and \"sanctions compliance.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key message about the HKMA's regulatory activities is preserved.\n- The use of \"authorized institutions\" or \"AIs\" is appropriate, though \"AIs\" is less formal and may be better reserved for internal or technical contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use \"ML\/TF\" (e.g., Translation 2), which is acceptable in certain contexts but may be less clear to a general audience. The full term \"money laundering and terrorist financing\" is more universally understood.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"regulatory contact with authorized institutions on specific matters\" (Translation 3), which is grammatically correct but less fluid than \"regulatory contacts with authorized institutions regarding specific events.\"\n- **Precision in Meaning:** Translation 5 uses \"regulatory outreach\" instead of \"regulatory contacts,\" which introduces a slight shift in meaning. \"Outreach\" implies a more proactive or promotional effort, whereas the original text refers to routine regulatory communication.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Dedicated supervisory staff\" (Translation 5) is slightly more formal than \"specialized regulatory staff\" or \"specialized regulatory personnel,\" which are more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should maintain clarity, consistency, and fluency while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.\n- \"Money laundering and terrorist financing\" is preferable to \"ML\/TF\" for general readability.\n- \"Regulatory contacts\" is more precise than \"regulatory outreach\" or \"regulatory engagement\" in this context.\n- \"Specialized regulatory staff\" is a balanced and commonly used term in regulatory contexts.\n- The phrase \"the scope of the reviews covers\" (Translation 5) is slightly awkward; \"the reviews cover\" is more direct and natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA's risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing includes on-site and off-site reviews (including regulatory contacts with authorized institutions regarding specific events), primarily targeting areas with higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The reviews cover the authorized institutions' assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of the risk-based approach, as well as the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the HKMA's specialized regulatory staff conducted 17 on-site reviews and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the HKMA prioritizes addressing difficulties that certain industries and individuals face in opening bank accounts, and issues guidance and \"frequently asked questions\" to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA's regulatory expectations regarding the risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continues to work closely with industry associations to issue guidance to assist authorized institutions in managing risks in certain areas, such as trade-based money laundering.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證\n\n圖2 人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Last year’s tax revisions helped create a favorable environment, attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. During the year, the HKMA granted 13 licenses to SVF issuers. Hong Kong’s robust fiscal performance and substantial net foreign assets continue to be confirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its triple-A rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"renminbi liquidity support,\" and \"international financial centre.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, clarity, and precision that can be refined for maximum clarity and natural English expression.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message of the original text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely parallel, maintaining the logical flow of the original text.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and use appropriate vocabulary.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly wordy or redundant phrasing, such as \"the mechanism for cross-border stock market trading between Shenzhen and Hong Kong\" in Translation 2, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.\n- The phrase \"seven out of ten\" in Translations 4 and 5 is less formal and less precise than \"approximately 70%,\" which is more commonly used in formal writing.\n- The use of \"International Financial Centre\" with a capital \"I\" in some translations (e.g., Translation 3 and 6) is inconsistent with the dictionary entry, which lists both \"international financial centre\" and \"International Financial Centre.\" However, the lowercase version is more standard in formal writing unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Some translations use \"enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\" while others use \"enhancing Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre status.\" The former is more natural and fluid in English.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"approximately 70%\" instead of \"seven out of ten\" for clarity and formality.\n- Maintain consistency in the use of \"international financial centre\" with lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Simplify phrases like \"mechanism for cross-border stock market trading between Shenzhen and Hong Kong\" to \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism\" to avoid redundancy.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"marking another milestone in Mainland capital account liberalisation\" is used consistently and clearly.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nAffected by fluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the renminbi exchange rate outlook, global offshore renminbi business slowed down in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global offshore renminbi business hub, processing approximately 70% of global renminbi payment activities. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism, launched in December, marked another milestone in Mainland capital account liberalisation and represented an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding renminbi liquidity support to the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of renminbi market liquidity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"IFFO,\" \"tax asymmetry,\" \"sovereign wealth fund,\" and \"overseas office.\" However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and word choice that can be refined for greater clarity and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message of the original text, including the establishment of IFFO, the number of partner institutions, legislative changes, and the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's overseas office in Hong Kong.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations, ensuring that key terms are translated as specified.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and maintain a formal tone appropriate for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly different phrasing, such as \"develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre\" versus \"develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre.\" While both are acceptable, \"develop Hong Kong as\" may be more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"the number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong\" appears in some translations, while others use \"asset owners with a presence in Hong Kong.\" \"Institutional investors\" is more precise and aligns better with the term \"機構投資者\" in the original text.\n- The phrase \"bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services sectors\" is used in some translations, while others use \"creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors.\" Both are acceptable, but \"bringing\" may be more active and direct.\n- Some translations use \"the institution's only office located outside Abu Dhabi,\" while others use \"the only office of the institution outside Abu Dhabi.\" Both are correct, but the latter is slightly more concise.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre\" for consistency and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"institutional investors\" instead of \"asset owners\" to align with the original term \"機構投資者.\"\n- Use \"bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services sectors\" for a more active tone.\n- Use \"the institution's only office outside Abu Dhabi\" for conciseness.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would incorporate the most natural phrasing, precise terminology, and active voice while maintaining the formal tone of the original text.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully promoted the passage of legislative changes to eliminate tax asymmetry and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and Mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, thereby bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the institution's only office outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, word choice, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Dictionary Compliance**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong,\" \"IMF,\" \"Article IV Consultation,\" and \"credit rating.\" This is a strong point across all translations.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are grammatically sound, but some variations in phrasing affect fluency. For example, \"gave a positive evaluation\" vs. \"gave a positive assessment\" are both correct, but \"assessment\" may sound slightly more formal and precise in this context.\n3. **Word Choice and Nuance**: The use of \"consolidate\" vs. \"strengthen\" or \"consolidating\" vs. \"consolidating\" is a minor but meaningful difference. \"Consolidate\" is more precise in the context of reinforcing or maintaining a position, which aligns well with the original Chinese term \"鞏固.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial terminology and maintain the formal tone expected in official reports or statements.\n5. **Variations in Verb Tenses and Structures**: Some translations use \"helped Hong Kong's credit ratings to be confirmed\" while others use \"contributed to the confirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings\" or \"helped secure confirmation.\" The latter options are more concise and natural in English.\n6. **Redundancy and Conciseness**: Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"credit rating agencies\" and \"major credit rating agencies.\" While not incorrect, it can be streamlined for better readability.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use precise terminology, and ensure clarity and conciseness. It should also reflect the nuance of the original Chinese, particularly in terms of commitment and effort. Based on the above analysis, the best translation would combine the strengths of the various versions, using \"assessment\" for a more formal tone, \"consolidating\" for precision, and a concise structure for the final sentence.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive assessment of our commitment to consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre during last year’s Article IV Consultation. Throughout the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussions, striving to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, which helped secure confirmation of Hong Kong’s credit ratings from major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Grammar and Subject-Verb Agreement**: \n   - Translation 5 uses \"plays\" instead of \"play\" in \"operation and continued development... plays a vital role,\" which is grammatically incorrect. The subject is plural, so \"play\" should be used.\n   - Translation 1 and 5 use \"Real time gross Settlement\" with inconsistent capitalization. The correct form should be \"Real Time Gross Settlement\" or \"RTGS\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Fluency and Word Choice**:\n   - Translation 1 uses \"consolidating Hong Kong's position as an International Financial Centre,\" which is slightly less natural than \"reinforcing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\" (used in Translation 6).\n   - Translation 4 incorrectly refers to the CMU as the \"central securities settlement system,\" which is not listed in the dictionary. The correct term is \"Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\"\n3. **Cultural and Terminological Accuracy**:\n   - All translations correctly use \"Hong Kong\" and \"offshore renminbi business hub\" as per the dictionary.\n   - The term \"RTGS\" is used correctly in most translations, though some use \"Real time gross Settlement\" with inconsistent capitalization.\n   - Translation 4 incorrectly uses \"central securities settlement system\" for CMU, which is a critical error.\n4. **Consistency and Style**:\n   - Translation 6 uses \"reinforcing Hong Kong's status\" and \"surpassing the target level,\" which are more natural and fluent than \"exceeding the target level\" used in others.\n   - Translation 2 uses \"continued development\" and \"crucial to consolidating,\" which are both accurate and natural.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use correct grammar and subject-verb agreement.\n- Adhere strictly to the dictionary terms.\n- Use natural, fluent English.\n- Maintain the formal tone appropriate for a financial context.\nBased on this, the best translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, ensuring correct terminology and grammar.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe safe and effective operation and continued development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a crucial role in reinforcing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub. The four Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) handling interbank transactions achieved 100% system availability in 2016, surpassing the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"stored value facility licences,\" \"e-Cheque,\" and \"crossboundary payments.\" The only notable variation is in the use of \"came into full effect\" versus \"came into effect,\" and \"scope\" versus \"coverage\" or \"service scope.\" Additionally, the fifth and sixth translations use \"the 'Payment Ordinance'\" instead of \"PSSVFO,\" which is acceptable but less precise since the full name is provided in the dictionary.\nThe phrase \"came into full effect\" is more precise than \"came into effect\" in this context, as the regulation was fully implemented in November 2016. The use of \"scope\" is more standard in formal writing than \"coverage\" or \"service scope.\" Furthermore, the phrase \"has also been extended\" is more natural than \"was also expanded\" in this context, as it reflects a completed action with ongoing relevance.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would retain the clarity and precision of the first translation while incorporating the most natural phrasing and terminology.\nThe HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong’s retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facility licences were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), which came into full effect in November 2016. The scope of e-Cheque services has also been extended to crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the HKMA established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key measures implemented during the year have achieved satisfactory progress.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and uses the correct dictionary terms. It uses \"Competency Framework\" and \"Consumer education programme\" as specified. However, it uses \"the entire industry\" instead of \"the entire banking sector\" or \"banking professionals across the industry,\" which may be less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"eCF\" instead of \"Competency Framework,\" which is an acceptable alternative from the dictionary. However, \"Consumer education programme\" is not capitalized consistently, and \"banking industry\" is used instead of \"banking professionals across the industry,\" which may be less specific.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and uses the correct dictionary terms. However, it omits the article \"the\" before \"Director Empowerment Programme\" and \"Consumer Education Programme,\" which may be considered less formal or less natural in English.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and uses the correct dictionary terms. It uses \"banking professionals across the industry\" for \"banking industry,\" which is more precise. However, \"Consumer education programme\" is not capitalized consistently.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses the correct dictionary terms, includes the article \"the\" before the program names, and uses \"banking professionals across the industry\" for clarity. It is fluent and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses the correct dictionary terms. However, \"Consumer education programme\" is not capitalized consistently, and \"a competency framework\" uses the indefinite article \"a\" instead of \"the,\" which may be less appropriate in this context.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the correct dictionary terms, maintain consistency in capitalization, and use precise language. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the closest to ideal, with only minor adjustments needed for consistency in capitalization and article usage.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA has introduced a series of measures to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry, including (i) launching the Director Empowerment Programme; (ii) establishing the Competency Framework for banking professionals across the industry; and (iii) implementing the Consumer Education Programme.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Offshore Renminbi Business\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and numerical formatting. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to ensure consistency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"renminbi,\" \"offshore renminbi business,\" and \"renminbi financial intermediation.\"\n- The structure and flow of the sentences are largely consistent with the original text.\n- The numerical data is accurately translated, with only minor variations in formatting (e.g., \"625.1 billion yuan\" vs. \"RMB 625.1 billion\").\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"yuan\" instead of \"renminbi\" for consistency, which is acceptable but not strictly required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"offshore renminbi business hub\" is only used in the first and sixth translations, which is a more precise term from the dictionary and should be used where appropriate.\n- The phrase \"renminbi pool\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary does not include this term. It is better to use \"renminbi liquidity pool\" or \"renminbi funding pool\" for clarity.\n- The term \"SWIFT\" is correctly used in all translations, but the full name \"SWIFT\" should be used on first mention, followed by the acronym in parentheses if needed.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"renminbi\" consistently for currency, as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"offshore renminbi business hub\" when referring to Hong Kong's role.\n- Ensure that \"renminbi liquidity pool\" or \"renminbi funding pool\" is used instead of \"renminbi pool\" for clarity.\n- Maintain consistency in numerical formatting (e.g., \"RMB 625.1 billion\" or \"625.1 billion renminbi\").\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translations, ensuring consistency with the dictionary and clarity in terminology.\n---\nIn 2016, volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the renminbi exchange rate outlook led to a slowdown in global offshore renminbi business. As of the end of the year, the combined total of renminbi customer deposits and outstanding certificates of deposit in Hong Kong amounted to RMB 625.1 billion, a decrease of 38% compared to the previous year (Figure 1). Renminbi bond issuance during the year fell to RMB 52.8 billion, and the value of renminbi trade settlement processed through Hong Kong banks also declined to RMB 454.21 billion. On the other hand, the outstanding balance of renminbi lending by Hong Kong banks as of year-end was RMB 294.8 billion, similar to the previous year (Figure 2). The transaction volume of the renminbi RTGS system remained high, with an average daily processing volume of RMB 863.6 billion in 2016. This demonstrates that, despite a reduction in the renminbi liquidity pool, a substantial amount of renminbi financial intermediation continues to be conducted in Hong Kong. According to statistics from SWIFT, Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of renminbi payment activities in 2016, demonstrating its position as the global offshore renminbi business hub.\n\nFigure 1: Renminbi Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates\nThe original Chinese text is \"圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證,\" which translates to \"Figure 1: Renminbi customer deposits and deposit certificates.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Figure 1: Renminbi Customer Deposits and Time Deposits\" – This translation incorrectly uses \"Time Deposits\" instead of \"Deposit Certificates.\" \"Time Deposits\" refers to a type of savings account with a fixed term, not a certificate.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Figure 1: Renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit\" – This is accurate, but \"certificates of deposit\" is more commonly abbreviated as \"CDs\" in financial contexts. Also, the capitalization of \"customer deposits\" is inconsistent with the dictionary entry.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Figure 1 renminbi customer deposits and deposit certificates\" – This translation lacks proper punctuation (colon after \"Figure 1\") and has inconsistent capitalization.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Figure 1 Renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit.\" – This is similar to the second translation but with a period at the end. It is grammatically correct but still uses \"certificates of deposit\" instead of the more direct \"deposit certificates.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Figure 1 Renminbi Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates\" – This translation is accurate, with proper capitalization and use of \"deposit certificates.\" However, it lacks a colon after \"Figure 1.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Figure 1: Renminbi Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates\" – This is the most accurate and well-formatted translation. It uses the correct terminology, proper capitalization, and includes the necessary punctuation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact term \"deposit certificates\" as specified in the dictionary, maintain proper capitalization, and include the correct punctuation. The sixth junior translator's version meets all these criteria and is the most polished and accurate. Therefore, the best possible translation is:\n**Figure 1: Renminbi Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates**\n\nFigure 2 Renminbi Financing Activities\nAll six junior translations are very similar, with only minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. The term \"人民幣\" is consistently translated as \"Renminbi,\" which is correct according to the dictionary. However, there is inconsistency in the capitalization of \"financing activities.\" While \"Financing Activities\" is more formal and appropriate for a title, \"financing activities\" is also acceptable in less formal contexts.\nThe best translation would be \"Figure 2 Renminbi Financing Activities,\" as it maintains proper capitalization for a title and uses the exact term \"Renminbi\" as specified in the dictionary.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA closely collaborated with relevant Mainland authorities to secure greater policy headroom and advance the development of Hong Kong's renminbi business. Several new measures were introduced during the year, including further expanding the openness of the Mainland's onshore interbank bond market and foreign exchange markets, as well as launching the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" in December. In response to increased demand for liquidity management arising from cross-border investment channels and markets, the HKMA expanded its Renminbi liquidity Facility. In October, the HKMA increased the number of Primary Liquidity Providers from seven to nine, and the total quota of the PLP scheme was raised from 14 billion renminbi to 18 billion renminbi. The HKMA also enhanced the transparency of the usage of its Renminbi liquidity Facility, helping participating banks to more effectively manage their liquidity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Hong Kong,\" \"Central government,\" \"offshore renminbi business,\" and \"13th Five-year plan.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of terms like \"affirmed,\" \"reaffirmed,\" and \"demonstrating\" effectively conveys the supportive stance of the Central government.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** The first and third translations use \"the national '13th Five-year plan'\" and \"the state's '13th Five-year plan'\" respectively, which are slightly less idiomatic than \"the national '13th Five-Year Plan'\" or \"the 13th Five-Year Plan.\"\n- **Capitalization:** The term \"Five-year plan\" should be capitalized as \"Five-Year Plan\" when referring to the official Chinese plan.\n- **Word Choice:** The phrase \"further development of offshore renminbi business\" is repeated in several translations, but \"further develop its offshore renminbi business\" (as in the sixth translation) is more concise and natural.\n- **Redundancy:** Some translations use \"again affirmed\" or \"once again affirmed,\" which are slightly redundant compared to \"reaffirmed.\"\n- **Punctuation:** The use of quotation marks and commas varies slightly, with some translations using straight quotes and others using smart quotes, which may affect readability in certain contexts.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following considerations should be made:\n- Use the official title \"13th Five-Year Plan\" with proper capitalization.\n- Choose the most natural and concise phrasing, such as \"reaffirmed\" instead of \"again affirmed.\"\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms like \"offshore renminbi business\" and \"Central government.\"\n- Use \"further develop its offshore renminbi business\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Maintain a formal yet fluent tone that aligns with the original text's context.\nBased on this reasoning, the improved translation would be:\nThe national \"13th Five-Year Plan,\" announced in March, reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a global offshore renminbi business hub, demonstrating the Central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore renminbi business.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore renminbi business. The HKMA also actively participates in various activities to promote Hong Kong as the global offshore renminbi business hub and as a key platform for the Mainland's \"go global\" strategy, including participation in local events organized by industry organizations and private institutions, as well as overseas events in Mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement\" or \"CEPA,\" \"Mainland,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"Hong Kong.\" However, some translations use \"Mainland\" inconsistently, sometimes omitting it when it should be included for clarity.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations vary in fluency. For example, the first translation uses \"aiming for basically achieving service trade liberalization,\" which is awkward. The second and fourth translations are more fluent, using \"basic realization\" and \"substantially liberalizing,\" respectively.\n3. **Vocabulary and Nuance**: The phrase \"basic realization\" (as in translations 2 and 5) is more natural than \"basically achieving\" or \"aiming for substantially liberalized.\" The term \"facilitation measures\" (used in translations 2, 3, and 6) is more precise than \"convenience measures\" or \"enhance convenience.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate. However, some translations use \"financial industry\" instead of \"financial sector,\" which is less common in official contexts.\n5. **Clarity and Precision**: The phrase \"explore further expansion of market access and facilitation measures\" (translation 2) is more precise than \"explore further expanding the opening up of the Mainland market\" (translation 3), which is somewhat redundant.\n**Improved Translation**:\nUnder the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), a new agreement on substantially liberalizing service trade between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The HKMA continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the existing arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expansion of market access and facilitation measures for Hong Kong’s financial sector in the Mainland market.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO's Mission\n\nIFFO's mission is to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO's functions are:  \n- To provide a platform for information exchange and sharing of experience;  \n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- To promote market and product development;  \n- And to facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nChief Executive of the HKMA Norman Chan (seventh from the left) raised a toast with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and grammatical precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify \"金管局\" as \"HKMA\" and \"國際貿易協會\" as \"international business council.\"\n- The term \"基建投融資\" is consistently translated as \"infrastructure investment and financing.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent, with the main idea of the HKMA establishing IFFO in July and the list of partner institutions being accurately conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Date Precision:** The first and second translations use \"January 31, 2017\" and \"January 1, 2017\" respectively, while others use \"the end of January 2017.\" The original text says \"截至2017年1月底\" which translates to \"as of the end of January 2017.\" The most accurate translation is \"as of the end of January 2017.\"\n- **Term Consistency:** \"機構投資者\" is translated as \"asset owners\" in some translations and \"institutional investors\" in others. The dictionary specifies \"asset owners,\" so this should be used consistently.\n- **IFFO Spelling:** The third and fourth translations use \"IFFo\" and \"IFFO\" respectively. The dictionary allows both, but \"IFFO\" is more commonly used in official contexts.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations use \"infrastructure projects development and operation entities\" or \"infrastructure projects developers and operators,\" which are awkward. The more natural phrasing is \"infrastructure project developers and operators.\"\n- **\"Public and Private Sector\" Terminology:** Some translations use \"public sector institutional investors\" and \"private sector institutional investors,\" which is more precise than \"public asset owners\" or \"private asset owners.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"as of the end of January 2017\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"asset owners\" for \"機構投資者.\"\n- Use \"IFFO\" consistently.\n- Use \"infrastructure project developers and operators\" for clarity.\n- Use \"public sector asset owners\" and \"private sector asset owners\" for precision.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA established IFFO in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector asset owners, private sector asset owners, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and the international business council (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made good progress since its establishment. Committed to enhancing skills, IFFO co-hosted an executive workshop in October with the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group and Eastspring Investments, focusing on \"Private Participation in Infrastructure Project Finance in Emerging Markets.\" The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, contributing to knowledge expansion and network building. IFFO also held a high-level seminar in November, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to deliver a speech and share his experience in the planning, operation, and management of infrastructure projects. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Hub, establishing a framework for cooperation. In December, it signed Memorandums of Understanding with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, facilitating infrastructure project financing for the two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities have helped strengthen Hong Kong’s position and international image as an infrastructure financing centre.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Memorandums of Understanding\" or \"MOUs\" for 《諒解備忘錄》, \"International Finance Corporation\" or \"IFC\" for 國際金融公司, and \"infrastructure investment and financing\" for 基建投融資.\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and conveys the intended message of the event and its purpose.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have awkward phrasing or grammatical errors. For example, in the second translation, \"Deputy CEO and Chief Executive\" is redundant and incorrect, as \"Chief Executive\" is the primary title.\n- **Title Consistency:** The title \"Chief Executive\" should be used consistently. Some translations use \"Chief Executive\" while others use \"Chief executive\" with a lowercase \"e,\" which is inconsistent.\n- **Name Accuracy:** There are variations in the spelling of the names, such as \"Le Roux,\" \"Lehoux,\" \"Le Roy,\" and \"Le Houerou.\" The correct spelling should be verified, but based on the original text, \"Philippe Le Roux\" is the most likely correct form.\n- **Position Titles:** The title \"Executive Vice President and Chief Executive\" is used in some translations, but the original text refers to \"執行副總裁兼首席執行官,\" which should be translated as \"Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer\" or \"Executive Vice President and Chief Executive.\"\n- **Clarity of Action:** Some translations use \"to facilitate collaboration between the two parties\" or \"to promote collaboration through the IFFO platform,\" which is correct, but the phrase \"to facilitate cooperation in utilizing the IFFO platform\" is more precise and aligns better with the original text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistent use of \"Chief Executive\" with a capital \"C\" and \"E.\"\n- Use the correct spelling of the names, such as \"Philippe Le Roux.\"\n- Use the full title \"Chief Executive Officer\" when appropriate.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"to facilitate cooperation in utilizing the IFFO platform\" is used for clarity and accuracy.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nChief Executive of the HKMA, Mr. Norman Chan (front left), and Mr. Philippe Le Roux, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Finance Corporation (front right), signed Memorandums of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in utilizing the IFFO platform, creating a more efficient and favorable market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA (front left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, Chief Executive of the Global Infrastructure Hub (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework and promote financing for infrastructure projects.\n\nThe original text describes a formal event where the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Norman Chan, and the Chairman of the China Development Bank (CDB), Hu Huaiyong, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enhance cooperation between the two institutions. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Correctly uses \"Memorandums of Understanding\" and \"China Development Bank.\" However, it omits the title \"Mr.\" for both individuals and lacks the \"(left)\" designation for Norman Chan, which is present in the original.\n2. **Second Translation:** Accurately includes titles and the \"(left)\" designation. However, it uses \"Hu Huabang\" instead of the correct \"Hu Huaiyong\" as per the dictionary. This is a critical error in the name.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"MOUs\" and correctly includes the \"(left)\" designation. However, it uses \"Hu Huibang\" instead of \"Hu Huaiyong,\" which is another name discrepancy.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Correctly uses \"Memorandums of Understanding\" and includes the \"(left)\" designation. However, it uses \"Hu Huaiwang\" instead of \"Hu Huaiyong,\" which is incorrect.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Correctly uses \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (singular) and includes the \"(left)\" designation. However, it uses \"Hu Huaiyong\" and \"collaboration\" instead of \"cooperation,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"Memorandums of Understanding\" and includes the \"(left)\" designation. However, it uses \"Hu Huaiyang\" instead of \"Hu Huaiyong,\" which is incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct name \"Hu Huaiyong\" as per the dictionary.\n- Include the \"(left)\" designation for Norman Chan.\n- Use \"Memorandums of Understanding\" or \"MOUs\" as appropriate.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow in English.\n- Maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nChief Executive of the HKMA, Mr. Norman Chan (left), and Mr. Hu Huaiyong, Chairman of the China Development Bank, signed Memorandums of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the HKMA.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Centres\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with government authorities to create a favorable tax environment for corporate treasury centres. Specifically, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (Revised Tax Regime) was passed in June, allowing companies to deduct interest expenses incurred in operating intra-group financing business when calculating profits tax, provided that certain conditions are met. Additionally, profits from specified treasury activities of qualifying corporate treasury centres are subject to a 50% reduction in profits tax (i.e., reduced to 8.25%). Table 2 briefly outlines key points of the Revised Tax Regime:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA has actively promoted the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland enterprises. As of the end of the year, the HKMA had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the HKMA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to help Chinese-funded enterprises in Hong Kong better understand and make greater use of our corporate treasury centres platform.\n\n# Promote Asset Management Services\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and word choice. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"SFC,\" \"overseas office,\" \"sovereign wealth fund,\" and others. However, there are subtle variations in tone, structure, and clarity that can be refined for maximum fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the logical flow of information.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and convey the intended meaning clearly.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, such as \"the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management reached 1,300 by the end of 2016, representing an annual increase of nearly 15%.\" While correct, \"representing\" could be replaced with \"which was a nearly 15% annual increase\" for smoother flow.\n- The term \"private equity firms\" is used consistently, but in the original Chinese, the term is \"私募基金公司,\" which is more accurately translated as \"private equity firms\" or \"private fund companies.\" However, \"private equity firms\" is the more standard term in financial contexts.\n- Some translations use \"asset owners\" for \"機構投資者,\" which is technically correct but less commonly used in financial English. \"Institutional investors\" is more standard.\n- The phrase \"the only office the institution has set up outside of Abu Dhabi\" is repeated in several translations. While accurate, it could be slightly rephrased for variety and clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"institutional investors\" instead of \"asset owners\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Replace \"representing an annual increase of nearly 15%\" with \"which was a nearly 15% annual increase\" for smoother flow.\n- Use \"established operations or affiliated companies\" consistently.\n- Ensure that the phrase about the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is concise and clear.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management stood at 1,300 by the end of 2016, which was a nearly 15% annual increase. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed corporations and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of the top 20 mutual fund companies in Mainland China, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with operations based in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office the institution has set up outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\nThe original text is a heading, likely from a document or article introducing a specific financial structure. The dictionary specifies that \"開放式基金型公司結構\" must be translated as \"open-ended fund company structure,\" which all junior translators have correctly used. However, the formatting and capitalization of the translations vary.\nThe first junior translator uses \"Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\" with proper capitalization and a period, making it a complete sentence. The second and third translations use lowercase or lack punctuation, which is less formal and less suitable for a heading. The fourth and sixth translations use the hashtag symbol, which is more appropriate for social media or informal contexts, not for a formal document. The fifth translation uses \"an\" instead of \"the,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context since it refers to a specific structure being introduced.\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and suitable for a formal heading. It should use \"the\" to refer to a specific structure and avoid unnecessary punctuation or informal elements like hashtags.\nTherefore, the best translation is: \"Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure.\"\n\nTo attract funds to register in Hong Kong, the HKMA continues to collaborate with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 was passed, introducing the open-ended fund company structure, which diversified Hong Kong's fund domiciliation platform and created a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international asset management centre.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use the required dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Islamic finance conferences,\" \"sukuk,\" and \"Hong Kong.\" The translations are consistent in conveying the core message of the original text, which is that the HKMA is working to increase awareness of Islamic finance and is preparing for the issuance of a third batch of sukuk.\nStrengths across the translations include:\n- Accurate use of the required terminology.\n- Clear and fluent English structure.\n- Proper use of financial and regulatory terminology.\n- Consistent message about the HKMA's efforts and collaboration with the government.\nWeaknesses or areas for improvement include:\n- Some translations use \"batches\" while others use \"tranches\" to refer to sukuk issuances. \"Tranches\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and may be more appropriate.\n- The phrase \"use Hong Kong's platform\" is slightly awkward; \"utilize Hong Kong's platform\" or \"use the Hong Kong platform\" may be more natural.\n- Some translations use \"strive to enhance\" while others use \"dedicate itself to increasing\" or \"be committed to increasing.\" While all are acceptable, \"strive to enhance\" is slightly more active and direct.\n- The phrase \"when market conditions are favorable\" is slightly more formal than \"when market conditions are suitable,\" but both are acceptable.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would maintain the clarity and fluency of the junior translations while refining the phrasing for naturalness and consistency with financial terminology.\nFinal Translation:\nThe HKMA continues to strive to enhance market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, including collaborating with industry associations to host and participate in Islamic finance conferences and seminars, and sharing experiences related to issuing sukuk with market participants, encouraging them to utilize Hong Kong's platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two tranches of sukuk, the HKMA has been working closely with the government to launch a third tranche of sukuk when market conditions are favorable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

markets. At the beginning of 2016, market concerns over a hard landing in the Mainland economy and a global economic slowdown led to a sharp decline in global equity markets. The outcomes of the Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November also came as surprises. Despite the challenging investment environment, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to strengthen the Exchange Fund's resilience, allowing the Exchange Fund to achieve an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary, and is invested in securities or other assets deemed appropriate after consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in tone, fluency, and precision that can be refined for clarity and natural English expression.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"Monetary Base,\" \"monetary and financial stability,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"US dollar-denominated assets.\"\n- The structure of the list (a) to (d) is preserved in all translations, maintaining the original intent.\n- The use of verbs such as \"ensure,\" \"safeguard,\" \"maintain,\" and \"seek\" is appropriate and consistent with the formal tone of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice and Tone:** Some translations use \"preserve\" or \"protect\" for \"保障資本,\" which is acceptable, but \"safeguard\" is more commonly used in financial contexts and may be more precise.\n- **Redundancy and Fluency:** Some translations use phrases like \"to the fullest extent possible\" or \"as much as possible,\" which are slightly wordy. \"To the extent possible\" or \"as far as possible\" are more concise and natural.\n- **Consistency in Structure:** Some translations use \"to ensure that...\" while others use \"ensuring that...\"—a mix of infinitive and gerund forms. For consistency, it is better to use one form throughout.\n- **Clarity of Purpose:** In (d), some translations use \"seek investment returns to the fullest extent possible\" or \"striving to achieve investment returns,\" which may not fully capture the nuance of \"在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"safeguard\" for \"保障資本\" to align with financial terminology.\n- Use \"to ensure that\" consistently for all items (a) to (d) to maintain parallel structure.\n- Use \"to the extent possible\" or \"as far as possible\" for \"盡量爭取\" to maintain conciseness.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"in accordance with the above (a) to (c)\" is used consistently to reflect the conditional nature of (d).\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:  \n(a) To safeguard capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the Monetary Base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek investment returns as far as possible, in accordance with the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, reflecting a policy or financial statement. The junior translators have all captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and fluency.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Exchange Fund\" and \"portfolio structure\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The use of \"take into account\" or \"address\" effectively conveys the meaning of \"全面顧及.\"\n- The phrase \"target asset allocation\" is more standard in financial contexts than \"target asset distribution,\" which is less commonly used in this context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"comprehensively consider,\" which is slightly less natural than \"fully take into account\" or \"fully address.\"\n- The second translation repeats \"the Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily, which can be seen as redundant.\n- The third translation uses \"target asset distribution,\" which is less standard than \"target asset allocation.\"\n- The fourth and sixth translations are nearly identical and use \"fully take into account,\" which is natural and fluent.\n- The fifth translation uses \"comprehensively take into account,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"fully take into account\" for clarity and fluency.\n- Use \"target asset allocation\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Avoid redundancy by not repeating \"the Exchange Fund\" unnecessarily.\n- Ensure the sentence flows smoothly and maintains a formal tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe above objectives fully take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor differences in terminology, phrasing, and punctuation. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\" with the full name and acronym, which is appropriate. The term \"bond markets and stock markets\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect. The use of \"ensuring the value and long-term purchasing power of assets\" is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has a few issues. It uses \"debt and stock market\" instead of \"bond and stock markets,\" which is slightly off. Also, \"member economies of the organisation for economic Cooperation and Development\" is awkward and inconsistent with the official name. The phrase \"long-term target of 71 to 29\" is slightly less natural than \"long-term target bond-to-equity mix of 71 to 29.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"bond and stock markets\" correctly and \"safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets\" is natural. However, \"the overall long-term target bond-to-equity mix of these two portfolios is 71 to 29\" is slightly wordy compared to more concise phrasing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but uses \"ample support\" instead of \"full support,\" which is a slight deviation from the original. It also uses \"bond market and stock market\" instead of \"bond and stock markets,\" which is slightly less natural. The phrase \"as stipulated by Currency Board arrangements\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is one of the best translations. It uses \"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\" correctly, and the phrasing \"to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power\" is natural and precise. The use of \"71:29\" is appropriate and concise. The only minor issue is the capitalization of \"Portfolio\" which is not necessary unless it is a proper noun.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"bond and stock markets\" correctly and \"safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets\" is natural. However, the phrase \"71% bonds and 29% equities\" is more explicit than necessary and slightly less concise than \"71 to 29.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be concise, use the correct terminology, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also use the exact terms from the dictionary where applicable. Based on the above review, the fifth and sixth translations are the strongest, but the fifth is slightly more concise and natural in phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund is primarily divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing full support for the Monetary Base in accordance with the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power. The overall long-term target bond-to-equity mix for these two portfolios is 71:29. In terms of the target currency mix, 91% of the assets are allocated to US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the HKMA is diversifying a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a broader range of asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas investment properties. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, but there is still room for increase as part of the Future Fund is allocated to long-term assets.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and clarity. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It accurately uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" as per the dictionary. The structure is clear and natural in English.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains a clear structure. The only minor issue is the placement of \"for strategic purposes,\" which is slightly less natural than in the first translation.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing, particularly in the phrase \"purchased for the Exchange Fund accounts for strategic purposes by the government.\" The structure is confusing and less fluent than the others.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses the dictionary terms appropriately and maintains a clear, natural flow. The phrase \"under the Exchange Fund's account\" is slightly less precise than \"for the Exchange Fund's account.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has a grammatical error: \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account\" is incorrect. \"Account\" should not be used as a direct object here. The phrase \"evaluation of the Exchange Fund's investments\" is slightly less precise than \"assessment of the Exchange Fund's investment performance.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, the phrase \"its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance\" is slightly redundant and could be more concise.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should also maintain the original meaning and nuance. Based on the above review, the first and second translations are the strongest, with the first being slightly more natural in phrasing. However, the fourth and sixth translations also offer strong alternatives.\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"Strategic Portfolio\" with a capital \"S\" as it is a proper noun.\n- Use \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"purchased by the government for strategic purposes for the Exchange Fund's account\" is clear and natural.\n- Use \"investment performance assessment\" as it is more precise than \"evaluation.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes for the Exchange Fund's account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund's investment performance.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in wording and structure. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Future Fund,\" \"Fiscal Reserves,\" \"investment portfolio,\" \"long-term growth portfolio,\" and \"portfolio mix.\" However, there are subtle variations in phrasing and clarity that can be refined for greater precision and naturalness in English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately reflect the original meaning and structure of the Chinese text.\n- The use of dictionary terms is consistent across all translations.\n- The translations are grammatically sound and maintain a formal tone appropriate for financial contexts.\n- The key financial concepts—such as interest rates being \"linked to the performance of the investment portfolio\" and the \"portfolio mix\" determining the actual rate—are clearly conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"statutory organizations\" while others use \"statutory bodies.\" While both are acceptable, \"statutory bodies\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for deposits in the Future Fund\" is slightly awkward in some translations. A smoother phrasing would be \"with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits.\"\n- The term \"long-term Growth portfolio\" in the fifth translation has a capital \"G\" in \"Growth,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry \"long-term growth portfolio\" (lowercase).\n- The use of \"allocation\" in the fourth and sixth translations is slightly more formal than \"proportion\" or \"share,\" which may be more natural in this context.\n- The phrase \"the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio\" is slightly repetitive and could be rephrased for clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"statutory bodies\" consistently.\n- Use \"Future Fund deposits\" rather than \"deposits in the Future Fund\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of terms like \"long-term growth portfolio.\"\n- Consider using \"proportion\" or \"share\" instead of \"allocation\" for clarity and naturalness.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and avoids redundancy.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from Fiscal Reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits. The interest rates on Future Fund deposits are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio mix. At the end of 2016, the proportion of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor inconsistencies and variations in terminology and phrasing. A critical review of each translation reveals the following:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Exchange Fund,\" \"strategic asset allocation,\" \"tactical asset allocation,\" \"tactical deviations,\" \"HKMA,\" \"Financial Secretary,\" and \"portfolio managers.\" However, some translations use \"strategic allocation\" and \"tactical allocation\" interchangeably, which may cause confusion. The original text clearly distinguishes between \"策略性資產分布\" (strategic asset allocation) and \"戰略性資產分布\" (tactical asset allocation), and this distinction should be preserved.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound and fluent. However, some translations use slightly more verbose or wordy phrasing, such as \"the distribution indicated by the investment benchmark\" or \"the optimal long-term asset distribution that the Exchange Fund can achieve in order to meet its investment objectives.\" These can be simplified for clarity and conciseness.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial terminology and maintain the formal tone of the original text.\n4. **Clarity and Precision**: Some translations use \"strategic distribution\" instead of \"strategic asset allocation,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary. This should be corrected to ensure consistency with the provided terminology.\n5. **Minor Errors**: One translation incorrectly states that the HKMA is authorized to determine \"strategic asset allocation,\" whereas the original text says the HKMA is authorized to determine \"戰略性資產分布\" (tactical asset allocation). This is a critical error that needs to be corrected.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should maintain the correct terminology, ensure clarity and conciseness, and preserve the formal tone of the original text.\nThe improved translation is as follows:\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, shows the optimal long-term asset allocation for the Exchange Fund to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic asset allocation as a guide to implement tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic asset allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations, while the HKMA is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the limits of tactical deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\nThe original text is a single term, \"直接投資,\" which is defined in the dictionary as \"Direct investment.\" All junior translators have correctly used this term, though there are minor variations in formatting. The first, sixth, and fifth translators used \"Direct investment\" without the hashtag, while the second, third, and fourth used \"# Direct investment\" or \"# Direct Investment.\" The use of the hashtag is unnecessary unless the text is intended for a specific platform or format that requires it, such as social media or markdown. Since no such context is provided, the hashtag should be omitted.\nAdditionally, there is a minor stylistic difference between \"Direct investment\" and \"Direct Investment.\" In English, \"investment\" is typically not capitalized unless it is part of a proper noun or title. Since \"Direct investment\" is a general term and not a title, it should remain lowercase after \"Direct.\"\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate translation is \"Direct investment,\" without the hashtag and with \"investment\" in lowercase. This version is the most neutral, accurate, and stylistically appropriate for general use.\n\nHKMA’s Reserves Management Department staff directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio is invested in global fixed-income markets and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through derivative overlay portfolios.\n\n# external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external managers to oversee approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, enabling the Fund to benefit from diversified investment approaches, while also allowing internal professionals to gain market knowledge and insights.\n\nThe original text discusses the expenses associated with employing external investment managers, listing specific costs and noting that these expenses vary annually due to market factors. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, which must be used exactly as specified.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"external managers\" and \"withholding and other taxes\" from the dictionary. However, \"are mainly affected by market factors\" is slightly less precise than \"are primarily due to market factors.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation uses \"external investment managers\" instead of \"external managers,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"ramifications\" incorrectly in the phrase \"mainly have ramifications due to market factors,\" which is awkward and misrepresents the original meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and conveys the meaning clearly. However, \"are mainly the ramifications of market factors\" is slightly awkward and less direct than \"are primarily due to market factors.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation uses \"subject to market ramifications,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term \"影響\" (influence\/impact). \"Ramifications\" implies consequences, not influence, which is a misfit in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses the dictionary terms and conveys the meaning clearly. The phrase \"primarily due to market factors\" is more precise than \"are mainly affected by market factors.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation uses \"transaction costs\" instead of \"transaction fees,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"subject to market ramifications,\" which is a misinterpretation of \"影響.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact dictionary terms, maintain fluency, and accurately reflect the original meaning. The phrase \"are primarily due to market factors\" is more precise and natural than \"are mainly affected by market factors.\" Additionally, \"transaction fees\" is the correct term from the dictionary, not \"transaction costs.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nExpenses related to employing external managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction fees, withholding and other taxes. These expenses vary each year primarily due to market factors.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text accurately, but they vary in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, the phrase “known as the 'Responsible ownership principles' ('Principles')” is slightly awkward. Also, “such investments” at the end is a bit vague.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is fluent and concise. It uses “entrusted with managing” which is slightly more formal than “appointed to manage,” but still acceptable. The phrase “these investments” is more specific than “such investments,” which is a minor improvement.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses the dictionary terms correctly. The phrase “the Principles of Responsible Ownership” is more formal and precise than “Responsible ownership principles.” However, the use of “their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies” is slightly redundant.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses “the relevant investments” at the end, which is more precise than “such investments.” The title of the document is translated as “Responsible Ownership Principles,” which is consistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very well-written and fluent. It uses “externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equity portfolios,” which is slightly more detailed than the dictionary term “external fund managers appointed to manage the Hong Kong equity portfolio.” However, it is still accurate and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very accurate and fluent. It includes the full name of the HKMA and SFC in parentheses, which adds clarity. The phrase “these investments” is used consistently and clearly.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The dictionary term “負責任的擁有權原則” should be translated as “Responsible Ownership Principles” (as in translations 3, 4, 5, and 6), which is more formal and precise.\n- “金管局” should be translated as “HKMA” (as in all translations).\n- “外匯基金” should be translated as “Exchange Fund” (as in all translations).\n- “外聘基金經理” should be translated as “external fund managers” (as in all translations).\n- “證券及期貨事務監察委員會” should be translated as “Securities and Futures Commission” (as in all translations).\n- “香港上市公司” should be translated as “Hong Kong-listed companies” (as in all translations).\n- “香港股票組合” should be translated as “Hong Kong equity portfolio” (as in all translations).\nThe best possible translation should combine the clarity of the sixth junior translator with the precision of the third and fourth. It should use the full name of the HKMA and SFC once, and then use the abbreviations for consistency. It should also use “the relevant investments” or “these investments” to maintain clarity.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports the \"Responsible Ownership Principles\" issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on March 7, 2016. The Principles are voluntary in nature and aim to help investors determine the best way to fulfill their ownership responsibilities regarding investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In relation to the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage the Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles when managing these investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Compliance\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced significant volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. Additionally, the HKMA employs risk-control tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to ensure the most effective use of investment management techniques by internal and external managers.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2016\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence. In terms of the stock market, concerns in January over a hard landing in the Mainland economy and a global economic slowdown led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which stabilized only by mid-February. In June, the Brexit referendum and in November, the results of the US presidential election were both unexpected, but stock markets quickly recovered from brief declines. Overall, global equity markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond market, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns about a global economic slowdown and low inflation. Coupled with the uncertainty brought about by the Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations of central banks maintaining accommodative policies, demand for safe-haven assets increased, supporting a solid performance for government bond markets in the first half of 2016. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, market expectations of a US interest rate lift-off intensified, especially after the US presidential election, leading to a sharp rise in US Treasury note yields. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the dollar index reaching a 14-year high. The sustained strength of the dollar was supported by the widening interest rate differentials between the dollar and other major currencies. Although the Japanese yen rose about 3% against the dollar, and the euro fell about 3% against the dollar, the British pound fell 16% against the dollar during the year, marking the largest decline since 2008, amid ongoing uncertainty caused by the Brexit referendum results.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Returns  \nStock market performance is calculated based on index price changes during the year.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant fluctuations in financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$68.1 billion in 2016, including HK$28.6 billion from overseas equity gains, HK$5.3 billion from Hong Kong equity gains, HK$33.1 billion from bond gains, HK$16.9 billion from other investments held by investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund, and a currency translation effect of HK$15.8 billion on non-HKD assets. Due to the sharp rise in the US dollar exchange rate last year, the currency translation effect on non-US dollar investments converted into Hong Kong dollars was unavoidable. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$700 million.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 361.87 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio amounted to HKD 181.8 billion, including HKD 116.8 billion in private equity and HKD 65 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments totaling HKD 133.8 billion.\n\nDespite the investment environment's ongoing challenges, the Exchange Fund recorded a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the Strategic Portfolio). The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of approximately 12% since its inception in 2009.\nDespite the investment environment's ongoing challenges, the Exchange Fund recorded a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the Strategic Portfolio). The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of approximately 12% since its inception in 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-dollar and non-HKD assets. We have also accelerated the diversification of our investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio. These measures have greatly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\nAll six translations are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be improved.\nTranslation 1 is fluent and accurate, using \"resilience to shocks\" which is a natural expression. It also uses \"defensive measures\" consistently.\nTranslation 2 uses \"defensive moves\" and \"resilience of the Exchange Fund,\" which are both acceptable, though \"moves\" is slightly less formal than \"measures.\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"defensive arrangements\" and \"diversified investment,\" which are slightly less idiomatic than \"measures\" and \"diversification.\"\nTranslation 4 uses \"non-dollar and non-hkd assets\" with lowercase \"hkd,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry \"non-HKD assets.\"\nTranslation 5 uses \"persistently deteriorating investment environment\" and \"resilience against shocks,\" which are both natural and precise. It also uses \"diversification efforts\" and \"investments within the long-term growth portfolio,\" which are slightly more wordy than necessary.\nTranslation 6 is very similar to Translation 1, but uses \"accelerated the diversification of our investments\" which is slightly more wordy than \"accelerated diversification of our investments.\"\nThe best translation would combine the strengths of these versions, using \"defensive measures,\" \"resilience of the Exchange Fund,\" and ensuring that \"non-dollar and non-HKD assets\" is used with proper capitalization. It should also maintain a consistent and natural flow.\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the HKMA has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-dollar and non-HKD assets. We have also accelerated the diversification of our investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio. These measures have greatly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 shows the Exchange Fund’s investment return rate in 2016 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rate over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.8%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate (1994–2016)\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary's requirement to use \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\" However, there are minor differences in punctuation, formatting, and phrasing that affect fluency and consistency.\n- **Translation 1** uses a colon after \"Figure 1\" and an em dash for the time range, which is standard in formal titles.\n- **Translation 2** omits the colon after \"Figure 1\" and uses \"returns\" instead of \"Return Rate,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- **Translations 3, 4, and 5** are identical and use \"to\" for the time range, which is acceptable but less formal than the em dash.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"return rates\" instead of \"Return Rate\" and also uses \"to\" for the time range.\nThe most consistent and formal option is **Translation 1**, which uses a colon after \"Figure 1\" and an em dash for the time range. It also uses \"Return Rate,\" which is the most precise term for \"回報率\" in this context. The use of \"Rate\" implies a measured value, which is appropriate for financial data.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would retain the structure of Translation 1, ensuring consistency in punctuation and terminology.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in terminology and phrasing that can be refined for clarity and consistency. \nFor the first sentence, all translations correctly use \"Strategic Portfolio\" or \"strategic portfolio\" as per the dictionary, though capitalization varies. The phrase \"investment return rate\" and \"return on investment\" are both acceptable, but \"return on investment\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. \"Investment returns\" is also acceptable but slightly more general. The use of \"does not include assets within the\" is consistent across translations, though \"within the Strategic Portfolio\" is slightly more precise than \"within the strategic portfolio\" due to the proper noun nature of \"Strategic Portfolio.\"\nFor the second sentence, all translations correctly use \"Composite Consumer Price Index\" as required by the dictionary. The phrasing \"calculated using the series with 2014\/2015 as the base period\" and \"calculated using a series with the base period of 2014\/2015\" are both grammatically correct, but the latter is slightly more natural and concise. The use of \"based on the base period\" in one translation is slightly redundant.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"return on investment\" for clarity and consistency with financial terminology, capitalize \"Strategic Portfolio\" as a proper noun, and use the most natural phrasing for the second sentence.\nThe improved translation is as follows:\n1. The calculation of return on investment does not include assets within the Strategic Portfolio.  \n2. The Composite Consumer Price Index is calculated using a series with the base period of 2014\/2015.\n\nTable 2: Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate: In Hong Kong Dollars\nThe original title, \"表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計,\" translates to \"Table 2: Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate: In Hong Kong Dollars.\" The junior translators have all correctly used \"Exchange Fund\" as required by the dictionary. However, there are variations in phrasing and punctuation that affect fluency and clarity.\nThe first and fourth translations are nearly identical and use \"In Hong Kong Dollars\" with a capital \"I\" and a colon, which is grammatically correct and stylistically consistent with formal titles. The second translation omits the colon and uses lowercase \"in,\" which is less formal and slightly less clear. The third translation uses \"Rate of Return\" instead of \"Return Rate,\" which is a more standard financial term, but the parentheses and lowercase \"hong kong dollars\" are less formal. The fifth translation uses \"investment returns\" instead of \"investment return rate,\" which is less precise and changes the meaning slightly. The sixth translation uses \"rate of return\" and parentheses, which is more standard but still less formal than the first and fourth translations.\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original, use the correct term \"Exchange Fund,\" and present the currency specification clearly. \"In Hong Kong Dollars\" with a capital \"I\" and a colon is the most appropriate choice for a formal table title.\nTherefore, the best possible translation is:\n**Table 2: Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate: In Hong Kong Dollars**\n\n1. The investment returns from 2001 to 2003 are expressed in U.S. dollars. 2. The calculation of investment returns does not include assets within the Strategic Portfolio. 3. The average returns for different periods are calculated using a compound annual method.\n\nTable 3: Currency Composition of Exchange Fund Assets as of December 31, 2016 (Including Forward Transactions)\n"}

However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and word choice that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"various channels\" and \"increasingly heavy workloads,\" which are natural expressions. However, \"various channels\" is slightly redundant since \"other various channels\" is repetitive.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first, with minor differences in prepositions and phrasing. It uses \"public education activities, and other channels,\" which is slightly more concise. The phrase \"increasingly heavy workload\" is singular, which is slightly less natural than the plural \"workloads.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is fluent and uses \"various other channels\" and \"increasingly demanding workloads,\" which are natural and precise. The use of \"to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"to meet the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the third, with the only difference being \"staff\" instead of \"employees.\" While both are acceptable, \"employees\" is more commonly used in formal contexts like this.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses \"community\" instead of \"society,\" which is a slight variation in meaning. \"Community\" may be slightly narrower in scope than \"society.\" It also uses \"exercising strict financial discipline,\" which is a slightly more active phrasing than \"strictly controlling financial discipline.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, but it omits the article \"the\" before \"HKMA\" in the first sentence, which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"implementing\" instead of \"implementation of,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and use natural English expressions. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text. Based on the above analysis, the third and fourth translations are the most fluent and natural. However, the third translation uses \"various other channels\" and \"increasingly demanding workloads,\" which are more precise and natural. The use of \"to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures\" is also more formal and precise.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with society and the market through media, public education activities, and various other channels to enhance the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen corporate governance, including promoting employee professional development, strictly controlling financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security, to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Institutional Development Through Public Engagement\n\n# Public Communications\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key data (e.g., 81 events, 326 press releases) are accurately conveyed.\n- The use of terms like \"press conferences,\" \"media interviews,\" and \"bilingual press releases\" is appropriate and consistent across translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Maintains close contact\" vs. \"maintains close communication\"**: While both are acceptable, \"maintains close communication\" is slightly more formal and precise in the context of institutional relations with the media.\n- **\"On-site interviews\" vs. \"site visits\"**: \"On-site interviews\" is more accurate in the context of media activities, as it refers to interviews conducted at a location, not a visit to a site.\n- **\"Public media events\" vs. \"public media activities\"**: \"Events\" is more precise in this context, as it refers to organized occasions, whereas \"activities\" is broader and less specific.\n- **\"Stand-up interviews\"**: This term is not standard in media contexts and may confuse readers. \"On-site interviews\" or \"live interviews\" would be more appropriate.\n- **\"Handled a large number of media inquiries daily\" vs. \"handled a large volume of media inquiries daily\"**: \"Volume\" is more formal and precise in a professional context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"maintains close communication\" for a more formal tone.\n- Use \"on-site interviews\" instead of \"site visits\" or \"stand-up interviews\" for clarity.\n- Use \"public media events\" for consistency and precision.\n- Use \"volume\" instead of \"number\" for a more professional tone.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains close communication with the media to enhance its transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 81 public media events, including 14 press conferences, 13 on-site interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. Throughout the year, it issued 326 bilingual press releases and handled a large volume of media inquiries daily.\n\nThis year, the HKMA established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain their functions and work plans, the HKMA carried out various public communication activities. In addition, the HKMA held media briefings and seminars to enhance the public's understanding of the HKMA's operations and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, reserves management, the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, cybersecurity, and small and medium-sized enterprises financing.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局總裁陳德霖先生於2016年12月出席香港銀行公會年度北京之行時會見記者。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"Mr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, met with journalists during his attendance at the Hong Kong Association of Banks' annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses the dictionary terms, and the sentence is grammatically sound.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"During his attendance at\" is slightly wordy and less natural than \"during\" or \"while on.\"  \n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"Chief Executive of the HKMA Norman Chan attended a press conference during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses the correct terms and is fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The original text mentions \"meeting with journalists,\" not a \"press conference.\" This introduces an assumption not present in the original.  \n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"Chief Executive of the HKMA Norman Chan met with journalists during the Hong Kong Association of Banks' annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Concise, accurate, and uses the correct terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The title \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" is placed before the name, which is less formal than placing it after.  \n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"Chief Executive of the HKMA, Norman Chan, met with journalists during his attendance at the Hong Kong Association of Banks' annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of terms and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Similar to Translation 1, \"during his attendance at\" is unnecessarily wordy.  \n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"Mr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, met with journalists during the Hong Kong Association of Banks' annual trip to Beijing in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of terms and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Trip to Beijing\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"Beijing trip.\"  \n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Norman Chan, met with reporters during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of terms and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Reporters\" is slightly less formal than \"journalists,\" though both are acceptable.  \n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms: \"Norman Chan,\" \"HKMA,\" and \"Hong Kong Association of Banks.\"\n- Be grammatically correct and fluent.\n- Avoid unnecessary wordiness.\n- Use \"journalists\" rather than \"reporters\" for consistency with the original.\n- Place the title after the name for a more natural and formal tone.\n### Final Translation:\n**Mr. Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, met with journalists during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual Beijing trip in December 2016.**\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for the public to obtain information about the functions and work of the HKMA. This service handled 10,170 enquiries in 2016, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. Approximately half of the enquiries concerned banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, and consumer banking matters, particularly banking products and services, the Coin Collection programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, stored value facilities, retail payment systems, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and prudential measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public inquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of various types of inquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year, and regularly updated the data in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and in-depth information and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary, banking, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 inSight articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, analyzing various topical issues related to the HKMA's work.\n\nThe original sentence is a straightforward news statement about an award received by the HKMA. The junior translators have all captured the essential information accurately, and all have used the correct dictionary terms. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, preposition usage, and phrasing that affect the overall naturalness of the English.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"HKMA,\" \"Hong Kong Management Association,\" and \"Best Annual Reports Awards.\"\n- The structure of the sentence is consistent across translations, with the main elements (subject, award, category, and event) all present.\n- The use of \"Silver Award\" and the category \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" is consistent and accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Preposition usage:** Some translations use \"at\" (e.g., \"at the Hong Kong Management Association’s Best Annual Reports Awards\"), while others use \"in\" or \"under.\" While all are grammatically acceptable, \"at\" is more commonly used in such contexts.\n- **Article usage:** Some translations use \"the\" before \"Best Annual Reports Awards,\" while others omit it. Including \"the\" is more natural in English when referring to a specific event.\n- **Fluency and natural phrasing:** The phrase \"in the Hong Kong Management Association's 2016 Best Annual Reports Awards under the 'Non-profit and charitable organizations' category\" (Translation 4) is slightly more wordy and less fluent than alternatives.\n- **Consistency in phrasing:** Some translations use \"won the Silver Award,\" while others use \"won a Silver Award.\" Both are correct, but \"won the Silver Award\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"the\" before \"Best Annual Reports Awards\" to indicate a specific event.\n- Use \"at\" to indicate the location of the award ceremony.\n- Use \"won the Silver Award\" for clarity and formality.\n- Maintain the exact category title as provided in the dictionary: \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" (with capitalization and spelling as given).\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA's 2015 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association's 2016 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"enhancing public understanding\" effectively and correctly divides the Information Centre into two sections. However, the phrase \"for visits and use\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"providing the public with information\" which is slightly more formal than the original. The structure is clear and the use of \"both of which\" is appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is concise and accurate. However, it omits \"for visits and use\" in the sentence about the opening hours, which slightly reduces clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is very similar to the first and is fluent and accurate. It uses \"introducing the public to the work of the HKMA\" which is slightly more natural than \"introducing the HKMA’s work to the public.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and clear. It uses \"two parts\" instead of \"two sections\" which is acceptable. However, \"currency and banking industry\" is slightly less precise than \"monetary and banking sectors.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and uses \"functions\" instead of \"work,\" which is a slight variation but still acceptable. It uses \"for six days a week\" instead of \"six days a week for visits and use,\" which is slightly less detailed.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"introducing the public to the work of the HKMA\" is more natural than \"introducing the HKMA’s work to the public.\"\n- \"Monetary and banking sectors\" is more precise than \"currency and banking industry.\"\n- Including \"for visits and use\" in the sentence about the opening hours adds clarity.\n- Using \"sections\" instead of \"parts\" is more consistent with the original text's terminology.\n- The phrase \"enhancing public understanding\" is more natural than \"raising public understanding.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, introducing the public to the work of the HKMA and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two sections: the exhibition area and the library, and is open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA, as well as the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and the handling of specific terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"資訊中心\" as \"Information Centre,\" \"金管局\" as \"HKMA,\" \"香港\" as \"Hong Kong,\" and \"維港\" as \"Victoria Harbour.\"\n- The overall structure and key points of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- Most translations effectively convey the purpose of the renovation, the interactive elements, and the mosaic artwork.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use awkward phrasing or overly literal translations. For example, \"striving to offer visitors a brand-new visiting experience\" (Translation 1) is slightly redundant and less natural than \"aiming to offer visitors a brand-new experience.\"\n- **Vocabulary Choice:** Some translations use less common or less natural phrasing, such as \"combine learning with play\" (used in several translations) is acceptable, but \"combine learning with fun\" (Translation 6) is more natural in this context.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"圖文並茂\" is translated as \"illustrative and text-based\" (Translation 1), \"richly illustrated\" (Translation 2), \"illustrated\" (Translation 3), \"visually appealing\" (Translation 4), \"featuring rich visuals and text\" (Translation 5), and \"touch-screen displays with rich visuals\" (Translation 6). The most natural and accurate translation is \"featuring rich visuals and text\" (Translation 5), which captures the essence of the original term.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"the renovated Information Centre\" in multiple sentences, which can be streamlined for better flow.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, natural, and concise, using vocabulary that is commonly used in English for such contexts.\n- It should avoid redundancy and ensure that the description of the interactive elements and the mosaic artwork is clear and engaging.\n- The phrase \"combine learning with fun\" is more natural than \"combine learning with play\" in this context.\n- The term \"圖文並茂\" should be translated as \"featuring rich visuals and text\" to capture the full meaning of the original term.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would integrate the strengths of all translations while addressing the weaknesses, ensuring clarity, fluency, and natural expression.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Information Centre’s policy exhibition area, which explains the HKMA’s work and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The renovation enriched the exhibition content and added various interactive elements, especially interactive games that combine learning with fun to explain financial concepts in an accessible and engaging manner. There are also touch-screen displays featuring rich visuals and text, providing a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the HKMA’s work, aiming to offer visitors a brand-new experience. In addition, the renovated Information Centre now features a mosaic artwork depicting Victoria Harbour, created using over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly renovated policy exhibition area was reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# HKMA Website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Register of AIs and local Representative offices,\" \"Register of SVF licensees,\" \"Coin Carts,\" and \"Coin Collection programme.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key information is preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"regulatory regime,\" \"stored value facilities,\" and \"Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Variation in terminology:** Some translations use \"institutional website\" while others use \"official website.\" While both are acceptable, \"official website\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"making it convenient for the public to access\" or \"facilitating the public's access to the HKMA's latest updates.\" These can be more naturally phrased.\n- **Consistency in acronyms:** The term \"IFFO\" is translated as \"IFFo\" in one translation and \"IFFO\" in others. The dictionary allows both, but \"IFFO\" is more consistent with the original text.\n- **Redundancy and clarity:** Some translations use phrases like \"important and timely matters\" or \"important timely matters,\" which are slightly redundant. \"Important and timely matters\" is more natural.\n- **Punctuation and formatting:** Some translations use inconsistent quotation marks (e.g., “Register” vs. \"Register\") and inconsistent capitalization for program names.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- Use \"official website\" instead of \"institutional website\" for clarity and common usage.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of acronyms like \"IFFO\" and \"SVF.\"\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"facilitates public access to\" or \"enables the public to access.\"\n- Maintain consistent quotation marks and capitalization for program names.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is fluent and avoids redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and both simplified and traditional Chinese, facilitating public access to the HKMA’s latest information. The website also contains the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions\" and the \"Register of AIs and local Representative offices,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of SVF licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated topic pages and prominent quick links to alert the public to the HKMA’s new measures, such as the regulatory regime for stored value facilities, IFFO and FFO, and important and timely matters, such as cautioning against telephone fraud and the locations of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection programme.\n\nThe original phrase, \"資訊中心政策展區的全新形象,\" translates to \"The new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area.\" The dictionary specifies that \"資訊中心\" must be translated as \"Information Centre,\" which all translations correctly apply.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The new look of the Information Centre’s policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"new look\" as a natural alternative to \"new image,\" which is fluent and idiomatic in English.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"New look\" is slightly less formal than \"new image,\" which may not match the tone of the original.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable, but \"new image\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately reflects the original phrase, with correct grammar and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, direct translation.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Appropriate for formal or institutional contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Information Centre Policy Exhibition Area's new image.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Information Centre\" and \"new image.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The possessive structure (\"Policy Exhibition Area's\") is awkward and less natural in English.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Slightly awkward phrasing may confuse readers.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The Information Centre’s new image display area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"new image display area,\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Misinterprets the original phrase. \"Display area\" implies a physical space for showing images, not the image itself.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Misleading in meaning.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The new image of the policy exhibition area in the Information Centre.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"new image\" and \"Information Centre.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase \"in the Information Centre\" is less direct than \"of the Information Centre's.\"  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable, but slightly less concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"New image of the Information Centre's Policy Exhibition Area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Information Centre\" and \"new image.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The lack of an article (\"The\") makes it slightly less natural in English.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness:** Acceptable, but could be improved with \"The.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be grammatically correct, fluent, and preserve the original meaning. The second junior translator's version, \"The new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area,\" is the most accurate and natural. It uses the correct term \"Information Centre,\" maintains the possessive structure to show the relationship between the policy exhibition area and the Information Centre, and uses \"new image\" to reflect the original phrase's intent.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic artwork created using Hong Kong coins to depict the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary terms correctly, using \"Information Centre\" and \"guided tours\" as required. However, there are subtle differences in fluency, grammar, and phrasing that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the required terms from the dictionary.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original Chinese, maintaining the key information about the number of visitors and guided tours.\n- The use of \"Figure 3\" is appropriately placed in parentheses in most translations, which is standard in formal writing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Verb Choice:** Some translations use \"welcomed\" while others use \"received.\" While both are acceptable, \"welcomed\" is more commonly used in the context of visitor services and may sound more natural in this context.\n- **Phrasing of \"580多次導賞服務\":** Some translations use \"provided more than 580 guided tours,\" while others use \"provided guided tours more than 580 times.\" The former is more concise and natural in English.\n- **\"人次\" in Translation 6:** The sixth translation incorrectly retains \"人次\" in English, which is a Chinese term. This should be translated as \"visits\" or \"visits by visitors\" to maintain clarity.\n- **\"Within the year\" vs. \"During the year\":** \"During the year\" is more standard and natural in formal English than \"within the year.\"\n- **\"Received a total of over 586,600 visitors\" vs. \"cumulatively welcomed over 586,600 visitors\":** The latter is more natural and consistent with the tone of the other sentences.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"welcomed\" consistently for a more natural tone.\n- Use \"provided more than 580 guided tours\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Ensure that all numerical expressions are consistent and natural in English.\n- Avoid mixing Chinese terms like \"人次\" in the final translation.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre welcomed over 56,200 visitors and provided more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has cumulatively welcomed over 586,600 visitors.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition area houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on topics such as Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking matters. The library also maintains an electronic register of authorized institutions (AIs) and their local representative offices, as well as employees engaged in securities business, as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA continues to organize public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. The topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Banking Stability, banknotes in Hong Kong, smart tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. Since their launch in 1998, the education seminars have attracted participation from over 56,400 citizens.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in various districts attended one of the public education lectures.\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are all grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning. However, there are subtle differences in fluency and formality that can be considered when selecting the best version.\nThe first translation, \"Figure 3: Types of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" uses \"Types of Groups,\" which is slightly less precise than \"Categories of Groups,\" as \"types\" may imply a more general classification rather than a structured categorization.\nThe second translation, \"Figure 3: Group categories visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is concise but lacks the article \"the\" before \"Group categories,\" which may make it sound slightly less formal.\nThe third translation, \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is well-structured, grammatically sound, and uses the correct article \"the\" before \"Information Centre.\" It also uses \"Categories of Groups,\" which is more precise than \"Types of Groups.\"\nThe fourth translation, \"Figure 3: Group categories that visited the Information Centre in 2016,\" is grammatically correct but slightly more wordy due to the use of \"that visited,\" which is not necessary in this context.\nThe fifth translation, \"Figure 3 Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is similar to the third translation but omits the colon after \"Figure 3,\" which is less standard in formal titles.\nThe sixth translation, \"Figure 3: Group categories of visitors to the Information Centre in 2016,\" is also grammatically correct but uses \"visitors\" instead of \"groups,\" which slightly changes the focus of the title.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation is the third one: \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016.\" It is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the most precise terminology.\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" as required by the dictionary. Below is a critical review of each translation:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"high-caliber workforce\" is slightly more formal than \"competent\" or \"excellent,\" but still appropriate. The sentence structure is clear and natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and well-structured. The use of \"competent workforce\" is slightly more neutral than \"excellent\" or \"high-caliber,\" but still appropriate. The phrase \"making optimal use of its existing staff\" is slightly more formal than \"reallocating existing staff.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: The translation is accurate and natural. The use of \"excellent workforce\" is slightly more emphatic than \"competent,\" but still appropriate. The sentence structure is clear and the phrasing is natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"flexibly respond to changes in priorities\" is slightly more concise than \"changes in work priorities,\" but still accurate. The phrase \"manages increasing workloads by reallocating existing staff\" is slightly more formal than \"coping with increasing workloads.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and natural. The use of \"excellent workforce\" is slightly more emphatic than \"competent,\" but still appropriate. The phrase \"handles the constantly increasing workload through redeployment of existing staff\" is slightly more formal than \"coping with increasing workloads.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"competent workforce\" is slightly more neutral than \"excellent,\" but still appropriate. The phrase \"manages increasing workloads by reallocating existing staff\" is slightly more formal than \"coping with increasing workloads.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"flexibly respond to changes in work priorities\" is slightly more precise than \"flexibly respond to changes in priorities.\"\n- The phrase \"maintaining a streamlined and flexible organizational structure\" is slightly more natural than \"maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure.\"\n- The phrase \"coping with increasing workloads\" is slightly more natural than \"managing increasing workloads\" or \"handles the constantly increasing workload.\"\n- The phrase \"through the reallocation of existing staff\" is slightly more natural than \"through redeployment of existing staff.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use the most natural and precise phrasing while maintaining the accuracy and fluency of the original translations.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA employs, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work priorities. The HKMA is part of the government structure, but hires staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined and flexible organizational structure and, as far as possible, implements new measures and copes with increasing workloads through the reallocation of existing staff.\n\n# Staffing Levels\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in vocabulary, fluency, and precision that can be refined for a more polished and natural English translation.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"regulatory regime\" for \"監管制度,\" adhering to the dictionary requirements.\n- The structure of the sentences is consistent, with all translations clearly indicating the timeline (beginning of 2016, second half of 2016, end of 2016) and the numerical changes in staffing.\n- The use of terms like \"staff strength,\" \"headcount,\" and \"staffing level\" is appropriate and commonly used in professional contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use slightly less fluent phrasing, such as \"fulfill the HKMA's supervisory functions\" (first translation) or \"fulfill its regulatory functions\" (fifth translation), which are correct but not as concise as \"fulfill the HKMA’s regulatory functions.\"\n- The phrase \"new insurance industry regulatory regime\" (first and sixth translations) is slightly wordy compared to \"new insurance regulatory regime\" (third and fifth translations), which is more concise and natural.\n- The use of \"Therefore\" in all translations is appropriate, but \"Consequently\" (second translation) offers a slight variation in tone that may be preferable in formal writing.\n**Improvements:**\n- Choose the most concise and natural phrasing for terms like \"staff strength\" or \"headcount.\" While all are acceptable, \"headcount\" is slightly more modern and commonly used in corporate or institutional contexts.\n- Use \"regulatory functions\" consistently, as it is the most direct and commonly used term in regulatory contexts.\n- Opt for \"new insurance regulatory regime\" over \"new insurance industry regulatory regime\" for brevity and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA's headcount was 875 at the beginning of 2016. Twelve positions were added in the second half of 2016 to fulfill the HKMA's regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Therefore, the HKMA's headcount reached 887 by the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot programs, and managing the increasingly complex and demanding workload, the HKMA’s overall staffing increased by 40 to 927 staff members in 2017 (a 4.5% increase). The newly created positions are responsible for carrying out the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:\n    - Enhancing supervisory capabilities to manage the growing technological risks in banks and new fintech initiatives, as well as addressing banks’ expansion within the region and their business operations;\n    - Strengthening regulatory and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the mutual evaluation program under the 2018 Financial Action Task Force;\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance to address the \"too big to fail\" issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Enhancing supervisory capabilities to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, and allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n- In response to the increased investment work involved in further promoting the diversification of Exchange Fund investment products, strengthening investment, risk management, and related support functions, while reinforcing strategic asset allocation and the investment process to address the increasingly challenging investment environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development plans, and enhancing relevant resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to meet market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and processing of monetary statistics, as well as allocating resources to handle inquiries and complaints related to licensing and designation of stored value facilities and retail payment systems, as well as related regulatory interface matters.\n\nTable 1 lists the HKMA’s establishment and actual staff numbers by department.  \nTable 1 shows the HKMA’s establishment and actual staff numbers as of January 1, 2017.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in word choice, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"lends staff\" and \"full-time or supportive operational assistance,\" which are natural expressions. It correctly uses \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board\" from the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version uses \"second staff\" and \"ad-hoc operational support,\" which are appropriate. It also correctly uses \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board.\" However, \"Financial Development Council\" is not in the dictionary, and the term \"second staff\" is slightly less common than \"lend\" or \"assign.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"Financial Stability Institute,\" which is not in the dictionary. It should be \"Financial Development Bureau\" as per the dictionary. The term \"supporting operational support\" is redundant and awkward.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses \"seconding staff\" and \"ad-hoc operational support,\" which are natural. It correctly uses \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board.\" However, \"Financial Development Authority\" is not in the dictionary, and the term \"is seconding staff\" is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"loans employees\" and \"supportive operational support,\" which are natural. It correctly uses \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board.\" However, \"Financial Development Bureau\" is not the most commonly used term in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very close to the first and is fluent and accurate. It uses \"lends staff\" and \"supportive operational assistance,\" which are natural. It correctly uses \"IMF\" and \"Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**: The best translation should use \"lend staff\" or \"assign staff\" as these are standard in official contexts. \"IMF\" is preferred over \"International Monetary Fund\" for brevity. \"Financial Development Bureau\" is the correct term from the dictionary. \"Full-time or supportive operational assistance\" is natural and clear. \"Seconding staff\" is also acceptable but slightly less common than \"lend\" or \"assign.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe HKMA allocates temporary resources to handle other tasks and lends staff to international or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Bureau, to provide assistance for work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA assigns staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or supportive operational assistance.\n\n# Remuneration Policies and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate, but the phrase \"seeks the opinions of its governance Sub-Committee through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" is slightly awkward. It should clarify that the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is the channel through which the governance sub-committee's opinions are sought. Also, \"basic benefits\" is a bit vague compared to \"basic welfare\" in the original.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"governance sub-committee\" and \"provident fund scheme.\" However, \"base salary\" is not the exact match for \"basic salary\" in the original, though it is a close synonym.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"receives advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters put forward by its governance Sub-Committee,\" which is a natural phrasing. It also correctly uses \"basic salary\" and \"variable pay.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"terms of service\" instead of \"service conditions,\" which is slightly less common in HR contexts.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"governance sub-committee\" and \"provident fund scheme\" correctly. However, \"paid in one lump sum annually\" is slightly more verbose than necessary. Also, \"his jurisdiction\" is not the best phrasing in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate, but it incorrectly places \"variable pay\" at the beginning of the sentence in the second paragraph, which changes the emphasis. Also, \"basic benefits\" is again vague and less precise than \"basic welfare.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"governance Sub-Committee\" and \"provident fund scheme\" correctly. The phrase \"taking into account market salary levels and practices\" is natural and accurate. However, \"awarded once a year\" is slightly less common than \"paid annually.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the exact dictionary terms where applicable. It should also maintain the original structure and nuance. Based on the above review, the third and sixth translations are the strongest, with the third being slightly more natural in phrasing and the sixth being more precise in its use of terms.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary receives advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters put forward by its governance Sub-Committee, and, with reference to market compensation levels and practices, determines the salary and terms of service for HKMA staff. The compensation package includes cash compensation and a provident fund scheme, as well as some basic benefits. Cash compensation includes a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and variable pay awarded annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"governance Sub-Committee\" with a capital \"S\" inconsistently and includes \"its\" which may imply the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (eFAC) has a governance sub-committee, which is not clearly stated in the original. It also uses \"its competitiveness\" which is slightly awkward.\n2. **Translation 2** is fluent and grammatically sound. It uses \"governance sub-committee\" with lowercase \"s\" and correctly uses \"FS\" and \"HKMA\" from the dictionary. However, \"seeking advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the performance of the governance sub-committee under their jurisdiction\" is slightly awkward in phrasing.\n3. **Translation 3** is well-structured and uses \"governance sub-committee\" consistently. It uses \"separately\" for \"特別調整,\" which is slightly less natural than \"special adjustments.\" It also uses \"financial sector\" instead of \"financial industry,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise.\n4. **Translation 4** correctly uses \"GSC\" and \"eFAC\" from the dictionary and is fluent. However, it uses \"consulting\" instead of \"consult\" and \"subject to special adjustments\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n5. **Translation 5** is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage, using \"GSC\" and \"eFAC\" with their full names. It is also the most fluent and natural in phrasing, with clear and concise sentences. It uses \"demonstrated outstanding performance\" which is more natural than \"outstanding work performance.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the original in structure and uses \"governance Sub-Committee\" with a capital \"S\" inconsistently. It also uses \"their salary competitiveness\" which is slightly awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of HKMA employees annually, seeking recommendations from the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (eFAC). The review considers the GSC's assessment of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey for the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. Special adjustments may also be made to the salaries of individual employees who have demonstrated outstanding performance, in order to maintain their salary competitiveness.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in terminology, phrasing, and fluency that affect the overall quality of the translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"HKMA,\" \"investment professionals,\" \"variable pay,\" and \"Financial Secretary.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key points about salary adjustments and approval processes are preserved.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"disbursement,\" \"lump sum,\" and \"remuneration\" to convey the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Deputy Chief Executive\" while others use \"Assistant Chief Executive.\" The original text uses \"助理總裁\" which is best translated as \"Assistant Chief Executive.\"\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward, such as \"the relevant employees will recuse themselves from discussions on proposals regarding their own remuneration at the meetings,\" which is unnecessarily wordy.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"governance Sub-Committee\" should be capitalized as \"Governance Sub-Committee\" for consistency with formal titles.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"adjustments to fixed salaries or disbursement of variable pay\" multiple times, which can be streamlined for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"Assistant Chief Executive\" consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Capitalize \"Governance Sub-Committee\" to reflect its formal status.\n- Use concise and natural phrasing, such as \"will not attend meetings discussing their own salary proposals\" instead of longer, more convoluted sentences.\n- Ensure that the term \"lump sum\" is used appropriately in the context of \"the total funds approved for salary payments.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe HKMA allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed salaries or disbursing variable pay based on the individual performance of each employee. The variable pay system for investment professionals is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed salaries or disbursement of variable pay for Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Sub-Committee, and the relevant employees will not attend meetings discussing their own salary proposals. For employees at the level of Division Head and below, adjustments to fixed salaries or disbursement of variable pay are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, based on authorization from the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the total funds approved for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation data for senior management in 2016.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual salary of employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual salary for the relevant position.  \n2. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of Senior Assistant Chief Executives includes the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation.  \n3. Other benefits include the provident fund scheme, medical and life insurance, and accumulated annual leave within the year. These benefits may vary depending on the service conditions of individual senior personnel.\n"}

獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"10年Plus同心展關懷標誌":["10 years plus Caring

Report to the Financial Secretary (FS)\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 149 to 237. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and the income and expenditure account, statement of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that these financial statements present fairly, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2016, and the financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinions\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six translations provided. All translations are generally accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nStrengths across all translations include:\n- Correct use of the dictionary terms: \"Chief Executive,\" \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" \"Audit Commission auditing standards,\" \"the Group,\" and \"audit evidence\" are all translated accurately.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved.\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- **Grammar and Fluency**: The first and second translations are the most fluent and grammatically precise. The third and fourth translations use \"Article 7\" instead of \"section 7,\" which is less common in legal English. The sixth translation uses \"directions\" instead of \"instructions,\" which is a minor but acceptable variation.\n- **Title of the Report Section**: The first and second translations use \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" and \"The Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements,\" respectively. These are both acceptable, but the second is slightly more formal and precise.\n- **Use of \"I believe\"**: All translations use \"I believe,\" which is appropriate in this context, as it reflects the auditor's professional judgment.\n- **\"Sufficient and appropriate\" vs. \"sufficient and appropriate to support\"**: The first and second translations use \"provide a basis for my audit opinion,\" while the fifth and sixth use \"support my audit opinion.\" Both are acceptable, but \"provide a basis for\" is more commonly used in audit reports.\nReasoning for improvements:\n- The best translation should use \"section 7\" rather than \"Article 7\" to align with legal terminology in English-speaking jurisdictions.\n- The title of the report section should be consistent with formal audit report language.\n- The use of \"instructions\" is more precise than \"directions\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"provide a basis for my audit opinion\" is more standard in audit reports than \"support my audit opinion.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the first and second translations, ensuring grammatical precision, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n---\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. The responsibilities I must assume under these standards are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities under these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters in auditing the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, but I did not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Director of Audit Report (Continued)  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original title, \"# 審計署署長報告（續）\", translates to \"Director of Audit Report (Continued)\" or similar variations. The dictionary specifies that \"審計署署長\" must be translated as \"Director of Audit,\" which all junior translators have correctly applied.  \nAmong the translations, the most fluent and natural options are \"Report by the Director of Audit (Continued)\" and \"Report of the Director of Audit (continued).\" These versions use more natural English phrasing for official reports. However, \"Director of Audit Report (Continued)\" is also acceptable and commonly used in formal contexts.  \nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in translations 4 and 6 is unnecessary unless the original formatting is to be preserved for stylistic or structural reasons. Since the original text includes the hashtag, it may be appropriate to retain it in the final translation.  \nThe word \"continued\" is typically capitalized in formal titles, so \"Continued\" is more appropriate than \"continued.\"  \n**Improved Translation:**  \n# Report by the Director of Audit (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle relevant matters during an audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 31,989.75 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 9,639.77 billion.\n\n95% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured at fair value, which is either quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs) for the same assets or liabilities, or estimated using valuation techniques, with the inputs based on observable market data (level 2 inputs).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and numerical formatting that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"fair value,\" \"valuation techniques\/methodologies,\" \"observable market data,\" \"level 3 inputs,\" and \"unlisted investment funds.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"level 3 inputs\" as a direct translation of \"第3級參數\" is appropriate and aligns with financial terminology.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical formatting:** There is inconsistency in the representation of the amount \"1,758.86億港元.\" Some translations use \"HKD 175.886 billion\" (incorrectly omitting the comma and misplacing the decimal), while others use \"HKD 1,758.86 billion\" (correct). The correct translation should be \"HKD 1,758.86 billion.\"\n- **Tense and verb choice:** Some translations use \"was estimated\" (past tense), while others use \"is estimated\" (present tense). The original text uses the past tense (\"是以估值方法估計\"), so \"was estimated\" is more accurate.\n- **Fluency and word choice:** The phrase \"primarily consisting of\" is more natural than \"mainly consisting of\" or \"primarily include.\" Also, \"totaled\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"amount to\" or \"is.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the numerical value is correctly formatted as \"HKD 1,758.86 billion.\"\n- Use the past tense \"was estimated\" to match the original text.\n- Use \"primarily consisting of\" for better fluency.\n- Use \"totaled\" for consistency with financial reporting language.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, with the parameters used not based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). These financial assets totaled HKD 1,758.86 billion, primarily consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including relevant monitoring procedures;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring procedures, including relevant application controls for computer systems;  \n- Obtaining external confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;  \n- If market quotations are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation techniques are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation techniques are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund Deposits\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 of the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of deposits in Fiscal Reserves were required to be repaid upon request, and interest was calculated at a fixed rate determined annually based on the past investment returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Future Fund\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The term \"Fiscal Reserves\" is consistently used, as required.\n- The term \"General Revenue Account\" is accurately translated in all versions.\n- The term \"Financial Secretary\" is used correctly, with some versions using the abbreviation \"FS\" (though it is not required).\n- The term \"composite rate\" is used correctly in all translations.\n- The term \"investment portfolio\" is used in most translations, with one using \"ip\" (which is not appropriate in this context).\n- The term \"long-term growth portfolio\" is used correctly in most translations, with one using \"ltgp\" (which is not appropriate in this context).\n- The term \"private equity\" and \"real estate investments\" are correctly used in all translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the balance of the Land Fund\" instead of \"the surplus of the Land Fund,\" which is less precise.\n- The second translation uses \"the surplus of the Land Fund\" correctly but says \"the amount determined by the Financial Secretary\" instead of \"the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary,\" which is slightly less precise.\n- The third translation uses \"the land Fund surplus\" with lowercase \"land,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Land Fund.\"\n- The fourth translation is the most accurate in terms of structure and clarity, but it uses \"the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary\" instead of \"the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary.\"\n- The fifth translation incorrectly uses \"ip\" instead of \"investment portfolio\" and uses \"permanent injection\" instead of \"regular contributions,\" which is inaccurate.\n- The sixth translation is very accurate, but it uses \"the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary\" instead of \"the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"surplus\" should be used for \"土地基金結餘\" (Land Fund surplus), not \"balance.\"\n- The term \"regular contributions\" is more appropriate than \"permanent injection\" for \"恆常注資.\"\n- The term \"investment portfolio\" should be used instead of \"ip.\"\n- The term \"long-term growth portfolio\" should be used instead of \"ltgp.\"\n- The phrase \"the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary\" is more appropriate than \"the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary\" in this context.\n- The phrase \"determined annually on a weighted average basis\" is more natural than \"determined annually using a weighted average.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe government established the Future Fund within the Fiscal Reserves on January 1, 2016. The deposits of the Future Fund include the initial capital from the surplus of the Land Fund (amounting to HKD 219.73 billion) and regular contributions transferred from the General Revenue Account (the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the deposits of the Future Fund is calculated based on a composite rate, which is determined annually on a weighted average basis, referencing the fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (which holds private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, together with the interest earned, should be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund had deposits totaling HKD 224.53 billion. The accumulated interest on these deposits amounted to HKD 10.071 billion. Due to the large amounts involved and significant changes in deposit terms, particular attention is required regarding the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of these deposits and the interest earned.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and precision that require attention.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"Future Fund\" as specified in the dictionary.\n- The term \"annual rate of return\" is consistently used where appropriate.\n- The term \"composite rate\" is used correctly in all translations.\n- The term \"interest accrued\" is used accurately in all translations.\n- The term \"long-term growth portfolio\" is used consistently, though some translations use \"long-term Growth portfolio\" with a capital \"G,\" which is not ideal for consistency.\n- The term \"investment portfolio\" is translated as either \"investment portfolio\" or \"ip,\" but \"ip\" is not standard in this context and should be avoided unless explicitly defined.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The use of \"ip\" as an abbreviation for \"investment portfolio\" is inconsistent and potentially confusing. It should be replaced with the full term.\n- Some translations use \"long-term Growth portfolio\" with a capital \"G,\" which is not necessary and may be considered stylistically inconsistent.\n- The phrase \"determined with reference to\" or \"based on the past performance\" is used in some translations, but \"determined based on\" or \"derived from\" is more natural in financial contexts.\n- The phrase \"reviewing the presentation and disclosure\" is used in some translations, which is correct, but \"presentation and disclosure\" should be hyphenated as \"presentation and disclosure\" or \"presentation and disclosure information\" for clarity.\n- Some translations use \"methodology\" or \"method used to calculate,\" which is acceptable, but \"calculation method\" is more direct and commonly used in audit contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"long-term growth portfolio\" without unnecessary capitalization.\n- Replace \"ip\" with \"investment portfolio\" to maintain clarity and professionalism.\n- Use \"derived from\" or \"based on\" consistently when referring to rates determined from past performance.\n- Use \"presentation and disclosure\" as a hyphenated term or with \"information\" for clarity.\n- Use \"calculation method\" or \"methodology\" depending on the context, but maintain consistency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe audit procedures for deposits in the Future Fund include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and the interest earned are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation method of the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate based on the historical performance of the investment portfolio, the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite rate derived from these two interest rates;\n- Verifying the amount of interest accrued calculated using the composite rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of the deposits and the interest earned in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original title, \"# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值,\" is a heading or subheading likely used in a financial or accounting document. The key terms are \"投資物業\" (investment properties) and \"公平值\" (fair value), both of which have exact translation requirements.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The investment properties, which are accounted for at fair value, are being valued.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"accounted for at fair value\" and \"investment properties.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The sentence structure is awkward and overly wordy for a title. It reads more like a full sentence than a heading.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct terms and follows a standard title format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Accounted for\" is slightly less common in financial terminology than \"carried at\" or \"measured at.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"measured at fair value,\" which is a standard term in IFRS.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The lowercase \"investment properties\" is inconsistent with the title format, which typically capitalizes all major words.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"# Valuation of Investment Properties Recorded at Fair Value\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Maintains the original hashtag and uses \"recorded at fair value.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Recorded at\" is not the most standard term in accounting for fair value measurement.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"carried at fair value,\" which is a standard and natural term in accounting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong, concise, and accurate translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"accounted for at fair value,\" which is correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Accounted for\" is slightly less natural than \"carried at\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\n\"Carried at fair value\" is the most natural and standard term used in accounting and financial reporting for assets measured at fair value. It is concise, grammatically correct, and aligns with common usage in IFRS and GAAP. The title should be capitalized consistently and avoid unnecessary words. The hashtag from the original is retained to maintain the format.\n**Final Translation:**\nValuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, numerical formatting, and phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. The use of \"amounting to\" is appropriate, and the term \"valuation methodologies\" is correctly used. However, the numerical formatting uses \"HKD 22.723 billion\" instead of \"HK$22.723 billion,\" which is less common in financial reporting.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"totaling\" and \"HK$22.723 billion,\" which are standard in financial contexts. The phrase \"which mainly engage in holding\" is natural and accurate. The use of \"valuation techniques\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear and professional.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has a critical error: it incorrectly translates \"227.23億港元\" as \"HKD 227.23 billion\" instead of \"HK$22.723 billion.\" This is a significant numerical error. Additionally, \"Principal activities\" is capitalized unnecessarily, which is not standard in English financial writing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is very similar to the second translation and is also strong. It uses \"totaling\" and \"HK$22.723 billion\" correctly. The only minor difference is the use of \"aggregate value\" instead of \"related interests valued at,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but slightly more verbose. The phrase \"carried at fair value\" is correct, but \"as at\" is less common than \"as of\" in financial reporting. The use of \"equity interests\" is slightly different from \"interests\" but still acceptable. The capitalization of \"Principal activities\" is again an issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong and accurate. It uses \"amounted to\" and \"HKD 22.723 billion,\" which is acceptable, though \"HK$\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. The phrase \"the principal activities of which are holding\" is natural and precise.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- **Numerical formatting**: \"HK$\" is more standard in financial reporting than \"HKD.\"\n- **Terminology**: \"valuation techniques\" and \"valuation methodologies\" are both acceptable, but \"valuation techniques\" is slightly more common in financial contexts.\n- **Capitalization**: \"Principal activities\" should not be capitalized unless it is a proper noun or title.\n- **Fluency and clarity**: \"totaling\" and \"aggregate value\" are more natural in financial writing than \"amounting to\" or \"related interests valued at.\"\n**Improved translation**:\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in 3 associates and 14 joint ventures, which primarily engage in holding overseas investment properties. The aggregate value of these interests is HK$32.083 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through associates or joint ventures, is primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation techniques and assumptions used.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and naturalness. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"measured at fair value\" which is appropriate. The term \"valuation methodologies\" is used consistently. However, \"valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports\" is slightly redundant.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"valuation techniques\" instead of \"valuation methodologies\" in the third bullet point. This is a minor variation and does not affect the overall meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation uses \"accounted for at fair value\" instead of \"measured at fair value,\" which is slightly less standard in financial reporting. It also uses \"valuer\" (singular) instead of \"valuers\" (plural), which is inconsistent with the rest of the text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"listed in the relevant reports\" instead of \"stated in the relevant valuation reports.\" This is a minor variation in wording but does not affect clarity.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"carried at fair value,\" which is also acceptable. It uses \"valuation techniques\" in the third bullet point, which is consistent with the dictionary. The use of \"as well as\" instead of \"and whether\" is slightly more natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation uses \"measured at fair value\" and \"valuation methodologies\" consistently. However, the phrase \"held by associates and joint ventures\" is slightly awkward compared to \"held by associates or joint ventures.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The phrase \"measured at fair value\" is the most standard and precise term in financial reporting.\n- \"Valuation methodologies\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts than \"valuation techniques.\"\n- The phrase \"held by associates or joint ventures\" is more natural and grammatically correct than \"held by associates and joint ventures.\"\n- The use of \"valuers\" (plural) is more appropriate in the context of audit procedures involving multiple professionals.\n- The phrase \"stated in the relevant valuation reports\" is more precise than \"listed in the relevant reports.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methodologies are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This information includes all the information in the 2016 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but excludes the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether that information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.\n\n# The original text is a formal title, and as such, the translation should reflect that tone and structure. All junior translators have correctly used the dictionary terms: \"金融管理專員\" as \"Monetary Authority\" and \"外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會\" as \"Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" However, there are variations in phrasing and grammatical structure that affect fluency and formality.\nTranslation 1 and 3 are very similar, with the only difference being the use of \"The\" at the beginning. Since the original is a title, it may be more appropriate to omit \"The\" for a more formal and concise structure.\nTranslation 2 and 4 use \"with respect to\" and \"in relation to,\" respectively, which are both grammatically correct and formal. However, \"regarding\" is more commonly used in formal titles and is more concise.\nTranslation 5 is nearly identical to Translation 2, but it omits \"The\" at the beginning, which may be preferable for a title.\nTranslation 6 uses \"bear responsibilities regarding the financial statements,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal and more conversational than the others.\nConsidering all these points, the best approach would be to use \"Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements.\" This version is concise, formal, and maintains the structure of the original title.\nResponsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical structure, and the use of specific terminology. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"must be responsible for\" which is slightly more formal than necessary, but still acceptable. The term \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" is capitalized correctly.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor variations in prepositions and verb forms. The use of \"directions\" instead of \"instructions\" is slightly less precise, though still acceptable. The term \"exchange Fund ordinance\" is not capitalized consistently.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"promulgated\" instead of \"issued,\" which is a more formal and appropriate term in legal contexts. The term \"exchange Fund ordinance\" is not capitalized consistently.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and accurate. It uses \"must also implement\" to separate the two responsibilities, which improves clarity. However, it omits the phrase \"that it considers necessary\" in the second part, which slightly weakens the connection between the internal controls and the Monetary Authority's judgment.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"must be responsible for\" and \"implementing internal controls that it considers necessary,\" which are both grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning clearly. The term \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" is capitalized correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the fifth, with the addition of \"(HKICPA)\" in parentheses, which is redundant since the full name was already used. It also uses \"deems necessary\" instead of \"considers necessary,\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The phrase \"must be responsible for\" is slightly more formal than necessary and can be simplified to \"is responsible for\" for better fluency.\n- The term \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" should be consistently capitalized.\n- The use of \"promulgated\" is more appropriate in a legal context than \"issued.\"\n- The phrase \"that it considers necessary\" is more natural than \"that it deems necessary.\"\n- The structure should clearly separate the two main responsibilities of the Monetary Authority.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the fifth and third translations, ensuring clarity, fluency, and proper legal terminology.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\nThe dictionary provides the following exact translations:  \n- **外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會**: ['Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee']  \n- **集團**: ['the Group']\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms, proper grammar, and natural phrasing.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 1.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: None. Identical to Translation 1.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Missing article \"The\" before \"Audit Sub-Committee,\" and \"supervising\" is less common than \"overseeing\" in formal contexts.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms and grammar.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"exchange\" should be capitalized as \"Exchange\" in \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of dictionary terms and grammar.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"exchange\" should be capitalized as \"Exchange.\"\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee of the exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 5.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same as Translation 5.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact dictionary terms.\n- Maintain proper grammar and article usage.\n- Use formal and natural English phrasing.\n- Ensure proper capitalization of proper nouns.\nTranslation 1 and 2 are the most accurate and natural, but they are identical. The only minor issue is that \"Exchange\" should be capitalized in \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Additionally, the possessive form \"Group’s\" is slightly more formal and appropriate in this context.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material misstatements if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to have ramifications on the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several observations can be made regarding their quality, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary terms. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms: \"Audit Commission,\" \"audit evidence,\" \"going concern,\" \"Monetary Authority,\" and \"the Group.\" However, there are variations in phrasing and fluency.\nThe first translation is accurate and fluent, but uses \"questioning mind\" instead of \"professional skepticism,\" which is slightly less precise in the context of auditing. The second translation uses \"professional skepticism\" correctly and is very close to the best version. The third translation is also strong, with a slightly more formal tone. The fourth and fifth translations are fluent but have minor issues with structure and flow, particularly in the fifth, where the sentences are run-on and lack proper punctuation. The sixth translation is very similar to the second and is also accurate and fluent.\nThe best elements from these translations include the use of \"professional skepticism,\" the correct use of \"going concern,\" and the accurate rendering of the audit procedures and responsibilities. The most fluent and precise translation is the second one, which uses \"professional skepticism\" and maintains a clear, professional tone throughout.\nBased on this review, the improved translation should incorporate the best elements from the most fluent and accurate translations, ensuring that the language is professional, precise, and adheres to the dictionary terms.\nFinal Translation:\nIn conducting the audit in accordance with the Audit Commission's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misstatements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failure to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failure to detect those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that there are material uncertainties, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit of the plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal control identified during the audit period.\n"}
