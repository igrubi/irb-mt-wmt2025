{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

translations provided by junior translators all capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and translate key terms such as “新冠” (novel coronavirus\/Covid-19), “疫情” (pandemic), “經濟” (economy), “失業率” (unemployment rate), and “行業” (sectors\/industries).\n- The phrase “第二年” is consistently translated as “second consecutive year,” which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The use of “hard-hit” for “重創” is accurate and natural in context.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses “anti-pandemic measures” for “打擊,” which is not a match for the dictionary options (e.g., “hit,” “battered,” “hard-hit”).\n- **Translation 3** uses “bringing economic activities almost to a standstill everywhere,” which is slightly wordy and less precise than “almost came to a standstill.”\n- **Translation 4** uses “aggregate local production value” instead of “local production total value” or “local GDP,” which is less standard in economic reporting.\n- **Translation 5** uses “local gross domestic product” (GDP), which is more precise than “local production total value” and aligns better with the term “本地生產總值.”\n- **Translation 6** uses “after 2019” for “繼...後,” which is acceptable but less formal than “following 2019.”\n**Improvements:**\n- Use “Covid-19” consistently for “新冠” as it is the most standard and widely recognized term.\n- Use “local GDP” for “本地生產總值” as it is the most accurate and commonly used term in economic contexts.\n- Use “following 2019” for “繼...後” to maintain a formal tone.\n- Ensure that “打擊” is translated as “impact” or “hit” rather than “anti-pandemic measures.”\n- Use “sectors” for “行業” as it is more general and appropriate in this context.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is concise and flows naturally in English.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic raged globally, catching the world off guard, and economic activities around the world almost came to a standstill. Under the pandemic's impact, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year following 2019, with local GDP recording the largest decline on record. The unemployment rate surged to a 16-year high, with some sectors particularly hard-hit.\n\nHowever, the translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of word choice, sentence structure, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"resilience\" and \"withstand\" correctly. However, \"Currency\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"we have consistently followed over the years\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"difficulties\" and \"withstood\" well. \"Have once again successfully withstood shocks\" is natural. \"Long-term adherence\" is slightly less precise than \"long-standing commitment.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: \"Difficulties are often times when our strength is demonstrated\" is slightly awkward. \"Monetary\" is a good choice for \"貨幣.\" \"Successfully withstood shocks once again\" is natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: \"Consistently implementing prudent policies over the years\" is slightly wordy but accurate. \"Have once again successfully withstood shocks\" is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: \"Adversity is often a time to demonstrate our strength\" is natural. \"Successfully withstood shocks again\" is slightly less formal than \"once again.\" \"Cautious policies\" is a valid synonym for \"prudent policies.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: \"Adversity often reveals our strengths\" is natural. \"Successfully withstood shocks once again\" is good. \"Consistently pursuing prudent policies\" is slightly less precise than \"adherence to.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"Adversity\" is a better fit for \"困境\" than \"difficulties.\"\n- \"Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector\" is more natural than \"Currency and banking sector\" with a capital \"C.\"\n- \"Withstood\" is the best choice for \"抵禦\" in this context.\n- \"Significant\" is the best fit for \"重重.\"\n- \"Prudent policies\" is more precise than \"cautious policies.\"\n- \"Consistently adhering to\" is more natural than \"consistently implementing\" or \"consistently pursuing.\"\n- \"Once again\" is more natural than \"again\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nHowever, adversity is often a time to demonstrate our strength. Despite facing significant challenges, Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector have once again successfully withstood shocks. This is by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently adhering to prudent policies over the years.\n\nThe original text discusses the uncertain path to economic recovery, highlighting factors such as monetary policy, vaccination progress, and geopolitical tensions. The junior translators have produced translations that are generally accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"ever-changing\" for \"變\" and places it awkwardly at the end of the sentence. Also, \"make the macroeconomic situation more ever-changing\" is grammatically incorrect and awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"still remains\" for \"仍\" and \"adding further uncertainties\" for \"更添變數.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, though \"still remains\" is slightly redundant.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"more variables\" for \"更添變數\" and \"ever-changing geopolitical tensions\" for \"地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, though \"macro situation\" is slightly informal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"add further variables\" for \"更添變數\" and \"ever-changing geopolitical tensions\" for \"地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷.\" The translation is fluent and accurate, with a natural tone.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"difficult to foresee as smooth\" for \"難望平坦,\" which is awkward. Also, \"adding more variables\" for \"更添變數\" is slightly less precise than \"add further variables.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"remains far from smooth\" for \"難望平坦,\" which is natural. Also, \"prolonged low-interest environment\" for \"長期低息環境\" is a good choice. The translation is fluent and accurate, with a professional tone.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"recovery\" for \"復甦\" and \"rebound\" as alternatives.\n- Use \"gone to great lengths to support\" for \"全力支持.\"\n- Use \"outlook\" for \"前景.\"\n- Use \"stance\" for \"立場.\"\n- Use \"impact\" for \"影響.\"\n- Use \"monetary\" for \"貨幣.\"\n- Use \"geopolitical\" for \"地緣.\"\n- Use \"progress\" for \"進展.\"\n- Use \"programme\" for \"計劃.\"\n- Use \"tensions\" for \"緊張.\"\n- Use \"policy\" for \"政策.\"\n- Use \"will not\" for \"難望.\"\n- Use \"long-term\" for \"長期.\"\n- Use \"vaccination\" for \"疫苗.\"\n- Use \"environment\" for \"環境.\"\n- Use \"add further variables\" for \"更添變數.\"\n- Use \"ever-changing\" for \"變.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe road to recovery will not be smooth. Even as central banks and governments around the world have gone to great lengths to support the economy, the outlook remains full of uncertainty, including the stance of central banks' monetary policies, the progress of vaccination programmes, and the potential impact of a long-term low-interest rate environment. On the other hand, ever-changing geopolitical tensions add further variables to the macroeconomic situation.\n\nEven though facing such an uncertain situation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to remain at its post, maintaining currency and financial stability, and creating a favorable environment for economic recovery. At the same time, under the continuously evolving banking and financial industry environment, we will also strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Currency and Financial Stability: As Steady as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the LERS has overcome one challenge after another, fully demonstrating its capacity to withstand shocks. Despite facing the pandemic and fluctuating macroeconomic environments, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side exchange guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times, resulting in cumulative inflows of approximately HK$383.5 billion.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" or \"LERS\" for \"聯匯制度.\"\n- Most translations use \"International Monetary Fund\" for \"國際貨幣基金組織.\"\n- The term \"資訊\" is consistently translated as \"information\" or \"data,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"穩健\" is translated as \"robust,\" \"sound,\" or \"resilient,\" which are all acceptable.\n- The term \"靈活\" is translated as \"flexible\" or \"agility,\" with \"flexible\" being more natural in context.\n- The term \"監察\" is translated as \"supervisory,\" \"monitoring,\" or \"oversight,\" with \"supervisory\" being the most accurate.\n- The term \"利用\" is translated as \"utilizes,\" \"uses,\" or \"leverages,\" with \"leverages\" being the most natural in context.\n- The term \"提升\" is translated as \"enhancing,\" \"enhance,\" or \"improve,\" with \"enhancing\" being the most natural.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"flexibly\" instead of \"flexible\" for \"靈活,\" which is grammatically incorrect in this context.\n- The term \"報告\" is translated as \"Report on External Doors\" in one translation, which is incorrect. It should be \"Report on the External Sector.\"\n- The term \"財政及\" is translated as \"financial discipline\" in some translations, which is correct, but not all translations use it consistently.\n- Some translations use \"Reserves\" with a capital \"R\" when it should be lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n- The term \"監管\" is sometimes translated as \"supervision\" or \"regulatory,\" which is acceptable, but \"regulatory\" is more precise in this context.\n- Some translations use \"flexibly operating economy\" instead of \"flexible economy,\" which is grammatically awkward.\n- The term \"應對\" is translated as \"respond to\" or \"coping with,\" which is correct, but not all translations use it consistently.\n- Some translations use \"monitoring ability\" instead of \"monitoring capability,\" which is less natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" consistently.\n- Use \"International Monetary Fund\" correctly.\n- Use \"financial discipline\" for \"財政及.\"\n- Use \"flexible\" for \"靈活.\"\n- Use \"supervisory\" for \"監察.\"\n- Use \"leverages\" for \"利用.\"\n- Use \"enhancing\" for \"提升.\"\n- Use \"respond to\" for \"應對.\"\n- Avoid grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n- Ensure consistency in terminology and style.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System has remained robust, thanks to the solid foundation established over the years. As summarized by the International Monetary Fund in its 2020 Report on the External Sector, the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System is based on operational rules with high transparency, ample financial and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation, a flexible economy, and prudent financial discipline. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly dispels rumors through close engagement with industry stakeholders and effective communication with the public via traditional and social media, while timely providing the latest information on facts and data. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also leverages the latest technology and data analysis techniques to continue enhancing its supervisory capabilities, flexibly responding to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic exerted significant pressure on the economy, the banking sector remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 20.7%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks was also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, the asset quality of banks slightly deteriorated, with the classified loan ratio rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020. However, it remained healthy and significantly lower than the long-term average level of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking Sector: The Lifeblood of the Economy\n\nThe banking sector plays a key financial intermediary role in the economy and society. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) focused on closely regulating banks' credit and liquidity risks, while also closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and taking a number of measures to ensure that the banking system can continue to provide essential services and offer loan support to the economy. In March, the HKMA lowered the countercyclical buffer capital ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it reduced the regulatory reserve levels. These measures collectively released about HK$100 billion in lending flexibility for the banking system.\n\nWe are fully aware that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face cash flow pressures in the current economic environment. Therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism established in 2019, introduced multiple relief measures, including the \"Pre-approved Interest Holiday without Principal Repayment\" scheme, which deferred the principal repayments of all eligible enterprises' loans for six months. As of the end of 2020, banks had approved more than 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures, involving over HK$740 billion. In view of the recurring pandemic, the HKMA extended the \"Pre-approved Interest Holiday without Principal Repayment\" scheme and extended the program until the end of October 2021 in March 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also introduced the \"100% Guaranteed Special Loan\" under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to help SMEs with their employees' salaries and rent payments. As of the end of 2020, more than 25,000 applications had been approved, involving approximately HK$40 billion. The scheme was optimized in the first quarter of 2021, and the application period was extended until December 31, 2021. During the year, banks also approved more than 28,000 relief measure applications, assisting individual customers with their cash flow, involving HK$44 billion. The banking sector has united to support businesses and individual customers, helping them overcome difficulties together, which is indeed encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the banking industry to strengthen financial inclusion and practice a \"customer-centric\" culture. We further encourage banks to pay special attention to customers in need and share good practices in various aspects, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more barrier-free and user-friendly banking services.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the operating environment of the banking industry has also changed sharply. Therefore, the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is not limited to addressing current challenges, but also needs to look ahead to the future, expanding the talent pool to support the future development of the banking industry. We have jointly launched a research program titled \"Enhancing the Professional Competencies of Future Banking Talent\" with the Hong Kong Bankers Association and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, to assess the potential talent gap in the banking industry over the next few years and to provide banks with a clear roadmap, in order to prepare in advance and improve the situation of talent availability. We have also launched the \"Banking Talent Launch Programme,\" offering recent graduates from local universities a six-month internship and specialized training related to the banking industry, in order to cultivate talent for the industry. Launching this program during a challenging period in Hong Kong's labor market also provides opportunities for young people who are interested in joining the banking industry.\n\n# International Financial Centre Status: Unfazed by Challenges\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. The first, third, and fourth translations correctly use \"International Financial Centre Status\" and \"Unafraid of Challenges\" or \"No Fear of Challenges,\" which are all acceptable. However, \"Unfazed by Challenges\" from the sixth translation is more idiomatic and natural in English, conveying a sense of calm confidence in the face of difficulties.\nThe second translation, \"International financial centre status: undaunted by challenges,\" is also fluent and grammatically correct, though \"undaunted\" is slightly less common than \"unfazed\" in this context. The fifth translation, \"International financial centre status: no challenges,\" is incorrect because it misrepresents the original meaning, which is about not being afraid of challenges, not the absence of challenges.\nThe best translation should use \"International Financial Centre Status\" with a capital \"F\" in \"Financial\" as it is a proper noun referring to a specific entity. \"Unfazed by Challenges\" is the most natural and idiomatic choice, effectively conveying the intended meaning of remaining calm and confident in the face of challenges.\nInternational Financial Centre Status: Unfazed by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the key functions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is to assist in consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre, our future planning covers the banking sector as well as the entire financial system, aiming to enable Hong Kong to maintain its competitiveness as an international financial centre in an ever-changing financial environment. During the pandemic, we have continued to steadily advance these efforts, actively exploring new opportunities in several key areas to fully capitalise on the opportunities presented by new trends and changes.\n\n# Promote Green Finance, Creating a More Sustainable Future\n\nThe first junior translator's translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. However, \"carried out in three phases\" is slightly awkward. The second junior translator uses \"three-phase initiative\" and \"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,\" which are more precise. The third junior translator uses \"implemented in three phases\" and \"Climate-related Financial Disclosures Working Group,\" which are accurate. The fourth junior translator uses \"launching three-phase measures\" and \"developing a regulatory framework,\" which are natural. The fifth junior translator uses \"rolled out in May 2019 in three phases\" and \"Climate-related Financial Disclosure Working Group,\" which are accurate. The sixth junior translator has some grammatical errors, such as \"actively engages in Phase II work\" and \"committed to by 2025.\"\nThe best translation should use \"launched\" for \"推出,\" \"three-phase measures\" for \"分三階段進行的措施,\" \"Green Benchmark\" for \"「綠色基準」,\" \"regulatory framework\" for \"監管架構,\" and \"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\" for \"氣候相關財務披露工作小組.\" It should also use \"make Hong Kong the first region in Asia\" for \"使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區.\"\nThe best possible translation is:\nThe first area is promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of three-phase measures in May 2019, related work has made ideal progress. In 2020, we completed the \"Green Benchmark\" assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued a notice providing guidance on banks managing climate risks and sharing experiences. We are also actively advancing the second phase of work, formulating a regulatory framework for the banking industry to manage climate risks. Furthermore, we are committed to requiring banks to disclose climate-related information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures by 2025 or earlier. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to implement such specific requirements.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)’s integration of ESG factors into its investment processes and its active engagement in ESG investments. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"globally\" appropriately. It correctly uses \"consciously make ESG investments\" and \"low-carbon projects.\" However, it omits the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) initially, which may be less formal than required.\n- **Translation 2** is well-structured and includes the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" upfront, which is more formal and appropriate for official contexts. It uses \"practice ESG investing\" which is slightly less precise than \"make ESG investments\" or \"adopt ESG investments.\"\n- **Translation 3** is fluent and accurate, using \"overseeing\" instead of \"monitoring,\" which is a valid synonym. However, \"actively implement ESG investments\" is slightly awkward compared to \"make ESG investments.\"\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Reserves\" with a capital \"R,\" which is incorrect unless referring to a specific entity. It also uses \"Green\" with a capital \"G,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"green\" or \"Green\" (lowercase is more common in this context). The use of \"community\" instead of \"social\" is a deviation from the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly capitalizes \"Reserves\" and \"Managers,\" which is not standard in this context. It also uses \"community\" instead of \"social,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary. The phrase \"adopt ESG investment\" is grammatically awkward and should be \"adopt ESG investments.\"\n- **Translation 6** is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"globally\" appropriately. It correctly uses \"consciously make ESG investments\" and \"low-carbon projects.\" However, it omits the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" initially, which may be less formal than required.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) initially for formality.\n- Use \"HKMA\" in subsequent mentions for brevity.\n- Use \"globally\" or \"world’s largest\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"green\" (lowercase) and \"Green\" (capitalized if referring to a specific entity, which is not the case here).\n- Use \"social\" as per the dictionary, not \"community.\"\n- Use \"make ESG investments\" or \"adopt ESG investments\" as appropriate.\n- Ensure consistency in capitalization and terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as one of the world’s largest reserve managers, actively incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the procedures for selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. We also consciously make ESG investments, including investments in green, social, and sustainable bonds and low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong's green financial ecosystem, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been assisting the government in issuing green bonds. The recently issued second batch of government green bonds has been even more popular among international investors. Capitalizing on this development trend, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021-22 Annual Budget that the government will expand the scale of the \"Government Green Bond Programme,\" doubling the borrowing cap to HK$200 billion and increasing the types and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, one component of our overall strategy is to collaborate with local regulatory institutions and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with other regulatory institutions, has established a cross-agency Steering Group for green and sustainable finance to coordinate relevant measures within the financial sector. The group has already formulated a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has become a founding member and the first regional executive director of the Asia region in the Green Banking Alliance, working together to advance the initiative. The alliance aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting from Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the aforementioned work to help reduce climate-related risks facing the financial industry, and to promote local banks to leverage their strengths in meeting the substantial funding demands for green investments in the region.\nWe expect the aforementioned work to help reduce climate-related risks facing the financial industry, and to promote local banks to leverage their strengths in meeting the substantial funding demands for green investments in the region.\n\n# Fintech Provides Convenience to the Public and Benefits the Economy\n\nAnother major engine driving growth in the financial industry is fintech, and under the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace in this area has further accelerated.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key term \"轉數快\" as \"FPS\" (Faster Payment System), which is consistent with the dictionary.\n- The term \"新冠\" is consistently translated as \"COVID-19,\" which is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"電子支付渠道\" is translated as \"electronic payment channels,\" which is accurate and natural.\n- The term \"平均每日交易量\" is translated as \"average daily transaction volume,\" which is correct and fluent.\n- The use of \"the public\" for \"公眾\" is consistent and natural.\n- The term \"政府\" is translated as \"government\" or \"Government,\" which is appropriate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations repeat the full name \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" unnecessarily, which is redundant and affects readability.\n- The phrase \"causing the average daily transaction volume... to surge by 2.3 times\" is grammatically awkward in some translations.\n- The use of \"had registered\" in one translation is incorrect in tense.\n- Some translations use \"pay for more types of government and public service accounts,\" which is slightly off in meaning compared to the original \"繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單\" (pay for more types of government and public service bills).\n- The phrase \"a role unprecedented\" in one translation is ungrammatical and should be \"an unprecedented role.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"FPS\" consistently without repeating the full name unless necessary.\n- Ensure correct verb tenses, especially for past actions.\n- Use \"bills\" instead of \"accounts\" for \"帳單\" to maintain accuracy.\n- Use natural phrasing such as \"surged by 2.3 times\" or \"increased by 2.3 times\" for clarity.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"average daily transaction volume\" is used correctly and consistently.\nBased on this review, here is the improved translation:\nThe past year has clearly shown that fintech can expand our \"toolkit\" to deal with unexpected shocks. Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. From its launch in September 2018 to the end of 2020, the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" has recorded 6.9 million registered accounts. Even under the restrictions of social distancing measures, the public could still use FPS, a secure, fast, and reliable way, to make payments and transfer funds, leading to a significant increase of 2.3 times in the average daily transaction volume of FPS in 2020. We have also continued to collaborate with the government to expand the application scope of FPS to cover payment of a wider range of government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, fintech helps banks provide more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have already opened in Hong Kong this year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, totaling HK$15 billion in customer deposits. Some virtual banks have already started using new types of data for credit assessment, aiming to open up new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the development of a more extensive and diversified regulatory technology ecosystem in Hong Kong, as part of the \"eTradeConnect\" initiative, in order to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to publishing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of the application of regulatory technology, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also released a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of regulatory technology in the banking sector. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the \"Commercial Data Connect\" project to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to more conveniently obtain bank financing by utilizing their own digital footprints.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and use the term \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0\" (CFI 2.0) as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"HKMA\" is consistently used, which is appropriate.\n- The phrase \"enhance banks' cybersecurity capabilities\" is well-received and appears in multiple translations.\n- The use of \"regulatory technology\" and \"anti-money laundering\" is accurate and aligns with the dictionary.\n- The translations generally maintain the formal tone appropriate for a regulatory authority.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"inclusion\" or \"inclusive\" for \"普及\" (popularization), which is not the best fit. \"Widespread\" or \"increasingly widespread\" would be more accurate.\n- The term \"成效\" (effectiveness) is translated as \"effectiveness\" in most translations, which is correct, but \"impact\" or \"success\" are also valid and should be considered for context.\n- \"加強\" (strengthen) is translated consistently, but \"step up\" or \"stepped up\" could be used for variety.\n- \"現場審查\" (on-site review) is translated as \"on-site reviews\" in most translations, which is correct.\n- \"三年\" (three-year) is translated as \"three-year\" in all translations, which is accurate.\n- \"數據\" (data) is translated as \"data\" in all translations, which is correct.\n- \"反洗錢\" (anti-money laundering) is translated correctly in all translations.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"increasingly widespread\" for \"日趨普及\" instead of \"inclusive\" or \"inclusion.\"\n- Use \"effectiveness\" for \"成效\" as it is the most natural and precise term in this context.\n- Use \"enhance\" or \"improve\" for \"提升\" depending on context.\n- Use \"regulatory framework\" for \"制定監管框架\" as it is the most natural term.\n- Use \"credit risk\" for \"信用風險\" as it is the most precise term.\n- Use \"innovative credit risk assessment methods\" for \"創新信用風險評估方法\" as it is the most accurate and natural phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe fintech landscape is evolving rapidly, with technological applications becoming increasingly widespread. The HKMA must continue to uphold rigorous regulation. To this end, we have launched the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0\" (CFI 2.0) to enhance banks' cybersecurity capabilities. We have also strengthened on-site reviews of technology risk management and developed a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of individual loan products that utilize innovative credit risk assessment methods. The HKMA has also initiated a three-year plan focused on the application of regulatory technology to enhance the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes. The work currently underway includes more effectively utilizing data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering regulations.\n"}

銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局在密切留意疫情對銀行營運影響的同時，繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險管理。鑑於網絡風險持續增加以及業界加快採用科技，金管局加強對銀行科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管，以及數碼金融服務消費者的保障。\n\n金管局給予銀行彈性，以便銀行在疫情下能繼續為客戶提供服務。金管局又聯同其他有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的實施細則，以及就家族辦公室及財富管理業務提供指引。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助銀行更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎管理持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局亦繼續推動公私營夥伴共享訊息，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。\n\n年內推出多項加強銀行體系監管制度的新規則及規例，以符合最新的國際標準。在綠色及可持續銀行業方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管要求。金管局亦致力制定處置標準、進行處置規劃及建立處置執行能力，確保香港備有具公信力的銀行處置機制。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局繼續推動金融科技生態圈的發展，其中銀行及支付業界日益採用金融科技。快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。金管局積極參與央行數碼貨幣等範疇的跨境合作。\n\n香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位穩固，並繼續作為進入中國內地的主要門戶。香港與內地的金融聯繫繼續透過其世界級市場基建以及互聯互通機制而更趨緊密。年內在粵港澳大灣區發展方面亦取得良好進展。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理企業財資中心，以及綠色與可持續金融範疇的競爭力。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境複雜多變，外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%，而且5個主要投資類別均錄得正回報。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動負責任投資及資產多元化。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為13.7%。\n\n# 機構職能及社會責任\n\n年內金管局繼續透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持有效溝通，增進公眾對金管局政策及運作的了解。金管局在執行職務時，秉持極高的企業管治水平，支持員工提升專業能力、嚴格控制財政及加強資訊科技能力與保安，以應對新挑戰及項目，以及日益繁重的工作。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力履行機構社會責任，力求成為負責任及可持續發展的機構。在新冠病毒疫情下，金管局作出特別工作安排，確保重要職能繼續正常運作，並同時保障員工健康。金管局又推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，以減輕疫情造成的不利影響。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

the novel coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong's economy recorded its largest contraction on record in 2020, with consumption and tourism-related sectors particularly hard-hit. The labor market sharply deteriorated, while inflation moderated. To address the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced relief measures to support the economy.\nFacing the novel coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong's economy recorded its largest contraction on record in 2020, with consumption and tourism-related sectors particularly hard-hit. The labor market sharply deteriorated, while inflation moderated. To address the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite facing significant challenges, Hong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient, with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality stays at a healthy level.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect the overall tone and precision of the translations. Here is a critical evaluation of each:\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilient\" for \"穩健,\" which is appropriate, and \"sound financial conditions\" for \"財務狀況良好.\" The use of \"stays at a healthy level\" for \"仍處於穩健水平\" is natural and idiomatic in English.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is also strong. It uses \"financial conditions remaining healthy\" and \"deposits continuing to grow,\" which are both natural. However, \"solid levels\" for \"穩健水平\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"healthy level.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is fluent but uses \"sound\" for \"穩健\" and \"good financial conditions\" for \"財務狀況良好.\" While correct, \"good\" is less formal than \"sound\" or \"healthy\" in a financial context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This version is very close to the best possible translation. It uses \"resilient,\" \"sound financial conditions,\" and \"healthy levels.\" However, \"Financial\" is capitalized unnecessarily in \"Financial conditions.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but uses \"solid\" for \"穩健\" and \"continues to stay at a solid level\" for \"仍處於穩健水平.\" The repetition of \"solid\" and \"stays\" is slightly redundant and less elegant than \"stays at a healthy level.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This version has a grammatical error: \"deposits continue to grow\" should be \"deposits continue to grow\" (not \"deposits continue to grow\" with a missing subject). Also, \"stays strong\" for \"充裕\" is not the best fit, as \"strong\" is more commonly used for \"capital\" than for \"liquidity.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nDespite facing significant challenges, Hong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient, with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality stays at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the pandemic increasing uncertainty factors, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency markets operated smoothly and orderly, reflecting the robustness of Hong Kong's monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was strong throughout most of 2020, with the strong-side exchange guarantee being triggered multiple times. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the Linked Exchange Rate System and the market's confidence in the system.\n\n# Banking Sector Stability\nThe original text is \"# 銀行體系穩定,\" which translates to \"Banking Sector Stability\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The junior translators have produced several versions of this translation, with the most common being \"banking sector stability\" and \"Banking Sector Stability.\" \nThe first junior translator used all lowercase: \"banking sector stability.\" While this is grammatically correct, it lacks the formality and emphasis that might be appropriate for a title or heading.\nThe second junior translator used title case: \"Banking Sector Stability.\" This is a strong option, especially if the text is intended as a heading or title, as it follows standard title capitalization rules and emphasizes the key terms.\nThe third junior translator used a format with a hashtag and a full phrase: \"# Stability of the Banking Sector.\" This format is more suitable for social media or informal contexts and may not be appropriate for formal or academic writing.\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth junior translators all used \"banking sector stability,\" which is a correct and natural translation but lacks the title-like structure that might be appropriate for the original text's format.\nConsidering these options, the best translation would be \"Banking Sector Stability,\" as it maintains the correct terminology from the dictionary, uses proper title case, and is concise and natural in English. It also aligns with the structure of the original text, which includes a hashtag and a heading-like phrase.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"stepped up adoption\" and \"protection of consumers of digital financial services.\" However, \"supervisory management\" is slightly awkward and could be more natural as \"supervision of risk management.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very strong, with natural phrasing and correct use of terms like \"operational resilience\" and \"stepped up.\" The structure is clear and the grammar is sound. It also uses \"continued increase\" which is a good match for \"持續增加.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also strong, with accurate use of \"sustained increase\" and \"technological risk management.\" However, \"regulating banks' credit and liquidity risk management\" is slightly awkward; \"supervision of credit and liquidity risk management\" would be more natural.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"operational soundness\" and \"strengthened supervision,\" which are appropriate. However, \"the HKMA has strengthened supervision over banks' technology risk management\" could be more precise by using \"regulatory oversight\" as in the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is clear and accurate, with good use of \"soundness of their operations\" and \"accelerated adoption.\" However, the structure \"continues to focus on monitoring credit and liquidity risk management\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version has a grammatical error: \"while closely monitor\" should be \"while closely monitoring.\" Also, \"protection for consumer\" should be \"protection for consumers.\" The use of \"will strengthen\" is less precise than \"has strengthened\" or \"strengthens.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should avoid awkward phrasing and maintain the formal tone appropriate for a regulatory authority. The use of \"regulatory oversight\" and \"operational resilience\" is particularly strong, as is the structure that clearly separates the two main actions of the HKMA: monitoring the pandemic's impact and focusing on risk management.\n**Improved Translation**:\nWhile the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on banking operations, it remains focused on the regulatory oversight of banks' credit and liquidity risk management. Given the continued increase in cyber risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the Authority has strengthened its regulatory oversight of banks' technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as the protection of consumers of digital financial services.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides banks with flexibilities to enable them to continue providing services to customers during the pandemic. The HKMA also worked together with other relevant authorities to formulate the implementation details of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program, as well as to provide guidance on family office and wealth management activities.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help banks more effectively respond to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA also continues to promote public-private partnerships in sharing information and supports the banking industry in adopting compliance technology.\n\nWithin the year, a number of new rules and regulations to strengthen the banking sector’s regulatory regime will be introduced to comply with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has entered Phase II of a three-phase plan and is formulating relevant regulatory requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also committed to developing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and establishing resolution execution capabilities to ensure Hong Kong has a credible banking resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\nThe original text is a concise title, and the goal is to convey the idea that Hong Kong holds a significant position in the global financial landscape. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the key terms, and the junior translators have produced variations that are mostly accurate but differ in style and fluency.\nTranslation 1: \"Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre\" is grammatically correct and fluent. It uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"international financial centre\" for \"金融中心,\" which are both appropriate choices.\nTranslation 2: \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status\" is also grammatically correct but slightly less natural in English. While it is understandable, the phrase \"financial centre status\" is less commonly used than \"status as a financial centre.\"\nTranslation 3: \"# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\" includes a hashtag, which is not appropriate for a formal title. Additionally, \"International\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"Status\" is capitalized as if it were a title, which is inconsistent with standard English title case.\nTranslation 4: \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre position\" uses \"position\" for \"地位,\" which is a valid translation but less common in this context. \"Position\" can imply a more temporary or less established role, whereas \"status\" or \"role\" might be more appropriate.\nTranslation 5: \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\" is well-structured and uses title case appropriately. It is very similar to Translation 1 but with \"Status\" capitalized, which is acceptable for a title.\nTranslation 6: \"Hong Kong’s International financial centre status\" has a lowercase \"financial,\" which is a minor error. It also uses \"status\" for \"地位,\" which is acceptable but slightly less natural than \"status as.\"\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use natural English phrasing. \"Status\" is a more natural choice for \"地位\" in this context, and \"international financial centre\" is the most accurate and commonly used translation for \"金融中心.\" The use of title case is appropriate for a heading, and the hashtag should be omitted.\nTherefore, the improved translation is:\nHong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be unclear. The phrase \"among banks and payment industry stakeholders increasingly adopting fintech\" is awkwardly structured. The term \"cross-boundary\" is used instead of \"cross-border,\" which is less standard in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and \"cross-border.\" The phrase \"with banks and the payment industry increasingly adopting fintech\" is fluent and accurate. This translation is strong and adheres well to the dictionary terms.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"HKMA\" and \"cross-border\" correctly. However, the phrase \"among which banks and payment industry stakeholders are increasingly adopting fintech\" is slightly awkward and less direct than the second translation.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"cross-border\" correctly. However, the phrase \"Faster Payment System 'Faster Payment System'\" is redundant and unnecessary. The term \"fast payment system\" is not the exact match for the dictionary term \"快速支付系統,\" which should be \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"financial technology ecosystem\" and \"financial technology\" instead of \"fintech,\" which is less concise. The phrase \"fast payment system 'FPS' (Faster Payment System)\" is redundant and awkwardly structured.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"HKMA,\" \"cross-border,\" and \"Faster Payment System 'FPS'\" correctly. The structure is clear and natural, and it adheres closely to the dictionary terms.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and specificity.\n- \"金融科技生態圈\" should be \"fintech ecosystem\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"銀行及支付業界\" should be \"banks and the payment industry.\"\n- \"快速支付系統「轉數快」\" should be \"Faster Payment System 'FPS'\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"跨境合作\" should be \"cross-border cooperation.\"\n- \"央行數碼貨幣\" should be \"central bank digital currency.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be a refined version of the sixth junior translator's work, with minor adjustments for clarity and fluency.\n**Final Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with banks and the payment industry increasingly adopting fintech. Transactions on the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" have seen significant growth. The HKMA actively participates in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currency.\n\nHong Kong's position as a global offshore renminbi business hub remains robust, and it continues to serve as the main gateway to Mainland China. Hong Kong's financial links with the Mainland continue to grow closer through its world-class financial market infrastructure and the Connect schemes. Good progress has also been made in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area this year.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to open up new opportunities and enhance Hong Kong's financial platform, particularly in the areas of asset and wealth management, treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, which must be adhered to.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"further\" for \"一步\" and \"competitiveness\" for \"競爭力.\" However, \"financial platform\" is a direct translation of \"金融平台,\" which may not be the most natural phrasing in English. Also, \"treasury centres\" is correct, but \"areas of green and sustainable finance\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is fluent and uses \"hub\" for \"中心,\" which is appropriate. \"Green and sustainability finance areas\" is slightly awkward, but the overall structure is good. However, \"Green\" with a capital \"G\" may not be necessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is less accurate. It omits \"財資\" (treasury) and incorrectly places \"the treasury center\" as a separate entity. Also, \"enhance the Hong Kong financial platform\" is awkwardly phrased.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is problematic. It incorrectly uses \"Payments regulator\" for \"金管局\" (HKMA), which is not accurate. Also, \"asset and treasury management enterprises\" misrepresents the original meaning.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"further enhancing\" and \"competitiveness in the areas of green and sustainable finance.\" However, \"the treasury centre\" is slightly awkwardly placed.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but misplaces \"the competitiveness of asset and wealth management enterprises' treasury centres,\" which changes the intended meaning. The original text refers to enhancing the platform, not the competitiveness of the enterprises themselves.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, use natural English phrasing, and adhere to the dictionary terms. It should avoid awkward constructions and ensure that the structure clearly conveys the HKMA's efforts to enhance Hong Kong's financial platform in specific areas.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively opening up new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong's financial platform, including asset and wealth management enterprises' treasury centres, as well as the competitiveness in the areas of green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the complex and uncertain investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$2,358 billion in investment income in 2020, with a return rate of 5.3%, and all five major investment categories recorded positive returns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to commit to promoting responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions and Corporate Social Responsibility\nThe original title \"機構職能及社會責任\" requires careful translation to maintain both formality and clarity. The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first translation, \"Functions of Institutions and Social Responsibility,\" is grammatically correct but lacks the formal tone appropriate for an institutional document. It also uses \"Social Responsibility\" in lowercase, which may not convey the intended emphasis.\nThe second translation, \"# Institutional Functions and Social Responsibility,\" correctly capitalizes \"Institutional\" and uses a hashtag, which may be appropriate if the text is part of a digital or online document. However, the hashtag is not necessary in a formal title.\nThe third translation, \"Functions and social responsibility,\" is too informal and lacks the necessary capitalization and structure for a formal title.\nThe fourth translation, \"Institution Functions and Social Responsibility,\" incorrectly uses \"Institution\" as a noun without an article and fails to capitalize \"Functions\" appropriately.\nThe fifth translation, \"Functions and social responsibility of institutions,\" is grammatically correct but places the noun \"institutions\" at the end, which may not be the most effective structure for a title.\nThe sixth translation, \"Institutions' Functions and Social Responsibility,\" correctly uses the possessive form but may be slightly more complex than necessary for a title.\nConsidering these options, the best approach is to use a title that is both formal and clear, with proper capitalization and structure. \"Institutional Functions and Corporate Social Responsibility\" effectively captures the meaning of the original title, using \"Institutional\" to denote the nature of the functions and \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" to emphasize the organizational aspect of social responsibility. This choice aligns with the dictionary entries provided and maintains the appropriate tone for an institutional document.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations. When executing its duties, the HKMA upholds a high level of corporate governance, supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling financial discipline, and strengthening information technology capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as increasingly complex work.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to commit to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, striving to become a responsible and sustainable institution. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made special work arrangements to ensure key functions continue to operate normally while also safeguarding the health of its staff. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also introduced various measures to support individuals and businesses in need, in order to mitigate the adverse impacts caused by the pandemic.\n"}

9\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that it would reduce the issuance of HK$20 billion in Exchange Fund Bills to increase overall Hong Kong dollar liquidity in the interbank market, and help ensure the smooth operation of the Hong Kong dollar interbank market amid the volatility brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic on the global macroeconomic environment.\n\n# April 22\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) establishing a temporary USD liquidity arrangement to support licensed banks and ease liquidity strains in the global USD interbank market. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Translation 1** uses \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying \"Hong Kong,\" which may be imprecise. It also uses \"help relief the liquidity strain,\" which is grammatically awkward.\n**Translation 2** is more precise by naming \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"alleviating the liquidity shortage situation,\" which is fluent and accurate. However, it omits \"interbank\" in \"interbank market,\" which is important for clarity.\n**Translation 3** uses \"facility\" instead of \"arrangement,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this context. It also uses \"moderate the liquidity strain,\" which is less idiomatic than \"alleviate\" or \"ease.\"\n**Translation 4** correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"USD\" and includes \"interbank lending market,\" which is more specific. However, \"tightness\" is less common than \"shortage\" or \"crunch\" in financial contexts.\n**Translation 5** is very close to the best version, using \"launch\" instead of \"establishment,\" which is acceptable. It also includes \"interbank lending market\" and uses \"alleviating the liquidity shortage situation,\" which is accurate.\n**Translation 6** uses \"crunch\" for \"shortage,\" which is idiomatic in financial contexts. It also uses \"HKMA\" and \"USD\" correctly and includes \"interbank market.\"\n**Improvements to consider:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n- Use \"USD\" or \"US dollars\" consistently.\n- Use \"interbank lending market\" for specificity.\n- Use \"alleviate\" or \"ease\" for \"緩\" and \"紓.\"\n- Use \"arrangement\" for \"安排\" as it is more precise in this context.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and fluency.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announces the establishment of a temporary USD liquidity arrangement to provide USD liquidity support and assist in alleviating the liquidity shortage situation in the global USD interbank lending market.\n\n# October 23rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as primary liquidity providers for Hong Kong's offshore renminbi market.\n\n# November 25\n# 11月25日\nThe original text is a simple date: \"11月25日,\" which translates to \"November 25th\" in English. The dictionary provides translations for the components of the date: \"月\" as \"month,\" \"25\" as \"25\" or \"twenty-five,\" and \"1\" as \"1\" or \"one.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"November 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted the ordinal \"th\" which is commonly used in English for dates. However, in many contexts, especially in headlines or lists, the \"th\" is often omitted for brevity.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correctly used \"November\" (derived from \"11月\") and \"25\" (from the dictionary).\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# November 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Maintained the original formatting with the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is not standard in English date formatting and may be unnecessary unless the context requires it.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correctly used \"November\" and \"25.\"\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"November 25th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Fully correct in terms of grammar and usage. The ordinal \"th\" is appropriate in formal writing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly more verbose than necessary in some contexts.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correctly used \"November\" and \"25.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"November 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"November 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first and fourth translations.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first and fourth translations.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# November 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the second translation.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nWhile all translations are technically correct, the most natural and widely accepted format in English is \"November 25th.\" It includes the ordinal \"th,\" which is standard in formal writing. However, in informal or concise contexts, \"November 25\" is also acceptable. Since the original text is a simple date without any additional context, the most neutral and universally appropriate translation would be \"November 25th.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nNovember 25th\n\nThe original text discusses the renewal and expansion of a currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The junior translators have produced several versions, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Translation 1** correctly uses \"People's Bank of China (People's Bank)\" and \"publicly announced,\" but incorrectly translates \"4,000億元人民幣\" as \"4,000 billion yuan\" instead of \"400 billion yuan.\" It also misrepresents \"4,700億港元\" as \"470 billion HKD\" instead of \"470 billion HK$.\"\n**Translation 2** uses \"PBOC\" and \"five-year currency swap agreement\" correctly, but again misrepresents the numerical values as \"400 billion yuan (HK$47 billion)\" and \"500 billion yuan (HK$59 billion),\" which are off by a factor of ten.\n**Translation 3** is more accurate in terms of numerical values, using \"400 billion yuan (470 billion Hong Kong dollars)\" and \"500 billion yuan (590 billion Hong Kong dollars).\" It also correctly identifies the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as \"HKMA.\" However, it omits the parenthetical \"(PBOC)\" after \"People's Bank of China.\"\n**Translation 4** is very close to the correct version, using \"PBOC,\" \"HKMA,\" and the correct numerical values. It also uses \"RMB\" and \"HK$\" appropriately. However, it omits the parenthetical \"(PBOC)\" after \"People's Bank of China.\"\n**Translation 5** is accurate in terms of numerical values and uses \"renminbi\" and \"HK$\" correctly. It also includes the parenthetical \"(PBOC)\" after \"People's Bank of China.\" However, it uses \"China’s People’s bank\" instead of \"China’s People’s Bank of China,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Translation 6** has significant grammatical errors, including \"announces has been renewed to a 5 year currency swap agreement,\" and incorrectly translates \"4,000億元人民幣\" as \"4,000 billion renminbi\" instead of \"400 billion renminbi.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have publicly announced the renewal of a five-year currency swap agreement. The scale of the agreement has been expanded from the original 400 billion renminbi (470 billion HK$) to 500 billion renminbi (590 billion HK$).\n\n# Banking Sector\n\n# February 21\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) introduced temporary convenience measures in response to the pandemic, allowing the sale of specific insurance products through non-face-to-face methods, and collaborated to review sandbox schemes involving authorized institutions selling insurance products in a non-face-to-face manner.\n\n# March 16\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding a policy change by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"buffers,\" \"immediate,\" and \"effective.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and conveys the intended meaning.\n- Most translations use \"countercyclical capital buffer ratio,\" which is a standard term in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"with immediate effect,\" which is correct, but \"publicly announced\" is slightly more formal than necessary.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"reduced\" and \"taking effect immediately,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less concise.\n- **Translation 3** is concise and uses \"taking effect immediately,\" which is natural in English.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"is reduced\" instead of \"has been reduced,\" which is less appropriate for a completed action.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"was reduced\" and \"taking effect immediately,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less direct.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"is reduced\" and \"with immediate effect,\" which is grammatically correct but less suitable for a completed policy change.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"has been reduced\" to reflect a completed action.\n- Use \"taking effect immediately\" or \"with immediate effect\" to convey the immediacy of the change.\n- Use \"applicable to Hong Kong\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Use \"HKMA\" as a standard abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe HKMA publicly announced that the countercyclical capital buffer ratio applicable to Hong Kong has been reduced from 2.0% to 1.0%, taking effect immediately.\n\n# March 26th\n\nThe original text discusses a collaborative initiative by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (金管局), the Social Welfare Department (社會福利署), and the Hong Kong Banking Association (銀行公會), aimed at helping social security beneficiaries in Mainland China access aid or allowances remotely during the pandemic. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the English translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"social security beneficiaries\" and \"remote channels\" correctly. However, \"Social Welfare Department\" is more precise than \"Social Welfare Department\" (though both are acceptable). The use of \"residing in the Mainland\" is appropriate.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"social welfare recipients\" is slightly less precise than \"social security beneficiaries\" in this context. Also, \"located in mainland China\" is slightly more verbose than \"residing in the Mainland.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This version is accurate and uses \"individuals receiving social security benefits\" effectively. However, \"subsidies\" is not in the dictionary for \"津貼,\" which should be \"allowance.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The translation is mostly correct, but \"Payments\" is capitalized unnecessarily and should be lowercase. Also, \"through channels\" is less precise than \"through remote channels.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation, using \"social security beneficiaries\" and \"remote channels\" correctly. It is concise and accurate, though \"residing in the Mainland\" is slightly more formal than \"located in the Mainland.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has several issues. It incorrectly uses \"affected by the pandemic\" instead of \"residing in the Mainland.\" Also, \"HKAB (banks)\" is not a standard abbreviation, and \"Payments\" is capitalized unnecessarily.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the most accurate and natural phrasing, ensuring that all dictionary terms are translated correctly. \"Social security beneficiaries\" is more precise than \"social welfare recipients\" in this context. \"Residing in the Mainland\" is more natural than \"located in mainland China.\" \"Allowance\" is the correct translation for \"津貼\" as per the dictionary. \"Remote channels\" is the most appropriate phrase for \"遙距渠道.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the Social Welfare Department and the Hong Kong Banking Association (HKAB), has introduced measures to facilitate social security beneficiaries residing in the Mainland in receiving the relevant allowances or subsidies through remote channels without needing to return to Hong Kong in person during the pandemic.\n\n# April 17\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding a new financial support initiative for SMEs. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment without principal\" and \"SME customers.\" However, \"interbank SME loan coordination mechanism\" may not be the best match for the original term \"中小企貸款協調機制,\" which refers to a coordination mechanism for SME loans, not necessarily an interbank one.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation uses \"principal payment holiday\" instead of \"interest-only repayment without principal,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original term \"還息不還本.\" It also incorrectly uses \"launched of a\" instead of \"launch of a.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly uses \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" and \"small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers.\" It also properly references the HKMA and the interbank SME loan coordination mechanism.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Similar to the third, but uses \"plan\" instead of \"scheme\" and \"SMEs customers\" instead of \"SMEs customers.\" The latter is slightly awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation uses \"interest-only repayment\" instead of \"interest-only repayment without principal,\" which is incomplete. It also uses \"banking sector's SME loan coordination mechanism,\" which is not the exact match for the original term.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of dictionary usage and structure. However, it uses \"interest-only repayment without principal repayment,\" which is redundant and less concise than \"principal payment holiday.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"協調機制\" should be translated as \"coordination mechanism\" rather than \"interbank SME loan coordination mechanism\" unless explicitly stated.\n- \"還息不還本\" should be translated as \"principal payment holiday\" or \"interest-only repayment without principal repayment.\"\n- \"支援\" should be translated as \"support.\"\n- \"中小企\" should be translated as \"small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\"\n- \"推出\" should be translated as \"launched\" or \"introduced.\"\n- \"聯同\" should be translated as \"in conjunction with\" or \"together with.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in conjunction with the SME loan coordination mechanism, announced the launch of the \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" scheme to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers.\n\n# April 20\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company) has begun accepting applications for the \"100% Guaranteed Loan\" under the \"Small and Medium Enterprises Financing Guarantee Scheme.\"\n\n# April 24\n\nThe 2020 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules have been gazetted.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) establishing a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist customers of a specific financial relief plan. The key terms in the dictionary must be translated precisely, and the overall translation must be fluent and natural in English.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"pre-approved repayment plan\" which is vague and does not match the precise term \"還息不還本\" (interest-only repayment). Also uses \"programme\" inconsistently with the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" but omits \"holiday\" and uses \"HKMA\" without clarifying it as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"principal payment holiday\" correctly but capitalizes \"Plan\" inconsistently and uses \"HKMA\" without full name.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" correctly and \"programme\" as per the dictionary. Also includes the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" and \"scheme\" from the dictionary. However, \"HKMA\" is used without the full name.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" and \"plan\" from the dictionary. Also includes the full name \"Monetary Authority of Hong Kong.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity.\n- Use \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" as the most accurate translation of \"預先批核還息不還本.\"\n- Use \"scheme\" or \"programme\" as per the dictionary, with \"scheme\" being more appropriate in this context.\n- Ensure fluency and natural English structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist customers of the \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" scheme.\n\n# May 7th\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company) has launched the \"Fixed-Rate Mortgage Pilot Programme\" and is now accepting applications.\n\n# May 8th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a consultation document on the implementation of a mandatory background reference checking programme to reduce the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a record of misconduct.\n\n# May 22nd\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) releasing a report on bank culture self-assessment, offering practices for the industry. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"industry stakeholders\" correctly. The phrase \"for reference\" is natural. However, \"Review Report on Bank Culture Self-Assessment\" is slightly awkward in structure.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less precise. \"Providing a series of practices for industry stakeholders to reference\" is slightly awkward and less formal.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"industry\" correctly. The title \"Report on the Review of Bank Culture Self-Assessment\" is clear and formal. \"For reference\" is natural.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" fully, which is more formal and precise. The title is well-structured: \"Review of the Self-Assessment of Bank Culture.\" \"Providing the industry with a series of practices for reference\" is fluent and natural.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"banking culture\" instead of \"bank culture,\" which is slightly different in nuance. \"As a reference\" is slightly less natural than \"for reference.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"Banking Culture\" correctly. The title \"Review Report on the Self-Assessment of Banking Culture\" is clear and formal. \"For reference\" is natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for clarity and formality, include the exact title of the report as per the dictionary, and use natural phrasing such as \"for reference.\" The structure should be concise and professional, avoiding redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a comprehensive report titled \"Review of the Self-Assessment of Bank Culture,\" providing the industry with a series of practices for reference.\n\n# May 29\n\nAnsin Insurance Company announces the optimization measures for the \"80% and 90% credit guarantee products\" under the \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme\" with immediate effect.\n\n# June 4\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) announces the launch of the \"Banking Industry Talent Programme\" in collaboration with the banking sector, providing short-term work opportunities and professional training for recent university graduates during the pandemic.\n\n# June 30\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority publicly announced the Green and Sustainable Banking Industry White Paper, outlining the initial concept of regulatory approaches to address climate-related matters.\n\n# July 10\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong consulted the industry on its recommendations to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\n\n# July 31\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing guidance to banks regarding simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the Government and related organizations. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"streamlining arrangements\" which is a valid translation of \"簡化安排\" from the dictionary. However, it omits \"HKMA\" and uses \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead, which is acceptable but less concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate but introduces \"that meet eligibility requirements\" which is not in the original text. The original uses \"合資格\" which is better translated as \"eligible\" rather than adding a clause about meeting requirements.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"simplified arrangements\" as per the dictionary. However, the structure \"to banks\" at the end is slightly awkward compared to placing \"to banks\" earlier in the sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original in structure and meaning. It uses \"streamlined arrangements\" which is a valid translation of \"簡化安排.\" However, \"streamlined\" is a past participle and may not be the best fit for the context of a policy or arrangement.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"HKMA\" which is more concise than the full name. It also uses \"simplified arrangements\" and \"organisations\" as per the dictionary. It is a strong candidate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and uses \"simplified arrangements\" and \"related organizations\" as per the dictionary. It uses \"regarding\" instead of \"on\" which is slightly more formal but still acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, formal, and accurately reflect the original meaning. It should use \"HKMA\" for brevity, \"simplified arrangements\" as per the dictionary, and \"organisations\" as per the dictionary. It should also place \"to banks\" in a natural position in the sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA provides guidance to banks on simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the Government and related organisations.\n\n# August 5th\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding an extension of a repayment period for trade financing loans under a specific program. The dictionary provides precise translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, though with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but includes a confusing phrase: “pre-approved repayment holiday for principal payment without principal.” This is redundant and unclear. The term “還息不還本” should be translated as “interest-only, no principal repayment” or “principal payment holiday.”\n2. **Second junior translator:** The translation is fluent but misuses “pre-approved repayment of interest without principal plan.” The phrase “pre-approved repayment of interest” is awkward and does not clearly reflect the intended meaning of “pre-approved interest-only, no principal repayment.”\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is clear and accurate, using “interest-only, no principal repayment plan.” It also correctly uses “banking sector” and “announced.” However, it omits the term “plan” in the original, which is present in the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of “interbank” for “同業” is questionable. “同業” in this context refers to the banking industry, not interbank transactions. The phrase “pre-approved interest-only payment without principal repayment scheme” is slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using “principal payment holiday scheme” and correctly translating “banking sector SME Loan Coordinating mechanism.” However, it omits the term “plan” in the original, which is present in the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using “interbank coordination mechanism for small and medium enterprises' loans” and “pre-approved principal payment holiday scheme.” It correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains clarity.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct dictionary terms.\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Accurately reflect the original meaning.\n- Avoid redundancy and ambiguity.\nBased on the above, the sixth junior translator’s translation is the closest to the ideal, but it can be improved by using “banking sector” instead of “interbank” for “同業” and ensuring that the term “plan” is included as per the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the banking sector SME loan coordination mechanism, announces the extension of the repayment period for trade financing loans under the \"pre-approved principal payment holiday plan\" by 90 days.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority (IA) collaborate to provide guidance to the industry on the regulatory requirements for using video conferences to sell long-term insurance products.\n\n# August 20\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) relaxing macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans, specifically increasing the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap from 40% to 50% for general cases. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the HKMA as the subject and use the term \"macroprudential\" or \"countercyclical macroprudential\" as required by the dictionary.\n- The term \"loan-to-value ratio\" is consistently used, which is the correct translation for \"成數\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"non-residential property\" is used correctly for \"非住宅物業.\"\n- The phrase \"adjusting upward\" or \"raising\" is used for \"上調,\" which aligns with the dictionary's \"adjust upward.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"mortgage loans\" while others use \"mortgages,\" which is acceptable but should be consistent.\n- The term \"regulatory measures\" is used in some translations, but \"regulatory\" is not the best fit for \"監管\" in this context. The dictionary provides \"regulatory,\" \"supervision,\" \"regulate,\" and \"oversight,\" but \"regulatory measures\" is more natural than \"regulatory\" alone.\n- The phrase \"adjusting upward the loan-to-value ratio cap applicable to these loans\" is slightly awkward in some translations. A smoother phrasing would be \"raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for these loans.\"\n- Some translations use \"general cases\" without clarifying what they refer to, which could be slightly ambiguous.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for brevity and clarity.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of \"mortgage loans\" or \"mortgages.\"\n- Use \"countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures\" as per the dictionary, which is more precise than \"macroprudential regulatory measures.\"\n- Use \"raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for these loans\" for smoother phrasing.\n- Clarify \"general cases\" by specifying that it refers to typical or standard cases.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for non-residential property mortgage loans, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for these loans. The cap for general cases has been increased from 40% to 50%.\n\n# September 2nd\n\nTo relieve the pressure on the working capital of small and medium-sized enterprises, the Insurance Company announced that the application period for the delayed principal repayment measures under the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" for the \"80% and 90% credit guarantee products\" will be extended by six months, until March 31, 2021.\n\nOn the same day, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the banking sector's SME loan coordination mechanism, announced the extension of the \"pre-approved principal payment holiday\" programme for six months until April 30, 2021.\n\n# September 4th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issues a notice requiring banks to implement optimized disclosure measures, providing \"dual reminders\" to retail individual customers and SME customers applying for unsecured loans and credit card products on digital platforms.\n\n# September 18\n\nUnder the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\", the maximum loan amount for each enterprise under the \"100% Guaranteed Preferential Loan\" has been increased to the aggregate of 12 months of employees' salaries and rent, or HK$5 million, whichever is lower; the maximum repayment period has been extended to 5 years.\n\n# September 29th\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) publication of a report on enhancing anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulatory efforts through the use of data and regulatory technology, as part of its digitalisation programme. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** This version is fluent and accurate, using \"anti-money laundering\" and \"counter-financing of terrorism\" as per the dictionary. It correctly uses \"digitalisation programme\" and \"strengthen.\" However, \"supervision\" is used in a way that may not fully capture the regulatory context.\n2. **Second Translation:** This is also fluent and accurate, using \"combating money laundering and terrorist financing\" and \"digitalization program.\" It correctly uses \"strengthen\" and \"regulatory technology.\" However, \"digitalization\" is spelled with a \"z\" instead of \"s\" in the dictionary, which is a minor inconsistency.\n3. **Third Translation:** This version uses \"Digital Innovation Years\" instead of \"Era,\" which is not ideal. It also uses \"step up\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is acceptable but less formal. The phrase \"combating money laundering and terrorist financing work\" is awkwardly phrased.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** This version uses \"enhance\" instead of \"strengthen,\" which is acceptable but not the best fit. It also uses \"regulatory oversight\" which is not in the dictionary. The phrase \"combating money laundering and terrorist financing\" is repeated unnecessarily.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervision\" as per the dictionary, and \"strengthen\" is used correctly. It also uses \"digitalisation programme\" and \"HKMA\" consistently.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** This version uses \"combating of money laundering and terrorist financing regulation\" which is awkward. It also uses \"elaborating\" instead of \"setting out,\" which is less direct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing\" as per the dictionary, \"strengthen\" for \"加強,\" and \"digitalisation programme\" for \"化計劃.\" It should also use \"setting out\" for \"闡明\" and \"risk-based\" for \"風險為本.\" The phrase \"as part of the HKMA’s digitalisation programme\" should be used consistently.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a report titled \"Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Era of Digital Innovation,\" setting out how it will strengthen the application of data and regulatory technology in its risk-based anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervision, as part of the HKMA’s digitalisation programme.\n\n# September 30\n\nThe original sentence is about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sharing key observations and good practices from a mystery customer inspection programme related to the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks with industry stakeholders.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"mystery customer inspection programme\" and \"retail banks.\" However, \"findings\" is used instead of \"observations,\" which is slightly different in nuance. Also, \"with industry stakeholders\" is a good choice.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"scheme\" instead of \"programme\" is acceptable, but \"mystery customers purchasing investment and insurance products in retail banking\" is awkward and unclear. The phrase \"scheme to inspect mystery customers\" misrepresents the original intent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"observation results\" which is redundant. Also, \"inspection plan\" is less precise than \"inspection programme.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of \"shares\" instead of \"shared\" is grammatically incorrect in this context. Also, \"with the industry\" is less specific than \"with industry stakeholders.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"regarding the mystery customer inspection programme\" and \"retail banking sale of investment and insurance products\" effectively. It also uses \"industry stakeholders\" appropriately.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The use of \"is sharing\" is grammatically incorrect in this context. Also, \"mystery customer scheme checking the sales\" is awkward and unclear.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"programme\" for \"計劃,\" \"retail banking\" for \"零售銀行,\" \"mystery customer\" for \"喬裝客戶,\" and \"industry stakeholders\" for \"業界.\" It should also use \"shared\" to match the past tense of the original sentence. The phrase \"main observations and good practices\" is more accurate than \"findings\" or \"results.\" The structure should clearly indicate that the HKMA is sharing these insights with the industry stakeholders.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared the main observations and good practices with industry stakeholders regarding its mystery customer inspection programme on the sale of investment and insurance products by retail banks.\n\n# November 2\n\nMortgage Securities Company announces that the application period for the \"fixed-rate mortgage pilot programme\" will be extended by one year to October 30, 2021.\n\n# November 3\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) formulation of a two-year plan to promote the adoption of compliance technology in the local banking industry, with the plan detailed in a white paper. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have produced several versions of the translation.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Junior Translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"compliance technology\" and \"white paper\" correctly. However, \"formulated\" is slightly less common than \"developed\" or \"set\" in this context.\n2. **Second Junior Translator:** This version uses \"Regtech\" instead of \"compliance technology,\" which is an acceptable alternative from the dictionary. However, \"within the local banking sector\" is slightly less natural than \"in the local banking industry.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator:** The translation is accurate and concise, using \"HKMA\" and \"contained in the white paper.\" However, \"by the local banking industry\" is slightly awkward compared to \"in the local banking industry.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator:** This is nearly identical to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"a white paper\" instead of \"the white paper.\" Both are acceptable, but \"the\" is more precise if referring to a specific document.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator:** This is very similar to the third, with the same minor issue regarding \"by the local banking industry.\"\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator:** This version uses \"programme\" instead of \"plan,\" which is acceptable. However, \"adopt Regtech\" is less natural than \"adoption of Regtech.\" Also, \"contained within a white paper\" is slightly less direct than \"contained in a white paper.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" for brevity, \"two-year plan\" as per the dictionary, \"compliance technology\" or \"Regtech\" as appropriate, and \"contained in a white paper\" for clarity. The phrase \"promote the adoption of compliance technology in the local banking industry\" is the most natural and accurate phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has formulated a two-year plan to promote the adoption of compliance technology in the local banking industry, which is contained in a white paper titled \"Harnessing the Power of Compliance Technology: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong announced the launch of the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0\" to reflect the latest trends in technological development and incorporate the latest practices in global cyber risk management, thereby enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities of the banking industry to a higher standard.\n\n# December 15th\n\nUnder the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) and the Deposit-taking Companies Association jointly issued the \"Guidelines on Banking Services for People with Intellectual Disabilities,\" listing recommended principles and good practices to provide banking services to customers in need.\n\n# December 18\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launching a unit within a professional qualifications framework focused on \"business operational risk management\" to promote talent development and enhance practitioners' professional capabilities.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, but \"Professional Competency Framework for Banking\" misrepresents the original term \"銀行專業資歷架構\" as \"Professional Competency Framework for Banking\" instead of \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework.\" Also, \"unit on 'Business Operational Risk Management'\" is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework\" and \"promote talent development.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is very similar to the second, with a slightly different phrasing. It uses \"to promote talent training\" instead of \"talent development,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and natural. It uses \"banking professional qualifications framework\" and \"operational risk management\" correctly. However, \"the launched of\" is grammatically incorrect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation has several issues. It incorrectly uses \"Payments regulator\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"launched of\" is grammatically incorrect. Also, \"Enhanced Competency framework\" misrepresents the original term.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It correctly uses \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework\" and \"promote banking industry talent training.\" The structure is clear and natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct term \"Banking Professional Qualifications Framework\" (from the dictionary).\n- Use \"operational risk management\" (from the dictionary).\n- Use \"promote\" or \"support the development of\" for \"推動.\"\n- Use \"enhance\" for \"提升.\"\n- Use \"practitioners\" for \"從業員.\"\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) as the correct name.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announces the launch of the \"Business Operational Risk Management\" unit within the Banking Professional Qualifications Framework to promote talent development in the banking industry and enhance practitioners' professional capabilities.\n\n# December 23rd\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 12月23日\". The key elements are the number \"12\" (month), \"23\" (day), and the character \"月\" (month). According to the dictionary, \"月\" must be translated as \"month,\" and the numbers \"12\" and \"23\" can be translated as either numerals or words (e.g., \"twelve\" or \"twenty-three\"). However, in standard English date formats, it is more common to use numerals rather than words for dates.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are a few issues to consider:\n1. **Use of \"23rd\" vs. \"23\":** In English, dates are often written with ordinal indicators (e.g., \"23rd\") when used in a sentence or list. However, in a simple format like \"# 12月23日,\" it is more natural to use \"23\" without the ordinal suffix, especially when the format is being directly translated.\n2. **Use of the \"#\" symbol:** The original text includes a \"#\" symbol before the date. This is not standard in English date formats, but it may be used for formatting or labeling purposes. The translations by the sixth and fifth junior translators retained the \"#\" symbol, which is appropriate if it is meant to be preserved.\n3. **Consistency in number formatting:** The dictionary allows for both numerals and words for numbers, but in this context, using numerals is more natural and concise.\nBased on these considerations, the best translation would be to retain the \"#\" symbol and use numerals for the date, without the ordinal suffix. This preserves the original format while adhering to standard English conventions.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) providing guidance to banks regarding two key areas: (1) offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels, and (2) simplifying the disclosure of investment products for non-retail banking customers who are familiar with investments.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"non-face-to-face\" and \"simplifies disclosure.\" However, it omits the word \"HKMA\" and uses \"The HKMA\" instead of \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is less formal and less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"sophisticated retail banking customers\" instead of \"non-retail banking customers.\" This is a critical error, as \"non-retail\" and \"retail\" are opposites in this context. Also, \"streamlining\" is used instead of \"simplifying,\" which may not fully capture the intended meaning.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"non-face-to-face,\" \"streamlining,\" and correctly identifies \"non-retail banking customers who are familiar with investments.\" The structure is clear and fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is very close to the best version. It uses \"non-face-to-face,\" \"simplifying,\" and correctly identifies \"non-retail banking customers familiar with investments.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"simplifying\" instead of \"streamlining,\" which may be less precise in a regulatory context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is slightly awkward due to the placement of \"familiar\" and the use of \"streamlining\" without a clear object. It also omits the word \"HKMA\" and uses \"The HKMA\" instead of the full name.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is the least accurate. It incorrectly states that the HKMA \"provides investment services through non-face-to-face channels,\" which misrepresents the original text. It also uses \"streamline\" in an incorrect form and places \"providing guidance\" at the end, which disrupts the flow.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"non-face-to-face\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"simplified\" or \"streamlining\" for \"簡化,\" with \"streamlining\" being more appropriate in a regulatory context.\n- Accurately reflect \"non-retail banking customers who are familiar with investments.\"\n- Maintain a clear and fluent structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels and on streamlining the disclosure of investment products for non-retail banking customers who are familiar with investments.\n\n# December 31\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a summary of the public consultation on the proposed rules suspending the termination rights of financial contracts applicable to authorized institutions, as recommended under Section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance (Cap. 628), and consulted the industry on the draft rules.\n\n# Hong Kong’s International Financial Centre Status\nThe original title, \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位,\" is a concise heading that emphasizes Hong Kong's standing as a global financial hub. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the key terms, and the junior translators have produced variations that are mostly accurate but differ in style and fluency.\nTranslation 1: \"Hong Kong’s International financial centre status\" – This is grammatically correct but lacks consistency in capitalization (\"International\" should be lowercase unless it's the start of a sentence or title).\nTranslation 2: \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\" – This is well-structured and grammatically sound. It uses \"Status\" with a capital letter, which is appropriate for a title. However, \"Status\" may not be the most natural choice for \"地位\" in this context, as \"position\" or \"role\" might be more fitting depending on the nuance.\nTranslation 3: \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status\" – This is nearly identical to Translation 1 but with consistent lowercase usage. It is grammatically correct and fluent.\nTranslation 4: \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre position\" – This uses \"position\" for \"地位,\" which is a valid alternative. However, \"position\" may not convey the same level of prestige or established role as \"status\" or \"status as.\"\nTranslation 5: \"# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\" – This is a direct translation with proper capitalization and structure. The use of a hashtag is consistent with the original text, though it may not be necessary in all contexts.\nTranslation 6: \"Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre\" – This is the most natural and fluent translation. It uses \"status as\" to convey the meaning of \"地位\" effectively and is grammatically sound.\nConsidering all the translations, the best approach would be to use \"status as\" to reflect the nuance of \"地位\" and ensure proper capitalization and structure. The hashtag from the original text can be retained if it is appropriate for the context.\nBased on this review, the most improved and natural translation would be:\nHong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\n# January 22nd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand have publicly announced the results of the joint research programme on central bank digital currency — the \"Inthanon-LionRock\" project — and published a research report. The project aims to study the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments.\n\n# 2\nThe original text is \"# 2月\", which translates to \"# 2 month\" or \"# February\" depending on the context. The dictionary provides two options for \"2\" — \"2\" or \"two\" — and one option for \"月\" — \"month\".\nReview of junior translations:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 2月**  \n   - This is a direct copy of the original text and does not provide a translation.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: February**  \n   - This translation assumes that \"2月\" refers to the month of February. However, without additional context, this may not be accurate. \"2月\" could be referring to the second month in a calendar year, which is February, but it could also be referring to a specific date or event in the second month.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 2 month**  \n   - This is a literal translation using the dictionary terms. It is grammatically correct but lacks fluency and naturalness in English.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: February**  \n   - Same as the second translation, this assumes \"2月\" refers to the month of February. It is concise but lacks context.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: # 2 month**  \n   - Same as the third translation, this is a literal translation using the dictionary terms. It is grammatically correct but lacks fluency and naturalness in English.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: # 2**  \n   - This is a direct copy of the original text and does not provide a translation.\nReasoning for improvement:\n- The original text \"# 2月\" is likely a heading or label, possibly indicating a section or chapter. The use of the \"#\" symbol suggests it is a numbered section.\n- The term \"2月\" should be translated as \"2 month\" based on the dictionary, but in English, it is more natural to say \"February\" when referring to the second month of the year.\n- However, without additional context, it is safer to use the literal translation \"2 month\" to avoid misinterpretation.\nImproved translation:\n# 2 month\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been appointed as Co-Chair of the Assessment and Compliance Working Group under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), with a two-year term from 2020 to 2022.

The hashtag from the original text can be retained if it is appropriate for the context.\nBased on this review, the most improved and natural translation would be:\nHong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n\n# May 5th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission jointly initiated the Cross-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance.\n\n# May 20th\n\nHong Kong’s Currency and Financial Research Centre published its first fintech research report, titled \"Adoption and Innovation of Financial Technology in the Hong Kong Banking Industry.\"\nThe original text is a formal announcement about the release of a research report by a specific institution. The key elements to translate accurately are the name of the institution, the title of the report, and the core terms such as \"金融科技採用和創新\" (FinTech adoption and innovation).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary and Financial Centre\" and \"application of financial research report,\" which is awkward and unclear. \"Application of financial research report\" is not a standard phrase. Also, \"Banking Industry's Adoption and Innovation of Financial Technology\" is grammatically correct but lacks conciseness.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" and \"applied financial research report,\" which is more natural. The title \"FinTech Adoption and Innovation in Hong Kong's Banking Industry\" is concise and accurate. However, \"applied financial research report\" may not be the best fit for the original term \"應用金融研究報告.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, but uses \"applied financial research report\" and the title is well-structured. However, \"applied\" may not be the best translation for \"應用\" in this context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Currency and Financial Research Centre\" and \"applied finance research report.\" The title is concise but lacks the nuance of \"金融科技\" (FinTech), which is better captured by \"Fintech\" rather than \"technology.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Currency and Finance Research Institute\" and \"fintech research report,\" which is accurate. However, \"top titled\" is incorrect and should be \"titled.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"monetary and financial research centre\" and \"report on the adoption of financial technology and innovation in Hong Kong’s banking sector.\" This is grammatically correct and natural, but \"report on\" may not be the best fit for \"報告\" in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong’s Currency and Financial Research Centre\" as per the dictionary, \"fintech research report\" to capture the essence of \"應用金融研究報告,\" and the title should be concise and accurate. The phrase \"titled\" is more appropriate than \"top titled,\" and \"Adoption and Innovation of Financial Technology in the Hong Kong Banking Industry\" is both accurate and natural.\n\n# June 29th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the People's Bank of China and the Macao Financial Authority, issued a joint announcement, announcing the launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\n# August 3\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局與國際結算銀行創新樞紐轄下香港中心推出「創科挑戰賽—貿易融資數碼化」。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority has launched the \"TechChallenge - Digitalisation of Trade Financing\" initiative under the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements' Hong Kong Centre.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"TechChallenge\" and \"Digitalisation of Trade Financing\" from the dictionary. Properly identifies \"Bank for International Settlements\" (BIS).  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority\" is not in the dictionary; the term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Payments\" (though this is likely a misalignment in the dictionary). Also, the structure is slightly awkward with \"initiative under the Innovation Hub.\"\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, under the Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the International Settlement Bank, launched the \"TechChallenge - Digitalisation of Trade Financing\".*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"TechChallenge\" and \"Digitalisation of Trade Financing\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The phrase \"under the Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub\" is grammatically awkward and unclear. Also, \"International Settlement Bank\" is not the standard term for \"國際結算銀行\" (which is \"Bank for International Settlements\").\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the International Settlement Bank launched the “TechChallenge – Trade Financing Digitalisation”.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"TechChallenge\" and \"Trade Financing Digitalisation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Omits \"金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), which is a key entity in the original text. Also, \"International Settlement Bank\" is not the standard term.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the Hong Kong Centre under the Innovation Hub of the International Settlement Bank, launched the \"TechChallenge – Digitalisation of Trade Financing\".*  \n   - **Strengths**: Includes both \"金管局\" and \"TechChallenge\" correctly.

The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, such as \"金管局\" (HKMA), \"總裁\" (Governor), \"會議\" (meeting), and \"視像形式\" (video conference).\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Payments aggregate\" for \"金管局總裁\" which is incorrect. \"Payments\" is only part of the term, and \"aggregate\" is not appropriate. Also, \"Phase II\" is used for \"第二節\" which is not the best fit. The translation is awkward and lacks fluency.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Accurately uses \"Governor of the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong\" and \"video conference.\" The structure is clear and fluent. However, \"Governor's Meeting\" is slightly awkward; \"Governors' Meeting\" is more natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority Governor\" which is slightly less formal than \"Governor of the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong.\" The use of \"video conferencing\" is correct, and the structure is fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Incorrectly uses \"Payments\" for \"金管局\" and \"video\" instead of \"video conference.\" The structure is also awkward, with \"first session\" placed after the meeting name.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Governor\" which is clear and formal. \"In a video format\" is less natural than \"via video conference.\" The structure is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Incorrectly uses \"Payments Management Bureau\" for \"金管局\" and \"Phase II\" for \"第二節.\" The translation is also awkward and lacks clarity.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Governor of the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong\" for \"金管局總裁,\" \"video conference\" for \"視像形式,\" and \"Governors' Meeting\" for \"行長級會議.\" The structure should clearly indicate that the first session was held via video conference, and the second session was held on November 16 via the same format.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Governor of the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong chaired the first session of the 25th Governors' Meeting of the Central Banks of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EMEAP) via video conference. The second session of the meeting was held via video conference on November 16.\n\n# August 21st\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement of a research report published by the Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre. The key elements to translate accurately include the title of the report, the institution's name, and the specific terms related to compliance and regulatory environments.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"Application of Financial Research Report\" is awkward and unclear. \"Monetary and Financial Studies\" is not a standard name for the institution, and \"Changing Compliance\" should be \"Ever-changing Compliance\" as per the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Currency and Finance Institute\" is incorrect; the correct term is \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre.\" \"Phase II of its application Finance reports\" is unclear and grammatically awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the first, \"Application of Financial Research Report\" is awkward. The title is correctly translated, but the institution's name is not fully accurate.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is more fluent and accurate. \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" is correct, and \"ever-changing compliance and regulatory environment\" is properly used. However, \"applied finance research report\" is slightly off; \"applied financial research report\" is better.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" correctly and \"compliance and regulatory environment in transition\" is a natural and accurate rendering of the original title.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The use of \"Currency and Financial research Institute\" is incorrect. \"Second phase application financial research report\" is awkward and unclear.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" as the institution's name, \"artificial intelligence\" for \"人工智能,\" and \"ever-changing compliance and regulatory environment\" for \"轉變中的合規與監管環境.\" The title should be rendered as \"Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Banking: Compliance and Regulatory Environment in Transition\" to reflect the dynamic nature of the environment accurately.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre published the second applied financial research report titled \"Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Banking: Compliance and Regulatory Environment in Transition.\"\n\n# August 31\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Cap. 637) has been implemented, enabling investment funds to be established in Hong Kong as limited liability partnerships.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"established\" for \"成立\" and \"limited liability partnerships\" for the legal structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Form of limited liability partnerships\" is slightly awkward; \"in the form of a limited liability partnership\" is more natural.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"a limited liability partnership\" which is more natural than plural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slight redundancy in \"allowing investment funds to be established.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"implemented\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Limited partnership sessions\" is incorrect; \"sessions\" is not a legal term and does not match \"形式.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"形式\" is incorrectly translated as \"sessions.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Ordinance on Limited Partnership Funds\" which is a natural title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Form of limited liability partnerships\" is slightly awkward.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"implementation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Establish in Hong Kong\" is grammatically incorrect; should be \"to be established in Hong Kong.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"under a limited liability partnership form,\" which is natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Ordinance on Limited Partnership Funds\" is slightly less formal than \"Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** Correct.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Ordinance\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"established\" for \"成立.\"\n- Use \"limited liability partnership\" for the legal structure.\n- Use \"in the form of\" or \"under the form of\" for \"形式.\"\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance (Cap. 637) was implemented, allowing investment funds to be established in Hong Kong in the form of a limited liability partnership.\n\n# November 2 to 6\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and InvestHK co-hosted the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020,\" attracting over 1.2 million attendees from more than 130 economies.

The dictionary provides translations for \"月\" (month), \"6\" (6 or six), and \"1\" (1 or one). All junior translators have translated the date as \"November 16\" or \"November 16th,\" which are both acceptable in English. However, the use of \"16th\" is more precise and formal, aligning with standard English date formatting. The \"#\" symbol is retained in the original, but it is not standard in English date formats. Therefore, the best translation would be \"November 16th\" without the \"#\".\n\nThe original sentence is: \"在政府債券計劃下發行第七批零售通脹掛鈎債券(iBond)。\"\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   *\"Under the Government bond programme, the seventh batch of retail Connect inflation-linked bonds is issued.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"Government bond programme\" and \"retail inflation-linked bonds.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Connect\" is used without context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. \"Batch\" is less formal than \"tranche\" in financial contexts. The verb \"is issued\" is passive and less direct than \"issuance.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   *\"Under the Government bond programme, the seventh tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) is issued.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"tranche\" appropriately, which is standard in financial terminology. Correctly includes \"(iBond)\" in parentheses.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"is issued\" is passive and less direct. \"Government bond programme\" is correct, but \"programme\" is British English; the sentence could be more neutral.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   *\"Issuance of the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the Government Bond Programme.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"issuance\" effectively and places it at the beginning for clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Batch\" is less formal than \"tranche.\" \"Government Bond Programme\" uses \"Bond\" with a capital letter, which may be inconsistent with the dictionary's \"bond\" (lowercase).\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   *\"Under the government bond program, the issuance of the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond).\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"issuance\" and \"batch\" appropriately.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"program\" is American English, while \"programme\" is more formal and consistent with the dictionary. \"Batch\" is again less formal than \"tranche.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   *\"Issuance of the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBonds) under the Government bond programme.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"issuance\" and \"programme\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"batch\" is less formal, and \"iBonds\" is plural, but the original uses \"iBond\" (singular), which may be a mistake or a specific term.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   *\"Under the Government bond programme, the issuance of the seventh batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond).\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"issuance\" and \"programme\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"batch\" is less formal than \"tranche.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"Programme\" is preferred over \"program\" for consistency with the dictionary and formal tone.\n- \"Tranche\" is more appropriate than \"batch\" in financial contexts.\n- \"Issuance\" is a strong, formal verb that conveys the action clearly.\n- \"iBond\" should remain singular as per the original, unless the context clearly indicates multiple types.\n- \"Inflation-linked bonds\" is the correct term, and \"Connect\" should not be used unless it's part of a specific financial mechanism (e.g., Bond Connect), which is not indicated here.\n### Final Translation:\nIssuance of the seventh tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the Government bond programme.\n\n# November 24\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement about the publication of a research report by the Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre. The key elements to translate accurately include the name of the institution, the title of the report, and specific terms such as \"green bonds,\" \"market ecosystem,\" and \"sustainable growth.\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" and \"Green Bonds Market.\" However, \"applied financial research report\" is slightly awkward; \"applied financial research\" is not a standard term in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"Institute\" for \"中心\" and \"Working Paper\" for \"研究報告,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise. \"Healthy\" is a less common term than \"sound\" or \"robust\" in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Institute of Finance and Monetary Research\" and \"Applied Financial Research Report,\" which is more precise than \"applied financial research.\" However, \"its\" is unnecessary and slightly informal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Contains several errors, including \"top\" instead of \"titled\" and \"bond markets\" instead of \"bond market.\" The use of \"to build\" is grammatically incorrect in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"applied finance research report\" instead of \"applied financial research report,\" which is slightly off. \"Robust\" is a good synonym for \"sound\" but may be more intense than needed.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"monetary and financial research Institute\" with a lowercase \"I\" and \"bond markets\" instead of \"bond market.\" Also, \"to build\" is grammatically incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre\" as the institution's name, \"Green Bond Market\" as the title element, and \"Building a Sound Market Ecosystem for Sustainable Growth\" as the subtitle. The term \"report\" should be used in the singular, and \"applied financial research report\" is more accurate than \"applied finance research report.\" The use of \"sound\" is more standard in this context than \"robust\" or \"healthy.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre published the third applied financial research report titled \"Hong Kong Green Bond Market: Building a Sound Market Ecosystem for Sustainable Growth.\"\n\n# November 27\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"# 11月27日\". The key elements are \"11月\" (November) and \"27日\" (27th day). According to the dictionary, \"月\" should be translated as \"month\" and \"27\" as \"27\". The number \"11\" is not in the dictionary, so it can be translated as \"11\" or \"eleven\", but in date formats, numbers are typically used.\nThe first junior translator used \"November 27th\", which is grammatically correct and natural in English. However, the \"th\" is not necessary in this context, as the original text does not include it.\nThe second and third translators used \"November 27\", which is concise and appropriate for a date format.\nThe fourth translator used \"11 month 27 day\", which is not natural in English and does not follow standard date conventions.\nThe fifth and sixth translators used \"# November 27\", which includes the \"#\" symbol from the original text. However, in English, the \"#\" symbol is not typically used in date formats unless it has a specific meaning in the context, which is not provided here.\nThe best translation would be \"November 27\", as it is concise, follows standard date conventions, and does not include unnecessary elements like \"th\" or \"#\".\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been appointed as Chair of the EMEAP Resolution Mechanism Study Group; the group is a specially established resolution mechanism organization that provides support for knowledge sharing and seminars on cross-border resolution among regional authorities.\n\n# December 6th\n\nThe original text announces a new feature of the Faster Payment System (\"轉數快\") in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to bind their bank accounts using their Hong Kong ID numbers to receive payments from institutions. The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, though with varying degrees of fluency and accuracy.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is concise and accurate, using \"citizens\" and \"payments issued by institutions.\" However, it omits the system's full name (\"轉數快\") and uses \"via\" instead of \"through,\" which is slightly less natural in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This version includes the system's full name in quotes and uses \"functions\" instead of \"feature,\" which is slightly off. It also adds \"through banks\" redundantly, as the system is already mentioned as the mechanism.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"people (of Hong Kong)\" as per the dictionary, which is acceptable but less natural than \"citizens.\" Also, \"New functions\" should be lowercase unless it's a title.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Repeats \"Faster Payment System\" unnecessarily and uses \"link\" instead of \"bind,\" which is less precise. The phrase \"via banks\" is redundant and awkward.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"people (of Hong Kong)\" and \"Hong Kong’s identity card number,\" which is slightly off. Also, \"bind\" is used correctly, but the structure is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most fluent and accurate translation. It uses \"citizens,\" \"link,\" and \"via banks\" appropriately, and it avoids redundancy. However, it omits the system's full name in quotes, which is important for clarity.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should include the system's full name in quotes, use \"citizens\" for \"市民,\" \"bind\" for \"綁定,\" and \"issued by institutions\" for \"由機構發放.\" It should also avoid redundancy and ensure natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFaster Payment System \"FPS\" has launched a new function, allowing citizens to bind their bank accounts via banks using their Hong Kong ID numbers to receive payments issued by institutions.\n\n# December 14 to 15.\nThe original text is a simple date range: \"12月14至15日,\" which translates to \"December 14 to 15.\" The dictionary provides several options for translating the numbers and \"月,\" but the most natural and fluent translation is \"December 14 to 15.\" This avoids unnecessary ordinal suffixes like \"th\" and keeps the format concise and standard in English. The use of \"to\" is appropriate for indicating a range of dates. The other translations either include unnecessary punctuation (like the \"#\") or use awkward phrasing such as \"12 month 14 to 15 day,\" which is not idiomatic in English. The best translation is the one that is both accurate and natural in English usage.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about a collaborative event organized by the Green Finance Centre and the International Finance Corporation. The key elements to translate accurately are the names of the organizations, the event title, and the nature of the collaboration.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Green Finance Centre\" and \"International Finance Corporation.\" The structure is clear and the event title is properly enclosed in quotation marks. However, \"organized\" could be more precise as \"co-hosted\" or \"co-organized.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate but slightly awkward in phrasing. \"Co-hosted the inaugural 'International Financial Company Climate Business Network Seminar' with the International Financial Company\" is repetitive and slightly unclear. \"Financial Company\" should be \"Finance Corporation\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It correctly uses \"co-hosted\" and \"International Finance Corporation.\" However, it omits the \"Green Finance Centre\" as the subject, which is a key part of the original sentence.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"co-organized\" and correctly identifies the Green Finance Centre and the International Finance Corporation. However, \"co-organized\" is slightly less natural than \"co-hosted\" in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is problematic. It incorrectly uses \"Financial Market Infrastructure\" and \"Payments\" instead of \"Infrastructure Financing.\" It also misuses \"International Corporation\" instead of \"International Finance Corporation.\" This translation is not accurate and should be avoided.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is very poor. It misuses \"Payments\" and \"Financial centre\" instead of \"Finance Corporation.\" The structure is unclear and the event title is not properly enclosed in quotation marks. This translation is not acceptable.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the structure of the original sentence.\n- Use the correct terms from the dictionary.\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Clearly indicate the collaboration between the Green Finance Centre and the International Finance Corporation.\n- Properly enclose the event title in quotation marks.\nBased on the review, the best translation would combine the strengths of the first and fourth junior translators, using \"co-hosted\" and ensuring the Green Finance Centre is clearly identified as the subject.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Green Finance Centre established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office co-hosted the first \"International Finance Corporation Climate Business Network Seminar\" with the International Finance Corporation.\n\n# December 17th\n\nThe original text discusses the release of a strategy plan by a cross-agency steering group on green and sustainable finance, aiming to strengthen Hong Kong's financial ecosystem from six aspects. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and term selection.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"Cross-Agency Steering Group\" and \"strategy plan,\" which are appropriate. However, \"proposing to strengthen\" is slightly awkward compared to \"proposing to consolidate.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"recommend\" instead of \"propose,\" which is less precise in this context. Also, \"six aspects to consolidate\" is grammatically awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the first, but \"proposing to strengthen\" is slightly less natural than \"proposing to consolidate.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"strategic plan\" and \"consolidate,\" which are more natural. \"Launched\" is a good alternative to \"released.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"cross-agency\" with a lowercase \"a,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry. Otherwise, the translation is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"cross-agency\" with a lowercase \"a\" and \"consolidate,\" which is appropriate. However, \"on Green and Sustainable Finance\" is slightly less formal than \"for Green and Sustainable Finance.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"Cross-Agency Steering Group\" (as per the dictionary), \"strategic plan\" (more natural than \"strategy plan\"), \"launched\" (more dynamic than \"released\"), and \"consolidate\" (more precise than \"strengthen\" in this context). Also, \"for green and sustainable finance\" is more natural than \"on green and sustainable finance.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group launched a strategic plan for green and sustainable finance, proposing to consolidate Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem from six aspects.\n\n# December 21\n\nThe original sentence, \"轉數快付款功能擴展至政府繳費櫃枱及自助服務機,\" translates to a statement about the expansion of a payment system's functionality to government payment counters and self-service machines. The dictionary provides specific terms that must be translated exactly, such as \"轉數\" and \"快\" which are associated with \"Faster Payment System\" or \"FPS,\" and \"政府\" which should be translated as \"Government\" or \"government.\"\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Faster Payment System functions have been extended to government payment counters and self-service kiosks.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Faster Payment System\" and \"government.\" The term \"kiosks\" is appropriate for \"自助服務機.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Functions\" is a bit generic and could be more precise. \"Kiosks\" is slightly less common than \"machines\" in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Faster Payment System (FPS) functions have been extended to Government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" in parentheses, which is helpful for clarity. \"Government\" is capitalized, which may be appropriate depending on context.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Functions\" is still generic. \"Government\" is capitalized, which may not be necessary unless referring to a specific entity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"FPS payment functions have been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"FPS\" and \"machines\" appropriately.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Payment functions\" is redundant since \"FPS\" already implies a payment system.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Same as the third, so similar strengths and weaknesses.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Faster Payment System (FPS) payment functions have been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses both \"Faster Payment System\" and \"FPS\" for clarity.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Payment functions\" is redundant and slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The Faster Payment System (FPS) payment functions have been extended to Government payment counters and self-service machines.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"The\" for a more formal tone and includes both \"Faster Payment System\" and \"FPS.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Payment functions\" is still redundant and \"Government\" is capitalized unnecessarily.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- Avoid redundancy by not repeating \"payment\" after \"FPS.\"\n- Use \"machines\" for \"自助服務機\" as it is more commonly used in this context.\n- Use \"government\" in lowercase unless referring to a specific entity.\n- Ensure the sentence is concise and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFaster Payment System (FPS) functions have been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\n\n# December 22nd\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行第五批銀色債券,\" translates to \"Issuance of the fifth batch of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Programme.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\n**Translation 1** is concise and accurate, using \"issuance\" and \"Government Bond Programme\" correctly. It is grammatically sound and fluent.\n**Translation 2** is also accurate and fluent, with a slightly different structure that still conveys the same meaning clearly.\n**Translation 3** introduces the word \"planned,\" which is not present in the original text and adds an unnecessary nuance. This makes it less accurate.\n**Translation 4** uses \"Bonds\" with a capital \"B,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's suggestion of \"bond\" or \"bonds\" (lowercase unless proper noun). It is otherwise accurate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Issue\" as a verb, which is grammatically incorrect in this context. The original uses \"發行,\" which is best translated as \"issuance\" or \"issue\" as a noun, not a verb.\n**Translation 6** uses \"tranche\" instead of \"batch,\" which is a more formal and appropriate term in financial contexts. However, it adds \"will be issued,\" which is not in the original and introduces a future tense not present in the original sentence.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate financial terminology. \"Batch\" is acceptable, but \"tranche\" is more precise in this context. \"Programme\" is preferred over \"program\" in British English, which aligns with the dictionary's options. The verb \"issuance\" is more formal and appropriate than \"issue\" as a verb.\n**Final Translation:**\nIssuance of the fifth tranche of Silver Bonds under the Government Bond Programme.\n\n# December 17, 21, and 22.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority led a delegation from the Hong Kong Bankers Association (HKAB) in a video conference meeting with Mainland financial management authorities to discuss recent developments in financial growth in both places.\n\n# Reserves Management\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in formatting and capitalization. The term \"儲備\" is correctly translated as \"Reserves\" or \"Reserve,\" and \"管理\" is appropriately rendered as \"Management\" or \"management.\" However, the use of capitalization and the presence of the \"#\" symbol in some translations introduce unnecessary variation.\nThe most consistent and professionally formatted translation is \"Reserves Management,\" which uses proper capitalization and avoids any extraneous symbols. This translation is both grammatically correct and culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience. It also adheres to the dictionary's guidelines by using \"Reserves\" for \"儲備\" and \"Management\" for \"管理.\"\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is \"Reserves Management.\"\n\n# December 18\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong announced that it will conduct a market survey on the \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio,\" which serves as part of the government's \"Future Fund.\"\n\n# Functions of Institutions\n\n# November 13\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the public education online drama series \"STEPS\" on its social media platform, introducing the Authority's work in different areas.\n\n# December 31\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority opened 11 additional sets of financial data published on its website in 2020 through an open Application Programming Interface, making them available for free use by the public.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

pandemic, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year in 2020, recording the most severe decline in its history. Consumption and tourism-related sectors were particularly hard-hit, with their contraction magnitude exceeding that of the overall economy. At the same time, the labor market sharply deteriorated, while inflation moderated. To address the challenging economic environment, the Government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the largest-scale relief measures ever to support the economy. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to restore normal economic activities, with the economy anticipated to recover growth in 2021. However, the strength and pace of economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp decline in economic activity was primarily due to a drastic contraction in local demand (Chart 1). The outbreak of the pandemic and the corresponding social distancing measures severely hit local consumption activities. Due to a deteriorating business environment, overall investment expenditure also significantly decreased. On the external front, despite the pandemic causing supply chain disruptions and a contraction in global demand, Hong Kong's goods exports only slightly declined for the year as a whole, partly benefiting from Mainland China's rapid recovery in production and economic activities. In contrast, Hong Kong's service exports were severely affected due to lockdowns, border closures, and restrictions on tourist flows, which brought the global tourism industry to a standstill. Weak demand driven by local and re-export activities also led to a deterioration in goods imports and service inputs. As the decline in import volumes outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to Hong Kong's gross domestic product (Chart 1). By economic sector analysis, consumption and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food services, were particularly hard-hit, with contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector experienced mild growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic Gross Production Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\n# Economy and Financial Environment\n\nChart 1: Contribution of Components to Real Domestic Gross Value Added Growth\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻,\" is a technical economic title that should be translated with precision and clarity. The dictionary provides specific terms that must be used, such as \"圖\" (Chart), \"實質\" (real), \"本地\" (domestic\/local), \"生產總值\" (Gross Value Added or GDP), and \"增長\" (growth). \n1. **Translation 1** uses \"Gross Production Value\" instead of the more standard \"Gross Value Added\" or \"GDP.\" It also uses \"Domestic\" correctly but omits the \"Chart 1\" reference, which is important for clarity.\n2. **Translation 2** misrepresents the original by stating \"Chart 1 shows...\" when the original is a title, not a descriptive sentence. It also uses \"aggregate value\" instead of \"Gross Value Added\" or \"GDP.\"\n3. **Translation 3** correctly uses \"Chart 1\" and \"Gross Product Growth,\" but \"Gross Product\" is not the standard term in economics. \"Gross Value Added\" or \"GDP\" would be more appropriate.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"production total\" instead of \"Gross Value Added\" or \"GDP,\" which is not standard terminology.\n5. **Translation 5** is concise and uses \"GDP,\" which is a standard term. However, it omits \"Chart 1\" in the title format and uses \"Local\" instead of \"Domestic,\" which may not be the best fit depending on context.\n6. **Translation 6** is the most comprehensive, using \"Chart 1\" and \"Real Local Production Total Value.\" However, \"Production Total Value\" is not standard and should be replaced with \"Gross Value Added\" or \"GDP.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nChart 1: Contribution of Components to Real Domestic Gross Value Added Growth\nThis translation uses \"Chart 1\" as required, \"Real\" for \"實質,\" \"Domestic\" for \"本地,\" and \"Gross Value Added\" for \"生產總值,\" which is the most accurate and standard economic term. It maintains the structure of the original title and uses appropriate terminology.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"one-time payment\" and \"three-pronged approach.\" However, it uses \"liquidity pressure\" instead of \"funding pressure,\" which may not be the best match for the original term \"資金周轉壓力.\"\n2. **Second Translation**: This version is well-structured and uses \"Financial Budget\" instead of \"Budget,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term from the dictionary. It also uses \"rent concessions\" and \"fee exemptions,\" which are accurate. However, \"Financial Budget\" may not be the best match for \"財政預算案.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses \"one-off cash payment\" and \"three-pronged approach\" correctly. It also uses \"financial liquidity pressures,\" which is slightly off from the intended term \"資金周轉壓力.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This version has several grammatical issues, such as \"in total more than HK$3,000 billion\" (should be \"HK$3,000 billion\") and \"buffer to enhance the lending capacity of banks\" (should be \"releasing buffer\"). It also uses \"way\" instead of \"approach\" for \"方式.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"one-off HK$10,000 cash payment\" and \"three-pronged approach\" correctly. It also uses \"hard-hit industries\" and \"fee waivers,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"financial pressure\" instead of \"funding pressure.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is very accurate and uses \"one-off HK$10,000 cash payment\" and \"three-pronged approach\" correctly. It also uses \"liquidity pressure\" and \"rent concessions,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"Financial Budget\" instead of \"Budget.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the most accurate terms from the dictionary, maintain fluency, and ensure grammatical correctness. Based on the above review, the best version would combine the strengths of the first, second, and sixth translations, using \"Budget\" for \"財政預算案,\" \"one-off\" for \"一筆過,\" \"three-pronged approach\" for \"三管齊下,\" and \"liquidity pressure\" for \"資金周轉壓力.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Government swiftly launched the largest-scale relief measures in response to the pandemic through the 2020-21 Budget, disbursing four rounds of assistance totaling over HK$300 billion from the \"Anti-Epidemic Fund.\" These measures included providing eligible residents with a one-off HK$10,000 cash payment, offering wage subsidies through the \"Employment Support Scheme,\" and providing one-off funding to hard-hit industries, rent concessions, and fee exemptions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopted a three-pronged approach to support the banking sector, thereby underpinning the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with the banking sector to alleviate liquidity pressure on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks' lending capacity, and ensuring banks have sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressure clearly weakened in 2020. Netting out the impact of one-off government relief measures, the core inflation rate moderated to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis in 2009. Price pressures on basic foodstuffs, particularly fresh pork, clearly receded; and apart from home cooking, the cost of dining out also declined in the second half of the year due to substantial discounts offered by the catering industry. With the recent decline in newly signed private residential rents, the growth of the housing component of the consumer price index also softened (Chart 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures decreased due to slower nominal wage growth and softer commercial property rents; and under weak global economic conditions, import price inflation eased.\n\nChart 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nThe original text is \"圖 2 基本消費物價通脹.\" The dictionary provides several options for translation, and the goal is to produce a fluent, accurate, and culturally appropriate English translation.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"Chart 2 Core Consumer Price Inflation\"** – This translation uses \"Core\" instead of \"Basic,\" which is not listed in the dictionary. While \"Core\" is a common term in economics, it is not an exact match for \"基本\" and may mislead the reader.\n2. **\"Chart 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\"** – This is accurate and uses the dictionary term \"Basic\" for \"基本\" and \"Consumer Price\" for \"消費物價.\" It is a strong translation.\n3. **\"Chart 2 Consumer Price Inflation\"** – This omits \"Basic,\" which is part of the original phrase. It is less precise and may not convey the intended nuance.\n4. **\"Chart 2 consumer price corridor\"** – This uses \"corridor\" for \"通,\" which is one of the dictionary options. However, \"corridor\" is not a standard term in the context of inflation and is likely incorrect.\n5. **\"Chart 2 Basic consumer price inflation\"** – This is similar to the second translation but uses lowercase for \"consumer,\" which is not standard in titles.\n6. **\"Chart 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\"** – This is identical to the second translation and is accurate and well-formatted.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the exact dictionary terms where applicable and maintain proper grammar and formatting. \"Basic\" is the correct translation for \"基本\" as per the dictionary, and \"Consumer Price\" is the correct translation for \"消費物價.\" \"通脹\" is best translated as \"Inflation,\" which is standard in economic terminology. \"圖\" is best translated as \"Chart\" with a capital letter, and \"2\" should be a numeral, not the word \"two.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nChart 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe labor market sharply deteriorated in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% during the year, reaching a 16-year high (Chart 3), with unemployment rates in hard-hit sectors such as retail, accommodation, and food services exceeding 10%. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest level since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to a cyclical response caused by the sharp deterioration in economic conditions, the labor force participation rate slightly decreased. Total employment (Chart 3) and job vacancies in private-sector institutions sharply declined, reflecting further contraction in overall labor demand. Nominal wage and income growth further slowed. The government launched the \"Employment Support Scheme (ESS)\" to provide time-limited financial support to employers to retain employees, giving the labor market a certain degree of support.\n\nChart 3 Labour Market Conditions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in terms of style and consistency. The first, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Chart 3 Labour Market Situation,\" while the second, third, fourth, and sixth use \"Chart 3 Labour Market Conditions.\" The difference lies in the translation of the term \"狀況\" (situation\/conditions). Both \"situation\" and \"conditions\" are valid translations, but \"conditions\" may be more appropriate in the context of a labor market, as it refers to the state or circumstances of the market.\nThe use of \"Labour\" versus \"labor\" is also a point of variation. \"Labour\" is the British English spelling, while \"labor\" is the American English spelling. Both are correct, but the choice depends on the target audience and the preferred style guide.\nThe third and fourth translations use lowercase \"labour market conditions,\" which is less formal and may not be suitable for a title. The first, fifth, and sixth translations use title case, which is more appropriate for a chart title.\nConsidering these points, \"Chart 3 Labour Market Conditions\" is the most appropriate translation as it uses title case, the British English spelling of \"Labour,\" and the term \"conditions\" which is more commonly used in the context of labor markets.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nWith the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. Following large-scale support measures introduced by central banks and governments across the globe, the stock market saw a slight recovery in the second and third quarters (Chart 4). Due to breakthroughs in the development of the coronavirus vaccine, the stock market regained some upward momentum close to the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points at the end of the year, recording a 3.4% decline for the year as a whole. Benefiting from the secondary listing activities of Mainland enterprises in Hong Kong, the total amount raised from initial public offerings in Hong Kong in 2020 was approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising.\n\nChart 4 Asset Prices\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nPartly supported by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained broadly stable in 2020 (Chart 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared with the previous year. However, due to a decline in household income, the affordability of purchasing property became even tighter. On the other hand, the non-residential property market further weakened, with property prices recording declines of varying degrees and transaction volumes also hitting a low. Affected by the economic downturn and rising vacancy rates, office and retail property rents fell sharply. Given that the non-residential property market had already experienced a significant adjustment since 2019, and considering the expectation of continued pressure, along with other factors such as the economic outlook and external environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also revoked the double stamp duty on the purchase of non-residential properties, which was a demand management measure, in November.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"render support to\" for \"支持\" and \"for the year as a whole\" for \"全年\". However, \"Mainland China’s economy is expected to further develop\" is slightly awkward compared to \"further strengthen.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the ideal. It uses \"provide support for\" for \"支持\" and \"Mainland's economy will further strengthen.\" It also uses \"real GDP growth rate\" for \"實質本地生產總值增長率,\" which is more precise than some other translations.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also strong. It uses \"bring economic activities back to normal\" for \"使經濟活動回復正常\" and \"considerable challenges\" for \"相當程度的挑戰.\" However, \"the availability, coverage and efficacy of vaccines\" is slightly less precise than \"vaccine availability, coverage and efficacy.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent but slightly less precise in some areas. It uses \"restore normal economic activities\" for \"使經濟活動回復正常\" and \"the pace and extent of economic recovery\" for \"經濟復甦的力度及步伐.\" The phrase \"the real GDP growth rate of Hong Kong's local production\" is slightly wordy.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"return to positive growth\" for \"重拾正增長\" and \"supporting the export of services and goods from Hong Kong\" for \"為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持.\" However, \"unclear factors\" is less precise than \"uncertain factors.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"restore normalcy to economic activities\" for \"使經濟活動回復正常\" and \"providing support for Hong Kong's export of goods and services\" for \"為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持.\" It also uses \"real GDP growth rate of Hong Kong\" for \"實質本地生產總值增長率,\" which is precise.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"restore normalcy to economic activities\" for \"使經濟活動回復正常\" as it is more natural in English.\n- Use \"resuming positive growth\" for \"重拾正增長\" to match the nuance of the original.\n- Use \"uncertain factors\" for \"眾多不明朗因素\" as it is more standard in economic contexts.\n- Use \"provide support for\" for \"支持\" as it is more direct and natural.\n- Use \"real GDP growth rate\" for \"實質本地生產總值增長率\" to maintain precision.\n- Use \"consistent with the average of 4.4% from the latest growth forecasts\" for \"與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符\" to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe vaccination against the novel coronavirus is expected to restore normalcy to economic activities, with Hong Kong's economy projected to resume positive growth in 2021 (for the year as a whole). However, the strength and pace of economic recovery remain affected by numerous uncertain factors, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine availability, coverage, and efficacy. Specifically, widespread vaccination will take time, so the local economy will still face significant challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, it is expected that the Mainland economy will further strengthen and provide support for Hong Kong's export of goods and services. However, the pace of recovery in other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts that the real GDP growth rate of Hong Kong in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, consistent with the average of 4.4% from the latest growth forecasts by international organizations and private-sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and the Labour Market\n\nGiven the global and local economic conditions remain challenging, inflationary pressure in 2021 is expected to remain modest. In addition, the feed-through effect of the earlier decline in rents for newly-leased private residential properties will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts the overall inflation rate for 2021 to be 1.5%, while the government expects the overall and core inflation rates to be 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the challenging economic outlook in the early part of 2021, together with private-sector analysts' expectations that the unemployment rate for the whole of 2021 will remain at a relatively high level of around 5.9%, the labor market will continue to face pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is generally accurate and fluent, using appropriate terms like \"sound financial conditions\" and \"slightly deteriorated.\" However, it uses \"banking sector\" inconsistently and omits the dictionary term \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體.\"\n**Translation 2** has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as \"2020 year\" and \"banks’ Financial positions.\" It also uses \"deteriorated\" without the correct context and misuses \"financing\" instead of \"deposits.\"\n**Translation 3** is more fluent and adheres better to the dictionary, using \"healthy Financial positions\" and \"deposit funding.\" However, it uses \"Capital\" with a capital letter unnecessarily and omits the dictionary term \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體.\"\n**Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"resilient\" and \"healthy financial conditions\" effectively. It correctly uses \"novel coronavirus pandemic\" for \"新冠\" and \"疫情.\" However, it omits the dictionary term \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體\" in one instance.\n**Translation 5** is the most comprehensive, using \"resilient,\" \"maintaining healthy financial conditions,\" and \"increased deposit funding.\" It correctly uses \"banking sector\" and \"asset quality slightly deteriorating.\" However, it uses \"maintained\" instead of \"remained\" for \"仍.\"\n**Translation 6** is fluent and accurate, using \"resilient,\" \"sound financial conditions,\" and \"novel coronavirus pandemic.\" It correctly uses \"banking system\" for \"銀行體\" and \"slightly deteriorated.\" However, it uses \"banking system\" instead of \"banking sector\" in one instance, which may not align with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"banking sector\" consistently for \"銀行體,\" \"banking sector\" for \"銀行體系,\" and \"slightly deteriorated\" for \"輕微轉差.\" It should also use \"resilient\" or \"sound\" for \"穩健\" and \"ample\" for \"充裕.\" The most accurate and fluent translation is **Translation 5**, which uses \"resilient,\" \"maintaining healthy financial conditions,\" and \"increased deposit funding.\" However, it uses \"maintained\" instead of \"remained\" for \"仍,\" which should be corrected.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2020, with banks maintaining healthy financial conditions. Despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking sector's balance sheets continued to expand, with increased deposit funding. The banking sector maintained ample capital and liquidity positions, with asset quality slightly deteriorating, but still remaining at a healthy level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Mainland-related loans\" and \"grew marginally.\" However, \"throughout the year\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified to \"during the year.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"Mainland China-related loans\" and \"slightly decreased,\" which are appropriate. The structure is clear and the use of \"during the year\" is consistent with the original.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and contains several grammatical errors. For example, \"2020 year banking sector balance sheets grew marginally 5.7%\" is awkwardly phrased. Also, \"Hong Kong’s increased 2.2%\" is grammatically incorrect. The use of \"Mainland-related loans in Mainland China\" is redundant and confusing.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"Mainland China-related loans\" and \"declined marginally,\" which are appropriate. The structure is clear and the language is natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Related loans in Mainland China slightly declined\" and \"compared to a recorded growth,\" which are appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"related loans\" instead of \"Mainland China-related loans,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with natural language and accurate use of dictionary terms. It uses \"Mainland China-related loans\" and \"marginally fell,\" which are appropriate. The structure is clear and the language is fluent.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the dictionary terms accurately. It should avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the fourth and sixth translations are the strongest, with the sixth being slightly more natural in its phrasing.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe banking sector's balance sheet expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic downturn, loan growth slowed to 1.2% during the year, compared with an increase of 6.7% in 2019; among these, loans used in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, while loans used outside Hong Kong grew marginally by 0.1%, and trade financing decreased by 6.2%. Mainland China-related loans marginally fell by 0.2% in 2020, compared with a recorded growth of 7.4% in 2019.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared with an increase of 2.9% in 2019. Due to the faster growth of total deposits compared to total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are some minor differences in capitalization and punctuation that affect the fluency and consistency of the translations.\nTranslation 1 and 6 are identical and are the most polished, with proper capitalization and punctuation. They correctly use \"Loans and Deposits\" with capital letters and include the colon after \"Chart 5,\" which is appropriate for a title.\nTranslation 2 is similar but uses lowercase for \"loans and deposits,\" which is less formal and less suitable for a title.\nTranslation 3 and 5 are similar and use possessive form \"Banking Sector's,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common in formal titles compared to \"in the Banking Sector.\"\nTranslation 4 lacks punctuation and capitalization, making it less formal and less readable.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would be the one that maintains proper capitalization, punctuation, and clarity, which is Translation 1 and 6. The final translation should follow this standard.\n\n# Capital Adequacy Levels\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of terminology consistency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilient\" for \"穩健\" and \"buffer\" for \"緩衝,\" both of which are appropriate. The term \"composite total capital ratio\" is correctly used, and the reference to \"Chart 6\" is accurate. However, \"stood at 20.7%\" could be more natural as \"stood at 20.7%.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"stable\" for \"穩定\" and \"Tier 1\" for \"一級,\" which is correct. However, \"during the same period\" is slightly less precise than \"for the same period.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is very close to the first translation and is also accurate. It uses \"resilient\" and \"buffer\" correctly. The structure is slightly more natural, and the use of \"increased slightly to 18.7% from 18.5%\" is clear and concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has a significant error: it translates \"18.5%\" as \"1.8%,\" which is incorrect. Additionally, \"composite aggregate capital ratio\" is not a standard term; \"composite total capital ratio\" is more accurate. The use of \"edged up slightly from 1.8% to 1.8%\" is also incorrect and confusing.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"solid\" for \"穩健\" and \"robust backstop\" for \"提供...緩衝,\" which is a valid interpretation. However, \"backstop\" is less commonly used in this context than \"buffer\" or \"resilience.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"solid\" for \"穩健,\" \"buffers\" for \"緩衝,\" and \"Tier 1\" for \"一級,\" all of which are appropriate. The structure is clear and natural, and the reference to \"Chart 6\" is correct.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- \"穩健\" should be translated as \"solid\" or \"resilient,\" both of which are appropriate.\n- \"緩衝\" should be translated as \"buffers.\"\n- \"抵禦\" should be translated as \"withstand\" or \"resilience,\" but \"withstand\" is more direct in this context.\n- \"衝擊\" should be \"shocks.\"\n- \"穩定\" should be \"stable\" or \"stability.\"\n- \"一級資本比率\" should be \"Tier 1 capital ratio.\"\n- \"圖 6\" should be \"Chart 6.\"\n- \"綜合總資本比率\" should be \"composite total capital ratio.\"\n- \"本地註冊認可機構\" should be \"locally registered authorized institutions.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English phrasing.\n**Final Translation**:\nThe banking sector’s capital positions remained solid in 2020, providing strong buffers to withstand potential shocks. At the end of 2020, the composite total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions remained stable compared with the end of 2019, at 20.7%. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Chart 6).\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Basel III leverage ratio remained stable compared with that at the end of 2019, still at 8.2%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\nChart 6: Composite Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nChart 6: Composite Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Composite Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity positions remain robust, with the ability to withstand liquidity shocks during periods of stress. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 155.1% in the fourth quarter, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 57.9%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in formatting and punctuation. The first, fifth, and sixth translations lack proper punctuation, which can affect readability. The second translation uses lowercase for \"designated authorised institutions,\" which is inconsistent with standard title case. The third and fourth translations are identical and correctly use a colon after \"Chart 8,\" which is the preferred format for such titles. However, the term \"authorized\" is more commonly used in American English, while \"authorised\" is preferred in British English. Given the context and the lack of regional specification, \"authorized\" is acceptable. The term \"ratio\" is correctly used, and \"liquidity\" accurately conveys the financial concept. The term \"designated\" is correctly translated, and \"institutions\" is the most appropriate term from the dictionary provided. The use of \"Chart 8\" is correct, and the structure \"Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\" is clear and concise. The best translation would follow the structure of the third and fourth translations but ensure consistency in terminology and punctuation.\n\nThe banking sector's sources of funding remain stable. At the end of 2020, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in terms of grammar, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:** \"Chart 9: Designated Authorized Institutions' Funding Ratio\" – This translation is grammatically correct and adheres to the dictionary by using \"Chart,\" \"Designated,\" \"Authorized,\" and \"Funding Ratio.\" However, the placement of \"Designated Authorized Institutions\" before \"Funding Ratio\" may be slightly less natural than alternatives.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:** \"Chart 9 designated institutions’ financing ratio\" – This translation lacks proper punctuation (missing colon) and uses \"financing\" instead of \"funding.\" While \"financing\" is a valid synonym, the lack of punctuation and the informal structure reduce fluency.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:** \"Chart 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\" – This is a well-structured and fluent translation. It uses \"Chart,\" \"Funding Ratio,\" \"Designated,\" and \"Authorized\" correctly. The phrase \"of Designated Authorized Institutions\" is natural and clear.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:** \"Chart 9 designated authorised institutions’ funding ratios.\" – This translation uses \"authorised\" (British spelling) and \"ratios\" (plural), which may be less consistent with the context. The lack of a colon and the informal structure also reduce fluency.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:** \"Chart 9: Ratio of Funding for Designated Authorized Institutions\" – This translation is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. However, \"Ratio of Funding\" is slightly less natural than \"Funding Ratio.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:** \"Chart 9 Designated Authorized Institutions' Funding Ratio\" – This translation is grammatically correct but lacks a colon, which is typically used in titles for clarity and formality.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\nThe most natural and fluent translation is the third junior translator's version: \"Chart 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions.\" It uses the correct terms from the dictionary, maintains proper punctuation, and presents the phrase in a clear and natural order. The structure \"Funding Ratio of [Institutions]\" is commonly used in formal contexts and is more direct than alternatives like \"Ratio of Funding for [Institutions].\" Additionally, the use of \"Chart 9\" with a colon is standard in titles and headings. The terms \"Designated\" and \"Authorized\" are both correctly used and are appropriate in this context. The plural \"Institutions\" is also appropriate, as the term \"機構\" in Chinese typically refers to multiple entities.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nUnder the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector slightly declined during the year, but remains good by historical and international standards. The specific classification loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the ratio of delinquencies and restructured loans rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Chart 10). The specific classification loan ratio for Mainland China-related loans increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. The delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained at low levels, at 0.04% and 0.27% respectively (Chart 11).\n\nChart 10: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\n\nChart 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\nThe original title, \"圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率,\" translates to \"Chart 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of this title, with some minor differences in structure and word choice.\nThe first junior translator's version, \"Chart 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans,\" is accurate and follows the structure of the original title. It correctly uses \"delinquency ratio\" and \"residential mortgage loans\" and \"credit card loans\" as per the dictionary. However, the use of \"Chart 11\" with a colon is slightly more formal and appropriate for a title.\nThe second junior translator's version, \"Chart 11: Residential Mortgage Loan and Credit Card Loan Delinquency Ratios,\" is also accurate but uses \"ratios\" in the plural form, which may not be the best fit for the original term \"比率\" (ratio), which is singular in the original text.\nThe third junior translator's version is identical to the first, and the fourth is also accurate but uses \"Mortgages\" with a capital \"M,\" which is not necessary unless it's part of a proper noun or title.\nThe fifth junior translator's version, \"Chart 1 residential mortgage loans and credit card delinquency ratio,\" has a critical error: it uses \"Chart 1\" instead of \"Chart 11,\" which is a significant mistake in the context of a numbered chart.\nThe sixth junior translator's version is identical to the first, and it is accurate and well-structured.\nConsidering all the translations, the best version would be the first or the sixth, as they are identical and correctly use \"Chart 11\" with a colon, \"delinquency ratio,\" and the correct terms for \"residential mortgage loans\" and \"credit card loans.\" The use of \"Chart 11\" with a colon is more formal and appropriate for a title, and the structure is clear and concise.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is:\nChart 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nLow interest rate environment together with slightly deteriorated asset quality has suppressed banking sector profits. The overall pre-tax operating profits of retail banks dropped 29.4% in 2020 (Chart 12), mainly due to decreased net interest income (-21.9%) and increased loan impairment provisions (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nDue to decreased income, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banks increased from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Chart 14).\nThe original sentence is straightforward and factual, focusing on the relationship between income reduction and the change in the cost-to-income ratio for retail banks. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are notable differences in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\nTranslation 1 uses \"decreased income\" and \"Chart 1,\" which is slightly off since the original mentions \"圖 14\" (Chart 14). It also uses \"cost-to-income ratio,\" which is accurate, but \"Chart 1\" is incorrect.\nTranslation 2 uses \"cost and income ratio,\" which is not the standard term. The correct term is \"cost-to-income ratio.\" It also correctly uses \"Chart 14.\"\nTranslation 3 uses \"Figure 14\" instead of \"Chart 14.\" While both are acceptable, \"Chart\" is more commonly used in financial contexts, so \"Chart 14\" is preferable.\nTranslation 4 is very close to the best version, using \"cost-to-income ratio\" and \"Chart 14.\" It is fluent and accurate.\nTranslation 5 uses \"decline in revenue\" instead of \"decreased income.\" While both are similar, \"revenue\" is more specific to business income, which is appropriate here. It also uses \"Chart 14\" correctly.\nTranslation 6 uses \"decreased inflow\" instead of \"decreased income.\" \"Inflow\" is not the best match for \"收入\" in this context, as \"income\" is more precise. It also uses \"cost ratio\" instead of \"cost-to-income ratio,\" which is incorrect.\nThe best translation should use \"cost-to-income ratio,\" \"retail banks,\" and \"Chart 14.\" It should also use \"decreased income\" or \"decline in revenue\" as appropriate. Based on these considerations, the most accurate and fluent translation is:\nDue to the decline in revenue, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banks increased from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n\nChart 12: Performance of Retail Banking\nThe original phrase \"圖 12 零售銀行的表現\" translates to \"Chart 12: The performance of retail banking.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"Chart 12 retail banks' performance\" is grammatically correct but lacks the colon and title structure that is standard for chart captions. It also uses the possessive form \"retail banks'\" which may not be the most natural phrasing in this context.\nTranslation 2: \"Chart 12: Retail Banking Performance\" is concise and uses a colon, which is appropriate for a chart title. However, it omits the word \"the\" before \"performance,\" which is not strictly necessary but may be preferred for formality.\nTranslation 3: \"Chart 12 retail bank performance\" is similar to Translation 1 but uses the singular \"bank\" instead of \"banks.\" This may be misleading if the chart refers to multiple banks.\nTranslation 4: \"Chart 12 Retail Banking Performance\" is similar to Translation 2 but omits the colon. While still understandable, the colon is a standard convention for separating the chart number from the title.\nTranslation 5: \"Chart 12 Retail Banking Performance\" is identical to Translation 4 and suffers from the same issue.\nTranslation 6: \"Chart 12: Performance of Retail Banks\" is well-structured, using a colon and the phrase \"Performance of Retail Banks,\" which is grammatically correct and clear. However, it uses the plural \"banks\" which may not be the best fit if the chart refers to the retail banking sector in general rather than individual banks.\nConsidering these points, the best approach would be to use a colon to separate the chart number from the title, use the singular \"banking\" to refer to the sector, and include the word \"the\" for formality. The phrase \"Performance of Retail Banking\" is more natural and concise than \"Performance of Retail Banks\" when referring to the sector as a whole.\nTherefore, the improved translation would be: \"Chart 12: Performance of Retail Banking.\"\n\nChart 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Rate Gaps\nThe original text is \"圖 13 零售銀行淨息差.\" The dictionary provides several options for translation, and the goal is to select the most appropriate terms while ensuring fluency and accuracy.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Chart 13 Retail Bank Net Interest Rate Gaps\" – This translation uses \"Retail Bank\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less common than \"Retail Banking\" in financial contexts. It also uses lowercase \"bank\" which may be inconsistent with the title case expected in chart headings.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"Chart 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Rate Gaps\" – This is a strong translation. It uses \"Retail Banking\" which is a standard term in financial terminology and \"Net Interest Rate Gaps\" is an accurate translation of \"淨息差.\" The title case is appropriate.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Chart 13 retail bank net interest rate gaps\" – This translation is grammatically correct but uses all lowercase, which is not typical for chart titles. It also uses \"retail bank\" instead of \"retail banking,\" which is less standard in this context.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"Chart 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Rate Gaps\" – Identical to Translation 2, which is a good sign of consistency.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Chart 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Rate Gaps\" – Same as Translation 2 and 4, showing strong agreement among some junior translators.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"Chart 1 retail bank net interest rate gaps\" – This translation has a critical error: it uses \"Chart 1\" instead of \"Chart 13.\" It also uses lowercase and \"retail bank\" instead of \"retail banking.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Chart 13\" as specified in the original text, use \"Retail Banking\" as it is the most standard term in financial contexts, and use title case for the chart title. \"Net Interest Rate Gaps\" is the correct translation for \"淨息差\" as per the dictionary. The use of \"Chart 13\" ensures accuracy, and \"Retail Banking\" is more appropriate than \"Retail Bank\" in this context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nChart 13 Retail Banking Net Interest Rate Gaps\n\nChart 14: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and currency markets operated smoothly and orderly. Supported by substantial inflows of stock-related funding, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee being triggered multiple times. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, fully demonstrating its strong resilience against shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy as maintaining currency stability.\n- The term \"Currency Board\" is consistently used for \"發行局,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The range of 7.75 to 7.85 is accurately translated in all versions.\n- The structure of the monetary system and the mechanism of the Currency Board are generally well conveyed.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"making the exchange rate... remain within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars for 1 US dollar.\" The phrase \"for 1 US dollar\" is awkward and unclear.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"rates of change\" for \"增減,\" which is not the best fit. \"Adjustments\" or \"changes\" would be more natural.\n- **Translation 4** incorrectly uses \"most support\" instead of \"100% support,\" which is a critical error given the dictionary specifies \"100%.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100 percent,\" which is redundant and less fluent than \"fully matching.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"HK dollars\" instead of \"Hong Kong dollars\" or \"HK$\" as per the dictionary options, which is less formal and less precise.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"Currency Board\" for \"發行局\" and \"100%\" for \"最少百分之百.\"\n- \"Support\" should be used as per the dictionary, not \"backing\" or \"rates of change.\"\n- The phrase \"remain within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar\" is more natural than \"for 1 US dollar.\"\n- \"Fully matching\" is more concise and natural than \"100% in line with.\"\n- \"Monetary Base\" should be capitalized as per the dictionary and context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. The monetary system primarily adopts the Currency Board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support to the Monetary Base; if the Monetary Base changes, the US dollar reserves must also make corresponding adjustments, fully matching the changes in the Monetary Base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:\n- Liability Certificates (providing full support for banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)\n- Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds issued on behalf of the Government by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\nThe original text is a simple title: \"表 1 貨幣基礎,\" which translates to \"Table 1 Monetary Base.\" All junior translators have provided the same translation, which is accurate and appropriate. The term \"表\" is correctly translated as \"Table,\" and \"貨幣基礎\" is accurately rendered as \"Monetary Base,\" which is a standard term in economics and finance. The numeral \"1\" is correctly translated as \"1.\"\nThe translation is concise, fluent, and adheres to the dictionary guidelines. There is no ambiguity or grammatical error. The term \"Monetary Base\" is the most appropriate choice from the dictionary options for \"貨幣基礎,\" as it is a well-established term in financial contexts. The use of \"Table\" for \"表\" is also appropriate, as it is the most direct and commonly used translation.\nNo improvements are necessary, as the translation is already optimal.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars at a rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at a rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar), causing the aggregate balance to increase (or decrease), leading to a decline (or rise) in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2020 Year Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\nThe junior translators have all correctly identified the key terms \"匯率\" and \"穩定\" and translated them as \"exchange rate\" and \"stability,\" respectively. However, their translations vary in formatting and capitalization, which affects the overall presentation and readability of the text.\nThe first, second, sixth, and third translators provided the phrase \"exchange rate stability\" with minor differences in capitalization. The fourth and fifth translators included the \"#\" symbol, which may be intended to denote a heading or section title but is not part of the original Chinese text. The fifth translator also capitalized \"Rate\" in \"Exchange Rate Stability,\" which is inconsistent with standard English usage unless it is a proper noun or title.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the phrase should be presented in a clear, consistent, and natural manner without unnecessary symbols or inconsistent capitalization. \"Exchange rate stability\" is the most natural and standard translation, with \"exchange rate\" in lowercase unless it is part of a title. Given that the original text appears to be a heading or title, it may be appropriate to capitalize it as \"Exchange Rate Stability\" if that is the intended format. However, since the original text does not include any formatting, the most neutral and accurate translation would be \"exchange rate stability.\"\n\nWith the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in March, risk-averse sentiment led global investors to increase their holdings of US dollars, causing a noticeable tightening of USD liquidity conditions. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by the same period USD interest rates, and the tightening of USD liquidity led to a tightening of Hong Kong's monetary conditions. Although the US Federal Reserve subsequently implemented liquidity programs, which eased some of the pressure on USD liquidity, Hong Kong's monetary conditions remained relatively tight due to stock-related demand and quarter-end effects. With strong demand for HKD, combined with the positive interest rate differential between HKD and USD stimulating carry trade activities, the HKD exchange rate leaned toward the strong-side exchange rate guarantee (Chart 1), which was eventually triggered in April. Subsequently, robust new share fundraising activities, along with southbound capital inflows under the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" and \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" drove equity-related capital inflows, keeping the HKD rate close to the 7.75 level and leading to multiple triggers of the strong-side exchange rate guarantee throughout 2020. The strong-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, resulting in cumulative capital inflows of HK$383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nChart 1 2020 Market Exchange Rate\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate in most parts. However, it incorrectly uses \"HK$383.5 billion\" instead of \"HK$3,835 billion\" and \"HK$457.5 billion\" instead of \"HK$4,575 billion.\" These errors significantly affect the numerical accuracy. The term \"discount window operations\" is used correctly, and the dictionary terms like \"strong-side exchange guarantee\" and \"Exchange Fund Bills\" are appropriately translated.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the correct version. It uses \"HK$3,835 billion\" and \"HK$4,575 billion\" correctly. However, it uses \"11,330 billion HKD\" instead of \"HK$11,330 billion,\" which is slightly inconsistent in formatting. The term \"Convertibility Undertaking\" is not used, and \"strong-side exchange guarantee\" is used instead, which is acceptable but not the exact term from the dictionary.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of dictionary usage, using \"Convertibility Undertaking\" and \"Monetary Base\" correctly. However, it uses \"repurchase window activities\" instead of \"discount window activities,\" which is a minor but notable deviation. The numerical values are correct, and the translation is fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has significant numerical errors, using \"HK$1,133 billion\" instead of \"HK$11,330 billion\" and \"HK$1,526.6 billion\" instead of \"HK$15,266 billion.\" These errors are critical and would mislead the reader. The term \"Convertibility Undertaking\" is used correctly, and the translation is otherwise fluent.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has severe numerical errors, using \"HK$113.3 billion\" and \"HK$152.66 billion\" instead of the correct figures. It also uses \"exchange guarantee\" instead of \"Convertibility Undertaking.\" The translation is otherwise fluent but suffers from major inaccuracies.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of numerical values and dictionary usage. It correctly uses \"Convertibility Undertaking\" and \"discount window activities.\" The translation is fluent and adheres closely to the original text.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the correct numerical values, adhere to the dictionary terms, and maintain fluency and accuracy. Based on the above review, the sixth junior translator's version is the most accurate, with correct numerical values and appropriate use of dictionary terms. However, minor adjustments can be made to enhance clarity and consistency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe total reserves (before conducting discount window activities) and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds increased from HK$11,330 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$15,266 billion at the end of 2020 (Chart 2). In response to requests from banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sold a total of HK$3,835 billion as the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused global macroeconomic volatility, and in order to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA gradually reduced the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds by a total of HK$20 billion in late April and early May 2020. Due to the triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds, the total reserves (before conducting discount window activities) increased from HK$543 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$4,575 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds decreased slightly from HK$10,787 billion during the year to HK$10,692 billion, reflecting the reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds, which offset the usual practice of absorbing interest on outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds through new issuances of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds. The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2: Aggregate Surplus (Prior to Conducting Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\nThe original title, \"圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券,\" is a financial or economic chart title that requires precise and professional translation. The junior translators have made various attempts, but several issues remain.\nTranslation 1 uses \"total balances\" and \"conducting transfer window activities.\" While \"transfer\" is not the best match for \"貼\" (which should be \"discount\" in this context), the structure is clear.\nTranslation 2 is incomplete and omits key elements like the time frame and the pre-activity condition.\nTranslation 3 is the most accurate so far, using \"Aggregate Surplus\" and \"Discount Window Activities,\" which are appropriate financial terms. However, it omits the year \"2020.\"\nTranslation 4 uses \"Aggregate Outstanding\" and \"Ahead of Discount Window Activities,\" which is somewhat confusing and lacks clarity.\nTranslation 5 is very close to the correct version, using \"Aggregate surplus at the end of 2020\" and \"Discount Window Activities.\" However, \"surplus\" may not be the best term for \"總結餘\" in this context.\nTranslation 6 uses \"Total Balance\" and \"Discount Window Activities,\" which is accurate, but again omits the year \"2020.\"\nThe best approach is to combine the strengths of these translations, ensuring that all key terms are correctly translated and that the structure is clear and professional. The term \"總結餘\" should be translated as \"Aggregate Surplus\" or \"Aggregate Balance,\" and \"貼現窗活動\" should be \"Discount Window Activities.\" The year \"2020\" should be included, and the phrase \"進行...前\" should be \"Prior to Conducting...\" to maintain the correct temporal relationship.\nThus, the final translation should be:\nChart 2: Aggregate Surplus (Prior to Conducting Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds in 2020\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the Lunar New Year holiday, liquidity demand receded, and Hong Kong interbank interest rates generally declined in February (Chart 3). In March, due to USD funding pressure, along with local factors such as new share fund-raising and quarter-end funding requirements, Hong Kong interbank interest rates temporarily rose. Subsequently, as the strong-side exchange guarantee was triggered and the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills decreased, leading to an increase in aggregate surplus, the liquidity situation for Hong Kong dollars gradually eased.\n\nIn response to the two reductions in the US Federal Funds Rate target range in March, as well as reflecting changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) during the year, the basic interest rate fell from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at the end of the year. At the retail level, despite the reduction in the US Federal Funds Rate target range, banks maintained their Best Lending Rates unchanged. Overall, Hong Kong's currency market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending decreased from HK$383 billion in 2019 to HK$91 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3: 2020 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\nThe original text is a title for a chart, and as such, it should be concise and follow standard English title conventions. The junior translators have mostly captured the essential elements, but there are variations in structure and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is the most fluent and grammatically correct, using the standard format for chart titles: \"Chart 3: 2020 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs).\" It correctly uses the term \"Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\" from the dictionary and places the year after the location, which is standard in English titles.\nTranslation 2 is awkward due to the placement of \"2020 year\" and the lack of a colon, making it less readable.\nTranslation 3 uses \"interbank interest rates\" instead of \"Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\" and omits the year placement after the location, which is less standard.\nTranslation 4 is similar to Translation 3 but uses \"Interbank Interest Rates\" instead of \"Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs),\" which is less precise.\nTranslations 5 and 6 are identical and follow the correct format, but they are slightly less precise than Translation 1 in terms of clarity and standard title structure.\nThe best possible translation should follow the standard format for chart titles, use the exact term from the dictionary, and ensure clarity and fluency. Therefore, the improved translation is:\nChart 3: 2020 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a key pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating strong resilience against shocks. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the stability and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Throughout the year, in the face of some baseless rumors questioning the Linked Exchange Rate System and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly reiterated to the public that Hong Kong will continue to implement the Linked Exchange Rate System, while the free flow of funds and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also published several articles elaborating on the fact that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to demonstrate strong resilience against shocks even in adverse conditions. The government is also firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets, as well as the continued normal use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value, reflect the effectiveness of the aforementioned measures in maintaining public confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in its “2020 External Sector Report” that Hong Kong has transparent rules, ample financial and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System. Despite the negative impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hong Kong banking system has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels being very ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintaining supervision over bank lending. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also provided more liquidity to the banking system to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established a series of liquidity arrangements for banks. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has maintained contact with banks to ensure they can utilize these liquidity arrangements during times of tension. In response to the volatility and uncertainty factors brought about by the coronavirus pandemic in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced temporary USD liquidity arrangements to provide USD liquidity support to licensed banks, which helps alleviate the liquidity tightness in the global USD interbank lending market.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board's accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without touching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 109.9% on December 31 (Chart 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's deep pool of financial resources, together with Hong Kong's sound banking system, provide a strong backing for the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system.\n\nChart 4 Daily Change in Support Ratio in 2020\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. The first translation, \"Chart 4 2020 Support Ratio Daily Change,\" is concise but lacks clarity in the placement of \"Daily Change,\" which could be misinterpreted as referring to the chart itself rather than the data it represents. The second translation, \"Chart 4 2020 year Support Ratio Daily Change,\" incorrectly uses \"2020 year\" instead of \"2020\" or \"2020 year\" as a standalone term. The third translation, \"Chart 4 2020 year support ratios daily changes,\" is grammatically correct but uses lowercase \"support ratios\" and \"daily changes,\" which may not be ideal for a title. The fourth translation, \"Chart 4 Daily Changes in 2020 Support Ratio,\" is well-structured but places \"Daily Changes\" before the year, which may not be the most natural phrasing. The fifth translation, \"Chart 4 2020 year supporting ratio daily changes,\" incorrectly uses \"supporting ratio\" instead of \"support ratio\" and also uses lowercase for \"daily changes.\" The sixth translation, \"Chart 4 Daily Change in Support Ratio in 2020,\" is the most natural and grammatically correct, with proper capitalization and structure.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the title should clearly indicate that it is a chart, the year in question, the subject of the chart (support ratio), and the nature of the data (daily change). The use of \"Daily Change in Support Ratio in 2020\" is the most natural and clear phrasing, with proper capitalization and structure. The term \"Support Ratio\" is correctly used, and \"Daily Change\" accurately reflects the meaning of \"每日變動.\" The placement of \"in 2020\" at the end of the title is also appropriate, as it provides context for the data being presented. The use of \"Chart 4\" at the beginning of the title is also correct, as it identifies the specific chart being referenced. Overall, the sixth translation is the most accurate and natural, and it should be used as the basis for the final translation.\n\n# Other Affairs\n\nThe Currency Board, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and exploring issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2020, the topics discussed by the Currency Board included scenario analysis of Hong Kong's economy, assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border capital flows, and understanding the Hong Kong interbank market. The minutes of the Currency Board meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are all available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nUnder the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Institute) was still able to maintain a certain number of research outputs in 2020. In 2020, the Institute published a total of 20 research papers, covering a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking sector stability, market microstructure, and fintech development. Some of these papers have been accepted or are currently under review for publication in professional journals. Due to the implementation of social distancing and travel restrictions during the pandemic, the Institute's main activities, including seminars, lectures, and visiting research programs, had to be postponed. The Institute will resume these aforementioned activities once public health and tourism conditions return to normal.\n\n# Notes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation (referring to banknotes issued by note-issuing banks) was HK$559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year (Charts 5, 6, and 7). The total value of government-issued banknotes and coins in circulation was HK$12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous year (Charts 8 and 9). Among government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HK$10 banknotes in circulation was HK$4.6 billion, of which 79% were polymer banknotes.\n\nChart 5: Breakdown of Banknote Circulation Amount by Issuing Bank at the End of 2020\nChart 5: Analysis of Circulating Amount of Banknotes by Issuing Bank at the End of 2020\nChart 5 2020 end of the year analysis of banking sector banknotes amounts in circulation.\nChart 5 end-2020 amounts of banknotes in circulation analysed by bank.\nChart 5: Value of banknotes in circulation by issuing bank at the end of 2020\nChart 5: Breakdown of Banknote Circulation Amount by Issuing Bank at the End of 2020\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. The first and fifth translations are concise and accurate, using appropriate terms such as \"Chart 5\" and \"at the end of 2020.\" However, they lack the term \"analysis\" which is present in the original text. The second and sixth translations correctly include \"analysis\" and \"breakdown,\" respectively, which aligns with the dictionary's options for \"分析.\" The third translation is overly wordy and awkwardly structured, while the fourth translation is grammatically correct but lacks clarity in its phrasing.\nThe best possible translation should incorporate the term \"analysis\" or \"breakdown\" as per the dictionary, use \"Chart 5\" as the title, and ensure that the phrase \"at the end of 2020\" is used for \"年底.\" Additionally, the term \"banknotes\" should be used for \"紙幣\" and \"in circulation\" for \"流通.\" The term \"amount\" is more appropriate than \"value\" in this context, as it refers to the quantity of banknotes in circulation rather than their monetary worth.\nChart 5: Breakdown of Banknote Circulation Amount by Issuing Bank at the End of 2020\n\nChart 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nChart 7: Value of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nChart 8: Government Issuance of Notes and Coins in Circulation at the End of 2020\nChart 8: Government Issuance of Notes and Coins in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nChart 9: Analysis of Government Issuance of Notes and Coins in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nFollowing the launch of new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 new banknote series are now in circulation. The series features more robust and user-friendly security features, and has been well received by the public, gradually replacing the old version of banknotes.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to hold lectures introducing the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA organized eight lectures (including online sessions), enhancing public understanding of Hong Kong banknotes and attracting over 2,000 people, including bank counter staff, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme was launched in October 2014 and continued to be widely popular throughout the year. It is the world's first systematic mobile coin collection programme, featuring two coin collection carts that rotate stops across all 18 districts of Hong Kong. Each cart is equipped with two high-speed coin counting machines, allowing citizens to choose to exchange coins for banknotes or use them to top up stored value payment tools such as the Octopus card or electronic wallets, or to deposit the money into the Community Chest donation boxes inside the carts. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority collaborated with the Council of Social Service to deploy coin collection carts to collect coins during non-governmental organisation flag days. The carts also visit schools to enhance students' understanding of the coin collection programme. Over the years, the programme has received numerous local and international awards, recognising its innovative and environmentally friendly approach to handling coins.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

brought about by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the banking sector in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2020. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding flexibly. It continued to focus its regulatory efforts on credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. Given the ongoing increase in cyber threats and the rising trend of the use of financial technology in the banking industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority strengthened its supervision of technology risk management and operational soundness of authorized institutions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also closely collaborated with banks and international organizations to facilitate the transition of the industry to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides authorized institutions with flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements and offers guidance, in order to assist banks in their business operations during the pandemic and continue providing services to customers, while also ensuring the protection of investors and consumers. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with relevant authorities, has formulated the implementation details for the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program and consulted the industry. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority collaborates with the Securities and Futures Commission to provide guidance on streamlining the sales procedures for family offices and high net worth investors who are experienced in financial matters. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened the protection of consumers of digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly took action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can assist authorized institutions in more effectively responding to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continues to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including increasing the number of authorized institutions participating in public-private partnerships for information sharing, as well as supporting the banking sector's adoption of compliance technology. The HKMA also aligns with international trends in the development and application of technology and data, initiating further initiatives to strengthen its supervisory capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has closely cooperated with the banking industry to optimize regulatory policies and procedures, as well as to implement measures aimed at enhancing the professional capabilities of talent. Hong Kong has made ideal progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase plan and is currently formulating relevant regulatory rules. The HKMA is also continuing to strive to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible authorized institution resolution mechanism, including the formulation of new resolution standards and the implementation of rules regarding the capacity to absorb losses, in order to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this objective, it is essential to establish and maintain a financial system with high capacity to cope with challenges and provide the essential financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking sector due to their operational methods, or even in extreme situations due to disorderly failures. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Management Commissioner plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover from them to ultimately help prevent failures. The Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Financial Management Commissioner is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the financial regulator cannot ensure the financial system is entirely without risk, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime is also not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution mechanism authorities, the financial regulator strives to ensure that once an authorized institution is no longer sustainable in operation, its collapse can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the financial regulator serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and establish the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts methods consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n# 2020 Year Review\n\n# Regulatory Oversight Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 186 non-on-site reviews in 2020, covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies. To continue strengthening the risk governance levels of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 30 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of authorized institutions, and held 30 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to non-on-site reviews, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site inspections, complemented by thematic assessments to review areas identified as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA conducted a total of 610 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus on credit risk management as one of the main priorities in its reviews and assessments. Another key focus was operational and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, a dedicated review team conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite facing the pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains regulatory oversight and makes flexible arrangements, flexibly and effectively fulfilling its regulatory functions, including providing flexibility in submitting reports and conducting on-site reviews; strengthening data collection to supplement on-site reviews, as well as using online meeting platforms.\nDespite facing the pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains regulatory oversight and makes flexible arrangements, flexibly and effectively fulfilling its regulatory functions, including providing flexibility in submitting reports and conducting on-site reviews; strengthening data collection to supplement on-site reviews, as well as using online meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 contains an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1 Regulatory Work Summary\n\n# Credit Risk Oversight\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe original text is a heading, likely from a financial report or document. The dictionary provides specific translations for the terms \"信貸\" (credit), \"增長\" (growth), and \"資產質\" (asset quality). All junior translators have correctly used the dictionary terms, translating \"信貸\" as \"Credit,\" \"增長\" as \"Growth,\" and \"資產質\" as \"Asset Quality.\"\nHowever, there are variations in capitalization and punctuation. The first and fourth translations use lowercase for \"growth\" and \"quality,\" while the second, third, fifth, and sixth use title case. The third and sixth translations include a hashtag (#) at the beginning, which may be appropriate if the heading is intended for social media or a digital platform. The fifth translation mixes title case and lowercase for \"asset quality,\" which is inconsistent.\nThe best translation should maintain consistency in capitalization and punctuation. Since the original text is a heading, it is appropriate to use title case for each major word. Including a hashtag may be optional depending on the context, but it is not necessary for a standard heading. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is \"Credit Growth and Asset Quality\" without a hashtag and with consistent title case.\n\nThe total amount of loans increased by 1.2% in 2020, while the increase in 2019 was 6.7%. Table 2 provides the growth situation of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2 Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of Mainland-related loans slightly decreased by 0.2% to HK$455.3 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Mainland-related Loan Growth\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical accuracy, and precise use of terminology.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構\" and \"specific classified loan ratio\" for \"特定分類貸款比率.\"\n- The use of \"deteriorated\" for \"轉差\" and \"solid\" or \"sound\" for \"穩健\" is appropriate.\n- The translations accurately reflect the percentages and time references, such as \"since 2000\" and \"a year ago.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The phrase \"Throughout the year\" or \"Within years\" in some translations is awkward or incorrect. \"During the year\" is more natural.\n- The use of \"still remaining\" in one translation is grammatically incorrect; \"remains\" is more appropriate.\n- Some translations use \"in terms of\" or \"regarding\" inconsistently, which affects fluency.\n- The term \"Mainland-related loans\" is correctly used, but \"loans related to Mainland China\" is more precise and natural in context.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"During the year\" consistently for \"年內.\"\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement, such as using \"remains\" instead of \"remain.\"\n- Use \"regarding\" or \"in terms of\" consistently for \"方面.\"\n- Use \"loans related to Mainland China\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nAffected by the novel coronavirus pandemic, the asset quality of authorized institutions has slightly deteriorated. During the year, the specific classified loan ratio in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90%, remaining at a solid level, far below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding loans related to Mainland China, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% a year ago to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the uncertainties related to the novel coronavirus pandemic, which have brought significant challenges to the economy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has conducted a thorough review of the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess the trend of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has strengthened its oversight of large borrowers and industries more vulnerable in the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposure at both the industry and borrower levels. The HKMA's special stress test analysis shows that banks have the capacity to withstand the economic pressures brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducting a thematic assessment to evaluate credit risk management practices of authorized institutions across several loan categories. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"special assessment\" and correctly translating \"Mainland-related loans\" and \"secured loans.\" However, it omits the term \"within the year\" and uses \"review\" instead of \"assess,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation uses \"within years,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"risk management approaches\" instead of \"credit risk management methods,\" which is slightly off. The term \"Mainland-related\" is used correctly.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"within the year\" and \"secured loans.\" It correctly uses \"credit risk management methods\" and \"Mainland-related loans.\" However, it omits \"interbank loans\" and \"private banks\" in favor of \"private banking,\" which is slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less precise. It uses \"credit risk management approaches\" and \"secured loans\" correctly. However, it omits \"within the year\" and uses \"customers\" instead of \"clients.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"within the year,\" \"credit risk management approaches,\" and \"Mainland-related loans.\" It correctly includes \"interbank loans\" and \"private banks\" and uses \"clients\" appropriately.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but uses \"thematic assessment\" instead of \"special assessment,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"mortgage loans\" instead of \"secured loans,\" which is a misinterpretation. The term \"private banking\" is used instead of \"private banks,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" as per the dictionary, include \"within the year,\" use \"credit risk management methods\" or \"approaches\" as appropriate, and accurately reflect \"Mainland-related loans,\" \"interbank loans,\" and \"secured loans.\" It should also use \"private banks\" and \"wealth management clients\" as specified.\n**Improved Translation:**\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a special assessment to review the credit risk management methods of authorized institutions across different areas, including Mainland-related loans, interbank loans, and secured loans to private banks and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to relieve customers' pressure on cash flow\nThe original Chinese title, \"# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施,\" translates to \"Measures to relieve customers' pressure on cash flow.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first and second translations are identical: \"Measures to relieve customers' funding turnover pressure.\" While this is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning, \"funding turnover pressure\" is somewhat awkward and not commonly used in English business contexts. \"Funding turnover\" is not a standard term, and \"pressure\" is vague without specifying the nature of the pressure.\nThe third translation, \"Measures to Relieve Customers' Financial Pressure,\" is more concise and natural. However, it omits the nuance of \"資金周轉\" (funding turnover), which refers specifically to the flow or circulation of funds, not just general financial pressure.\nThe fourth translation, \"Measures to relieve customers' pressure on cash flow,\" is the most accurate and natural. It correctly captures the meaning of \"資金周轉\" as \"cash flow\" and uses \"pressure on\" to convey the idea of strain or burden. This is a fluent and idiomatic expression in English business writing.\nThe fifth translation, \"Measures to provide relief from customers’ financing pressure,\" is also fluent but slightly off in meaning. It suggests that the measures are providing relief to customers from their own financing pressure, which misrepresents the original intent. The original text refers to measures taken to relieve the pressure on customers, not the customers providing relief to themselves.\nThe sixth translation, \"Measures to relieve customer funding strain,\" is concise and natural. However, \"funding strain\" is less common than \"cash flow pressure\" in English business contexts, and \"customer\" is singular, which may not match the plural \"客戶\" in the original text.\nBased on this review, the best translation would be \"Measures to relieve customers' pressure on cash flow.\" It accurately reflects the original meaning, uses natural and idiomatic English, and adheres to the dictionary terms provided. \"Cash flow\" is the most appropriate translation for \"資金周轉,\" and \"pressure on\" effectively conveys the burden or strain being relieved.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism (Coordination Mechanism) in October 2019. The mechanism introduced multiple rounds of relief measures to assist enterprises and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers' financing needs in line with prudent risk management principles. The most significant measure was the \"Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday\" scheme launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May. Under the scheme, all eligible enterprise customers could defer principal repayments on their loans for six months. After being extended for another six months in November, the scheme was further extended for another six months until the end of October 2021. Approximately 100 banks participated in the scheme, covering 120,000 eligible enterprise customers. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of enterprise loan deferrals and other support measures, involving an amount exceeding HK$740 billion.\nFor individual customers, banks also introduced a residential mortgage \"Principal Payment Holiday\" scheme, which included related mortgages under the \"Home Ownership Scheme.\" In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in sectors severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan terms, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage \"Principal Payment Holiday\" and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount exceeding HK$44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\nThe original text is \"# 物業按揭貸款,\" which translates to \"Property Mortgage Loan.\" The junior translators have mostly captured the correct terminology, but there are some nuances to consider.\nThe first junior translator used \"Property mortgage loans,\" which is grammatically correct but uses the plural form \"loans\" without clear justification, as the original text does not indicate multiple loans.\nThe second, fourth, and fifth junior translators used \"Property Mortgage Loan,\" which is accurate and maintains the singular form, aligning with the original text's structure. However, the use of uppercase \"Loan\" is inconsistent with standard English capitalization unless it's part of a title.\nThe third junior translator used \"Mortgage loan,\" which omits \"property\" and thus loses the specificity of the term \"物業\" (property). This is a significant omission, as \"property\" is crucial in the context of real estate financing.\nThe sixth junior translator used \"# Property Mortgage Loan,\" which includes the hashtag symbol. This is unnecessary unless the text is intended for social media or a specific platform that uses hashtags, which is not indicated in the original text.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation should be \"Property Mortgage Loan,\" using the singular form to match the original text's structure and including \"property\" to maintain the specificity of the term. The use of lowercase \"loan\" is appropriate unless the term is part of a title or heading. The hashtag should be omitted unless it is explicitly required for the context.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"resilience\" for \"抵禦\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" for \"成數.\" However, \"cope with\" is slightly less precise than \"withstand\" or \"resilience\" in the context of banking systems.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"enhanced the resilience\" and \"debt-to-income ratio\" appropriately. It also correctly uses \"Hong Kong banking sector\" for \"銀行體.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"stand at\" instead of \"was\" for consistency with the original text.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and uses \"resilience\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" correctly. However, it uses \"launched\" for \"推出\" and \"newly approved\" for \"新批出,\" which are acceptable but not the most precise in context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is good but slightly less precise. It uses \"address the risk of a sudden downturn\" instead of \"withstand a sudden reversal,\" which is less direct. It also uses \"rolled out\" for \"推出,\" which is acceptable but not the most natural in this context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"enhanced the resilience\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" correctly. It also uses \"newly issued\" for \"新批出,\" which is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"rose\" instead of \"increased,\" which is slightly less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"resilience\" and \"loan-to-value ratio\" correctly. It also uses \"debt service-to-income ratio\" for \"供款與入息比率,\" which is more precise than \"debt-to-income ratio.\" However, it uses \"upper limit\" for \"上限,\" which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"cap.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"resilience\" for \"抵禦\" as it is the most natural and precise term in this context.\n- Use \"loan-to-value ratio\" for \"成數\" consistently.\n- Use \"introduced\" for \"推出\" as it is the most natural and formal term in this context.\n- Use \"newly issued\" for \"新批出\" as it is the most precise and formal term.\n- Use \"debt service-to-income ratio\" for \"供款與入息比率\" as it is the most precise and formal term.\n- Use \"cap\" for \"上限\" as it is the most natural and formal term in this context.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures since 2009, which have strengthened risk management in banks and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a sudden reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly issued residential mortgages was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% in September 2009 before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly issued residential mortgages increased in 2020, mainly due to a higher proportion of mortgages involving mortgage insurance, which typically have higher loan-to-value ratios. The average debt service-to-income ratio for newly issued mortgages also remained at a low level, at 37% in December, compared to 41% in August 2010 when the cap for this ratio was first introduced (Chart 1).\n\nConsidering the price trends and transaction volumes of non-residential properties, the economic outlook, and external environment factors, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures for non-residential property mortgages in August, increasing the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap for such loans by 10 percentage points. The cap for general cases was raised from 40% to 50%.\n\nChart 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio of New Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\nChart 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio of New Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Business Activities and Technological Risks\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented a series of measures to minimize the impact of the pandemic on the operations of banking businesses. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to safeguard the health of employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority reminded authorized institutions to strengthen communication with employees and customers, prepare for situations where confirmed cases may occur in their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more challenging but potentially occurring risk scenarios. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained close contact with the industry and urged authorized institutions to remain vigilant, regularly reviewing their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments of the pandemic and the government's social distancing measures.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of the dictionary terms. However, it uses \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative\" consistently, which is correct, but it omits the abbreviation \"CFI\" which appears in the original text. Also, \"eTradeConnect\" is not used for \"易\" as per the dictionary, which is a minor error.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in structure and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. It includes the full name and abbreviation for the initiative, which is good. However, it uses \"Banking Association\" instead of \"HKAB\" as specified in the dictionary, which is a minor deviation.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"CFI\" and \"HKAB\" correctly as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" instead of \"Cybersecurity Fortification Assessment Framework,\" which is a minor inconsistency.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has several errors. It incorrectly uses \"HKAB\" instead of \"HKMA\" and uses \"eTradeConnect\" for \"易,\" which is not correct. It also has a grammatical error with \"submit[ted]\" and incorrectly translates \"易\" as \"eTradeConnect.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses the dictionary terms correctly, including \"HKMA\" and \"HKBA.\" It also uses \"CFI\" and \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative\" appropriately. However, it uses \"HKBA\" instead of \"HKAB\" as per the dictionary, which is a minor issue.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"CFI\" and \"HKAB\" correctly. However, it uses \"assessment framework\" instead of \"assessment framework\" (no difference), and \"qualified accreditation list\" instead of \"credentials certification list,\" which is a minor deviation.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should use the dictionary terms accurately, maintain the structure and meaning of the original text, and ensure fluency and natural English. It should use \"CFI\" and \"HKAB\" as per the dictionary, avoid incorrect substitutions like \"eTradeConnect\" for \"易,\" and ensure that all terms are translated consistently.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0 (CFI 2.0)\" in November after completing a comprehensive review and extensive industry consultation on the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI).\" In response to the latest international robust practices in overseas cyber risk management, the CFI 2.0 further enhances the CFI. Among the updates, the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Assessment Framework\" under the CFI incorporates the latest international robust practices regarding cyber incident response and recovery. In terms of the \"Professional Training Programme\" under the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" the scope of the qualification certification list has been expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas regions. The HKMA also submitted several recommendations to the Hong Kong Banking Association (HKAB) to make the \"Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform\" more user-friendly. The \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0 (CFI 2.0)\" took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nAfter reviewing the six translations, the following observations can be made:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations accurately convey the core message of the original text, including the completion of virtual banks' operations, the use of innovative technology, and the incorporation of gamification elements.\n- The term \"FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\" is consistently translated, and the dictionary terms such as \"貸款\" (loan), \"客戶\" (customer), and \"遊戲\" (games) are generally well-handled.\n- The use of \"virtual banks\" and \"innovative technology\" is consistent and natural.\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and fluent, with minimal grammatical errors.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"have already commenced operations within the year\" which is slightly awkward. \"Within the year\" is redundant since the context implies the year in question is 2019.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"are further incorporating games elements\" which is grammatically incorrect. It should be \"further incorporating game elements.\"\n- **Translation 3** uses \"thereby speeding up the loan approval process\" which is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"fixed deposits\" instead of \"regular deposits,\" which is not an exact match for the original term \"定期存款.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"brand-new experience\" which is slightly informal and not the best fit for the context.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"in* the year\" which appears to be a formatting error. Also, \"step up loan approval procedures\" is not the best phrasing for \"加快貸款批核程序.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"have already commenced operations\" without the redundant \"within the year.\"\n- Ensure \"game elements\" is used consistently and correctly.\n- Use \"regular deposits\" instead of \"fixed deposits\" to match the original term.\n- Use \"speed up the loan approval process\" for clarity and conciseness.\n- Avoid informal expressions like \"brand-new\" in favor of \"new\" or \"innovative.\"\n- Ensure correct grammar and phrasing, such as \"incorporating game elements\" and \"to speed up the loan approval process.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nAfter undergoing rigorous testing and trials in the \"FinTech Regulatory Sandbox,\" all eight virtual banks granted banking licenses in 2019 have already commenced operations. Virtual banks leverage innovative technology to provide customers with a new experience, such as using big data analysis for credit assessment of SME loans to speed up the loan approval process. To strengthen customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks have incorporated game elements into their regular deposit and reward program services.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nThe HKMA launched a series of measures in April to ensure the interbank market and banking sector continue to operate smoothly during the pandemic. These measures include clarifying the operational details of the \"HKMA Liquidity Arrangement\" and introducing a temporary USD liquidity arrangement, and reiterating the flexibility for authorized institutions to use liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted exercises with authorized institutions to ensure they are prepared to use these measures when needed.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

text is a concise title: \"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\". The goal is to translate it into a natural and fluent English title that accurately reflects the meaning and tone of the original.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **\"Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre\"** – This is a strong and natural translation. It uses \"status\" from the dictionary and correctly applies \"international financial centre.\" The structure is fluent and appropriate for a title.\n2. **\"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\"** – This is similar to the first translation but with \"Status\" capitalized. While not incorrect, it may be less natural for a title unless it is part of a larger heading or formal document.\n3. **\"Hong Kong’s International financial centre status\"** – This translation is grammatically awkward due to the lowercase \"financial\" and the placement of \"status.\" It disrupts the flow and readability of the title.\n4. **\"Hong Kong’s international financial centre position\"** – While \"position\" is a valid dictionary option, it is less commonly used in this context. \"Status\" or \"role\" might be more appropriate for describing a city's standing in the global financial landscape.\n5. **\"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status\"** – This is a natural and fluent translation. It uses \"status\" and correctly applies the term \"international financial centre.\" It is very similar to the first translation and is also a strong option.\n6. **\"# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\"** – This translation is almost correct, but the use of the hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary unless it is part of a specific formatting requirement. It may be confusing or out of place in a standard title.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and grammatically correct. It should also use the most appropriate term from the dictionary. \"Status\" is the most natural and commonly used term in this context, and \"international financial centre\" is the correct translation for \"國際金融中心.\"\nThe first and fifth translations are both excellent, but the fifth is slightly more concise and avoids the use of \"as,\" which is not necessary in a title. The hashtag in the sixth translation is unnecessary and should be omitted.\n**Improved Translation:**\nHong Kong’s international financial centre status\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial centre. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has taken various measures to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment sectors. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" saw significant growth during the year.\n\nHong Kong is situated at a strategic position in the opening-up of the Mainland's financial markets, enabling it to fully capitalise on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class financial market infrastructure, including the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect,\" Hong Kong is not only a highly favoured fundraising platform for Mainland enterprises, but also a window for international investors to enter the rapidly growing Mainland market. This year has seen good progress in promoting financial cooperation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents' use of financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively opening up new opportunities and enhancing Hong Kong’s financial platform, including asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and the competitiveness of sustainable finance areas. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthens market promotion, promoting Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. On a global level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a leading role in a number of regional and international committees, fully highlighting Hong Kong’s professional expertise and commitment in relevant international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment sectors. Major progress this year includes:  \n- Promoting wider adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);  \n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement open application programming interfaces (open APIs);  \n- Connecting the trade financing platform \"Trade Connect\" with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to promote the digitalization of trade financing;  \n- Researching the application of central bank digital currency in cross-border payments;  \n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Commercial Data Connect\" and researching new types of credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) obtain financing;  \n- Publicly announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a larger and more diverse compliance technology (RegTech) ecosystem, further promoting the application of RegTech;  \n- Strengthening talent development; and  \n- Advancing cross-border fintech cooperation.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is accurate in terms of structure and terminology, but it incorrectly identifies the FFO as part of the \"Financial Services and Technology Promotion Office\" and the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" as \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau.\" These are not consistent with the original text or standard terminology.\n2. **Translation 2** misidentifies the FFO as part of the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau,\" which is not mentioned in the original text. It also uses \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" which is incorrect.\n3. **Translation 3** introduces \"Financial Services and Development Council,\" which is not present in the original text. It also adds unnecessary details like \"banks\" to \"various departments,\" which is not supported by the original.\n4. **Translation 4** correctly identifies the FFO as part of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and uses \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" for \"FFO.\" However, \"facilitate\" is not the best match for \"促進\" in this context, and \"various departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is slightly awkward.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate and concise. It correctly identifies the FFO as part of the HKMA and uses \"collaborates with the various banking departments of the HKMA,\" which is a natural and fluent expression.\n6. **Translation 6** is nearly identical to Translation 5 and is also accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"collaborates with the various banking departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"playing a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\"\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately reflect the original structure and meaning.\n- Use the correct terminology from the dictionary.\n- Be fluent and natural in English.\n- Avoid unnecessary additions or alterations not present in the original.\nBased on the above, **Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, with only minor adjustments needed for clarity and consistency with the dictionary.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fintech Promotion Office (FFO) collaborates with the various banking departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, playing a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include Mainland onshore securities or increase their weightings, the inflow of funds into renminbi assets continues to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned, leveraging its connections to the Mainland capital markets through the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect,\" playing a key role in encouraging international investors to increase their allocation of renminbi assets. In 2020, the average daily transaction value of \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching approximately 19.3 billion renminbi. To enhance the operation of \"Bond Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced new measures, including the establishment of a special settlement period service, extending trading hours, and introducing new arrangements to provide investors with greater flexibility in choosing banks for currency exchange and foreign exchange hedging. Following the successful implementation of the Northbound component of \"Bond Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority formed a working group with the People's Bank of China to study the framework for the Southbound component.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), People's Bank of China, and Macao Financial Authority.\n- Most translations use the correct term \"cross-border\" for \"跨境\" and \"Wealth Management Connect\" for \"理財通.\"\n- The term \"financial infrastructure measures\" is well used in several translations to reflect \"金融配套措施.\"\n- The phrase \"real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system\" is accurately translated in most versions.\n- The use of \"position\" or \"status\" for \"地位\" is appropriate, especially in the context of \"global offshore renminbi business hub.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"cross-boundary\" instead of \"cross-border,\" which is less standard in financial contexts.\n- The term \"Liquidity Channel\" in the fifth translation is incorrect for \"理財通\"; the correct term is \"Wealth Management Connect.\"\n- The sixth translation incorrectly uses \"trillions of renminbi\" instead of \"1.2 trillion renminbi,\" which is a factual error.\n- Some translations use \"flexibilities\" instead of \"flexibility\" or \"room,\" which is less precise.\n- The phrase \"financial measures\" is used in some translations, which is less accurate than \"financial infrastructure measures\" for \"金融配套措施.\"\n- The term \"Mainland\" is used inconsistently, sometimes with a capital \"M\" and sometimes not, which affects readability.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements should be made:\n- Use \"cross-border\" consistently for \"跨境.\"\n- Use \"Wealth Management Connect\" for \"理財通.\"\n- Use \"financial infrastructure measures\" for \"金融配套措施.\"\n- Use \"flexibility\" or \"policy space\" for \"政策空間.\"\n- Ensure \"Mainland\" is consistently capitalized.\n- Use \"1.2 trillion renminbi\" for \"1.2萬億元人民幣.\"\n- Use \"position\" or \"status\" for \"地位.\"\n- Ensure the term \"real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system\" is used correctly.\nBased on this reasoning, here is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to be committed to strengthening financial infrastructure measures between Hong Kong and Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have publicly announced a series of policy measures to support financial development in the region. In June, the People's Bank of China, the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority of Macao (Macao MA) jointly announced the decision to implement the cross-border \"Wealth Management Connect.\" The HKMA has been working closely with Mainland and local authorities, as well as industry stakeholders, to formulate the implementation details. The HKMA also maintains contact with Mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand policy flexibility for Hong Kong banks to broaden the scope of their cross-border business activities. Throughout the year, Hong Kong has continued to maintain its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub. The average daily transaction amount of Hong Kong's renminbi real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of 1.2 trillion renminbi.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for \"地位\" (status\/position), \"稅務\" (tax), \"加強\" (strengthen\/step up), \"市場\" (market), \"競爭力\" (competitiveness), \"綠色\" (green), \"更\" (more\/further), \"持份者\" (stakeholders), \"業務\" (business), \"基金\" (fund), \"發展\" (development), \"與及\" (and), \"香港\" (Hong Kong), \"監管\" (regulatory), \"工作\" (work), \"金融\" (financial), \"為\" (to), \"平台\" (platform), \"外\" (overseas), \"政府\" (government), \"亦\" (also), \"環境\" (environment), \"推廣\" (promotion), \"同時\" (at the same time), \"機遇\" (opportunities), \"金\" (Payments), \"合作\" (cooperation), \"提升\" (enhance), \"業界\" (industry), \"區內\" (regional), \"作為\" (as), \"開拓\" (opening up), \"入\" (inflow), \"新\" (new), \"可持續\" (sustainable), \"樞紐\" (hub), \"緊密\" (closely), \"內地\" (Mainland), \"繼續\" (continue), \"服務\" (service), \"本地\" (local), and \"大\" (large).\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"footnote\" for \"地位\" (position), which is not ideal in this context. It also uses \"step up\" for \"加強\" (strengthen), which is acceptable but less formal than \"strengthen.\"\n- **Translation 2** is fluent and uses \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"step up\" for \"加強,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"HKMA\" consistently, which is good, but the phrase \"for funds to establish a presence locally\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"establish locally\" without a preposition, which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"has also invested significant efforts\" which is slightly passive.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"establish in Hong Kong\" which is redundant since the context is about local establishment. It also uses \"outside\" for \"外\" which is less precise than \"overseas.\"\n- **Translation 5** is very close to the best version, using \"status\" for \"地位\" and \"step up\" for \"加強.\" It is fluent and accurate.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"establishing operations locally\" which is slightly wordy. It also uses \"strengthens\" for \"加強\" which is acceptable but less consistent with the other translations.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"status\" for \"地位\" as it is more appropriate in the context of a financial hub.\n- Use \"step up\" for \"加強\" as it is a common and natural expression in this context.\n- Use \"overseas\" for \"外\" to maintain clarity.\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently for brevity and clarity.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural flow in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively opening up new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s fund business, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority closely collaborates with the government and industry stakeholders to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish a local presence. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also devoting significant efforts to continue enhancing Hong Kong’s status as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is stepping up its market promotion efforts to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nIn the field of central banking, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a leading role in various regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA serves as the Chair of the Policy and Standards Working Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and as the Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Meeting (EMEAP). The HKMA also serves as Co-Chair of the Non-Bank Oversight Expert Group under the Financial Stability Board, and as Co-Chair of the Financial Innovation Network. Additionally, the HKMA leads a working group exploring regulatory matters related to the transition of benchmarks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"financial market infrastructure\" and \"system availability rate.\" It correctly uses \"assist in the settlement\" and \"hold mainland debt securities.\" However, \"lay a robust foundation\" is slightly less natural than \"lay a solid foundation.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"financial infrastructure\" and \"settle 'Bond Connect' Northbound transactions.\" It is fluent and accurate, though \"settle\" is slightly more direct than \"assist in the settlement.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"safe and efficient operation\" and \"Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments,\" which is more descriptive than \"Debt Securities Central Settlement System.\" However, \"related CMU system members\" is slightly less natural than \"relevant CMU system members.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has some inaccuracies, such as \"Centralised Money Market Unit settlement system\" and \"Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited depository,\" which are not accurate descriptions of the CMU system or the Hong Kong Repository. It also uses \"northbound\" without quotation marks, which is inconsistent with the original text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent but has some inaccuracies, such as \"Central Moneymarket Unit (CMU) system for debt securities settlement\" and \"Hong Kong Securities Clearing and Settlement System (Hong Kong Depository),\" which are not standard names for the CMU system or the Hong Kong Repository. It also uses \"northbound trading under the Bond Connect,\" which is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"system availability rate\" and \"hold Mainland debt securities on behalf of.\" However, \"Central Movable Property Settlement System\" is incorrect for the CMU system, and \"Northbound Bond Connect transactions\" is slightly less natural than \"Bond Connect Northbound transactions.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"financial market infrastructure\" as it is more precise than \"financial infrastructure.\"\n- Use \"Debt Securities Central Settlement System (CMU system)\" as it is the standard name.\n- Use \"Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository)\" as it is the standard name.\n- Use \"assist in the settlement\" as it is more natural than \"settle.\"\n- Use \"relevant CMU system members\" as it is more natural than \"related CMU system members.\"\n- Ensure that \"Bond Connect\" is enclosed in quotation marks as in the original text.\n- Use \"system availability rate\" as it is the standard term.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe security and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial market infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. In 2020, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Settlement System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository) achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories in the Mainland, the CMU system continues to assist in the settlement of \"Bond Connect\" Northbound transactions and to hold Mainland debt securities for relevant CMU system members.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"registered accounts\" instead of \"registrations,\" which is not ideal. Also, \"doubled compared to 2019\" is slightly ambiguous and could be clearer.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is fluent and grammatically sound. It correctly uses \"registrations\" and \"more than doubling,\" which is more precise than \"doubled.\" It also uses \"major reasons\" and \"in addition to,\" which are appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and well-structured. It uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"transaction value,\" which are appropriate. However, \"increasing more than twice\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation. It uses \"two-fold\" and \"main reasons behind,\" which are natural and precise. It also correctly uses \"the government's acceptance\" and \"peer-to-peer payments.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This version is clear and accurate. It uses \"transaction volume\" and \"by two times,\" which are acceptable. However, \"peer-to-peer payments\" is slightly more informal than \"person-to-person payments.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is very close to the best version. It uses \"two times\" and \"peer-to-peer payments,\" but \"transaction volume\" is slightly less precise than \"transaction value\" in the context of growth.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"轉數快\" should be translated as \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" to ensure clarity and consistency.\n- \"錄得\" should be translated as \"recorded\" or \"registered\" depending on context.\n- \"交易額\" should be translated as \"transaction value\" rather than \"transaction volume\" to reflect the monetary aspect.\n- \"人對人\" should be translated as \"person-to-person\" rather than \"peer-to-peer\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- \"上升兩倍\" should be translated as \"more than doubled\" or \"two-fold increase\" to reflect the correct numerical comparison.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe usage of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. As of the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded, with the annual transaction volume more than doubling compared to 2019. The government's acceptance of FPS for payments and the adoption by more merchants are the main reasons behind the significant growth in transaction value, beyond the steady growth in person-to-person payments.\n\nTo ensure the overall security and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designates and oversees six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 licensed stored value payment tool providers.\n\n# 2020 Year Review\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as Asia’s Fintech Hub\nHong Kong’s Status as Asia’s Fintech Hub\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nSince the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value payment tool operators have joined, with five additional banks and one stored value payment tool operator joining in 2020. FPS usage has also steadily increased. As of December 31, FPS had recorded a total of 6.9 million registrations (Chart 1). To facilitate the public in receiving payments issued by institutions, FPS introduced the use of Hong Kong identity card numbers as account identifiers starting December 6. Within less than one month after introducing this feature, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new function is not intended for person-to-person transfers, but solely for institutions with recipients' identity card numbers to issue payments (e.g., salary disbursements). Since each citizen's identity card number is unique, using Hong Kong identity card numbers as account identifiers ensures accurate receipt of payments even without providing bank account numbers.\n\nChart 1: Number of FPS Account Registrations\nThe original title \"圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\" translates to \"Chart 1: Number of Faster Payment System Account Registrations.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1: \"Chart 1: Number of Registered FPS Accounts\" is clear and grammatically correct, but \"Registered FPS Accounts\" may be slightly ambiguous, as it could imply that the accounts themselves are registered rather than the registrations.\nTranslation 2: \"Chart 1 Faster Payment System Account Registrations Number\" is awkward in structure and lacks proper punctuation, making it less readable.\nTranslation 3: \"Chart 1: Faster Payment System Account Registered Number\" is grammatically incorrect and awkward, as \"Registered Number\" is not a standard phrase.\nTranslation 4: \"Chart 1 FPS account registered number\" is concise but lacks proper capitalization and punctuation, and the phrase \"registered number\" is not standard in this context.\nTranslation 5: \"Chart 1: Number of FPS Account Registrations\" is the most fluent and natural, accurately conveying the meaning of the original title. It uses \"FPS\" as a standard abbreviation for \"Faster Payment System\" and correctly places \"registrations\" to indicate the count of registration events.\nTranslation 6: \"Chart 1 FPS account registered number\" is similar to Translation 4, with the same issues of punctuation and phrasing.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be \"Chart 1: Number of FPS Account Registrations,\" as it is grammatically correct, fluent, and accurately reflects the original meaning. It uses the appropriate abbreviation \"FPS\" and places the term \"registrations\" correctly to indicate the count of registration events.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Faster Payment System\" and \"FPS\" as alternatives for \"轉數快.\" The structure is clear and the numbers are correctly translated. However, \"reached 505,000 instant transactions\" could be more precise by specifying \"instant transactions\" as \"immediate transactions.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"underpinned\" for \"受惠,\" which is a good choice. The use of \"which is three times...\" is slightly more natural than \"which was three times...\" in this context. The only minor issue is the use of \"RMB 95 million\" instead of \"RMB 95 million\" (though both are acceptable).\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"Figure 2\" instead of \"Chart 2,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable. However, it incorrectly translates \"涉及52億港元\" as \"HK$52 billion\" instead of \"HK$5.2 billion.\" This is a significant error that affects the accuracy of the data.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation has several issues. It uses \"10 of the first month\" instead of \"the volume in the first month,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"950 million renminbi\" instead of \"95 million RMB,\" which is a numerical error. The phrase \"which is 3 times the 168,000 transactions\" is awkwardly phrased.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" and \"RMB 95 million.\" The structure is clear and the numbers are correctly translated. The use of \"progressively extended\" is a good choice for \"逐步擴展至.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"novel coronavirus\" for \"新冠,\" which is a valid alternative. The use of \"has since expanded\" is a good choice for \"逐步擴展至.\" However, it uses \"HKD 52 billion\" instead of \"HK$5.2 billion,\" which is a numerical error.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct numerical values and terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the natural flow of the English language while preserving the meaning and nuance of the original Chinese text. Based on the above review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the first, second, and fifth junior translators, while correcting the numerical errors and ensuring consistency in terminology.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have brought new momentum to the use of electronic payment services. The volume of Faster Payment System (FPS) transactions grew particularly rapidly during the year (Chart 2), with the average daily transaction volume reaching 505,000 immediate transactions in December 2020 (involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million), equivalent to three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, and ten times the volume in the first month of FPS launch in October 2018. The increased use of FPS also benefited from the gradual expansion of its application scope, initially mainly used for person-to-person payments, and progressively extended to bill payments (including government bills), retail, and commercial payments.\n\nChart 2: Average Daily Transaction Figures for Immediate HK$ Payments\nThe original title, \"圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字,\" is a concise label for a chart depicting the average daily transaction figures for immediate HK$ payments. The junior translators have produced several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1: \"Chart 2: HK$ Immediate Payment Average Daily Transaction Figures\" is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary term \"HK$\" appropriately. However, the placement of \"Immediate Payment\" before \"Average Daily Transaction Figures\" is slightly awkward and less natural in English.\nTranslation 2: \"Chart 2 HK$ immediate payment average daily transaction figures\" lacks punctuation and capitalization, making it less formal and harder to read. It also places \"immediate payment\" before \"average daily transaction figures,\" which is not the most natural phrasing.\nTranslation 3: \"Chart 2 Hong Kong dollar immediately payment averaged daily transaction figures\" uses \"immediately\" instead of \"immediate\" and \"averaged\" instead of \"average,\" which are not the best choices in this context. It also uses \"Hong Kong dollar\" instead of the more concise \"HK$.\"\nTranslation 4: \"Chart 2 Hong Kong dollar immediate payment average daily transaction figures\" is grammatically correct and uses \"HK$\" appropriately. However, \"Hong Kong dollar\" is more verbose than necessary and less commonly used in financial contexts compared to \"HK$.\"\nTranslation 5: \"Chart 2: Average Daily Transaction Figures for Immediate HKD Payments\" uses \"HKD\" instead of \"HK$\" and places the phrase in a more natural order. However, \"HKD\" is less common in this context than \"HK$.\"\nTranslation 6: \"Chart 2: Average daily transaction figures for immediate HK$ payments\" is the most natural and fluent of the translations. It uses \"HK$\" correctly, places the phrase in a logical order, and maintains proper capitalization and punctuation.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should use \"HK$\" as the currency symbol, place the phrase in a natural English order, and maintain proper capitalization and punctuation. The most refined version would be: \"Chart 2: Average Daily Transaction Figures for Immediate HK$ Payments.\" This translation is concise, grammatically correct, and uses the appropriate terminology from the dictionary.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been collaborating with multiple government departments and the banking sector to expand the application scope of the Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant transactions. Since November 2019, the Government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote its use and provide convenience for the public. Citizens can use mobile banking apps or e-wallets supporting FPS to scan QR codes printed on bills, enabling them to easily pay taxes, Rating, land rent, water charges, and general payment notices issued by the Government. As of December 2020, 1.8 million transactions had been made via FPS to pay government bills, involving HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four additional government departments began accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service machines starting from December 21, 2020. The Government is also exploring arrangements for adopting FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is that an increasing number of small and large merchants are adopting the Faster Payment System (FPS) to strengthen their business operations. Merchant payment transactions surged significantly in December 2020, reaching an average of 100,000 daily transactions, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is widely used for paying bills, direct deductions within applications, and other online shopping activities. The growing popularity of electronic wallets has also driven a significant increase in the volume of transactions involving FPS for account value-added services. The average daily volume of value-added transactions in December 2020 was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo strengthen public awareness of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced various educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of smart usage tips provided on social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a secondary school WhatsApp Sticker Design Competition to increase students' understanding of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA promoted the use of FPS for making and receiving payments among a number of charitable organizations and market operators. Several banks and stored value payment tool operators participating in FPS also launched promotional activities, including offering incentives to attract customers to register and use FPS for fund transfers and bill payments. Building on the achievements of 2020, the HKMA collaborated with banks and stored value payment tool operators in early 2021 to promote the electronic distribution of e-laisee via FPS. On one hand, the HKMA launched promotional campaigns, while on the other hand, banks and stored value payment tool operators provided incentives to encourage customers to distribute e-laisee electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helps in the fight against the pandemic.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n# Open Application Programming Interface\nThe translations provided by the junior translators have several strengths and weaknesses. The most notable issue is the inconsistent use of the term \"程式\" (programming), which should be translated as \"Application Programming Interface\" according to the dictionary. However, in translations 1, 3, and 4, \"Application Programming Interface\" is used correctly, while translation 6 incorrectly uses \"Application Interface.\" Translation 5 omits the word \"Open\" entirely, which is a critical part of the original text.\nThe use of the hashtag \"#\" in translations 2, 4, and 6 is questionable, as it is not present in the original text and may not be appropriate in this context. The term \"應\" is translated as \"to\" in the dictionary, but it is not present in the original text, so it does not affect the translations.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Open Application Programming Interface,\" which accurately reflects the original text and uses the correct term from the dictionary.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the banking industry's development and provision of open APIs in accordance with the open API framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, and banks have already launched Phase I and Phase II open APIs, collaborating with third-party service providers to open up various innovative services and enhance customer experience. On the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is conducting research on the implementation of Phase III and Phase IV open APIs and published a booklet in November containing the survey results.\n\n# Trade Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nTo enable importers and exporters to obtain more convenient trade financing services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority initiated a proof-of-concept study during the year to explore the connection between \"Trade Link\" and the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, and the pilot program was subsequently launched. Hong Kong and Mainland China banks have successfully completed multiple cross-border trade financing transactions using this connection.\n\n# Cross-border Payment\nThe original text is a simple title: \"# 跨境支付\". The dictionary provides two options for \"支付\" (payment\/pay) and two for \"跨境\" (cross-boundary\/cross-border). All junior translators have correctly used \"cross-border\" for \"跨境\" and \"Payment\" or \"payment\" for \"支付\". However, there are minor differences in capitalization and punctuation.\nThe first and fourth translations use lowercase \"payment\" and \"cross-border payment\", which may be less appropriate for a title. The second, third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Cross-border Payment\" with proper capitalization, which is more suitable for a title.\nThe best translation should follow title case conventions, using \"Cross-border Payment\" as it is the most consistent with standard English title formatting. It also uses the most appropriate term from the dictionary for both \"跨境\" and \"支付\".\n\nIn the provided translations, several strengths and weaknesses are evident. All translations accurately convey the core message of the original text, which discusses the joint research between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand on central bank digital currency (CBDC) applications in cross-border payments. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\nStrengths include the use of \"central bank digital currency (CBDC)\" as a standard term, the inclusion of \"blockchain-based cross-border corridor network,\" and the accurate translation of \"synchronous settlement\" or \"simultaneous settlement\" for \"同步交收.\" The translations also correctly use \"Phase I\" and \"Phase II\" for \"第一階段\" and \"第二階段,\" respectively, and \"foreign exchange transactions\" for \"外匯交易.\"\nWeaknesses include inconsistent use of \"cross-boundary\" instead of \"cross-border,\" which is not the preferred term in financial contexts. Some translations use \"International Settlement Bank\" instead of \"Bank for International Settlements (BIS),\" which is an incorrect name. Additionally, \"Digital Currency Research Institute\" is used in some translations, while the dictionary lists \"Digital Currency Institute\" as the correct term for \"數字貨幣研究所.\"\nThe best translation would maintain consistency with the dictionary, use \"cross-border\" instead of \"cross-boundary,\" and ensure the correct names for institutions. It should also use \"Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\" and \"Digital Currency Institute\" as specified in the dictionary.\nBased on this review, the improved translation is as follows:\nIn the area of central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues joint research with the Bank of Thailand to explore the application of CBDC in cross-border payments, aiming to promote the simultaneous settlement of Hong Kong dollar and Thai baht foreign exchange transactions between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. Both parties have completed the first phase of the research and published a joint report in January outlining the main research findings. They have also developed a prototype of a cross-border corridor network based on blockchain technology, striving to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and reduce costs. Phase II of the project has commenced, aiming to explore commercial applications in cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks have also shown strong interest in the project. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China announced their participation in the project at the beginning of 2021.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

translates to \"Reserves Management\" in English. The dictionary provides multiple options for \"儲備\" (Reserves, Reserve, reserves) and \"管理\" (management, managing, governance, manage, manager, managed). \nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are some inconsistencies in capitalization and formatting. The first and sixth translations use \"Reserve Management\" with \"Reserve\" capitalized, which is less common in formal titles. The second, fourth, and fifth translations use \"Reserves Management\" with \"Reserves\" capitalized, which is more appropriate for a formal title. The third translation is identical to the first but without the hashtag.\nConsidering the context and the dictionary options, \"Reserves Management\" is the most appropriate translation. It uses the plural form \"Reserves\" which is more commonly used in formal contexts, and \"Management\" is the most suitable translation for \"管理\" in this context. The hashtag \"#\" is also included in the original text, so it should be retained in the translation.\nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is \"Reserves Management\".\n\n2020 was a year of twists and turns, as the novel coronavirus pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After experiencing sharp adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, asset markets rebounded rapidly under the support of ultra-loose monetary policies introduced by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments around the world. Due to major central banks significantly lowering benchmark interest rates and restarting quantitative easing measures, sovereign bond yields fell sharply, while bond prices rose. In this investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, with a return rate of 5.3%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre. The HKMA is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, based on the delegated authority and terms of delegated authority granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# The original text is \"# 外匯基金的管理,\" which translates to \"Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\" or similar variations. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the terms \"基金,\" \"管理,\" and \"外匯,\" and the junior translators have used these to varying degrees of success.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"Management of the Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Exchange Fund\" from the dictionary for \"外匯基金\" and \"management\" for \"管理.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitted the hashtag \"#\" and the title format. Also, \"Exchange Fund\" may be more specific than intended, as \"外匯基金\" could be more generally translated as \"foreign exchange fund.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# Management of the Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes the hashtag and uses \"Exchange Fund\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation, \"Exchange Fund\" may be too specific, and the title is not fully capitalized.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"The Management of Exchange Fund.\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Management\" and \"Exchange Fund\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrect capitalization and punctuation. The phrase \"Exchange Fund\" is still potentially too specific.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"Management of the Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation—omits the hashtag and uses \"Exchange Fund\" instead of \"foreign exchange fund.\"\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"Foreign exchange fund management\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"foreign exchange fund\" from the dictionary and \"management\" for \"管理.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag and title format. Also, the phrase is not capitalized and is in a different structure.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"management\" and \"foreign exchange fund\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag and title format. Also, \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is more specific than \"外匯基金\" might imply.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Include the hashtag \"#\" as in the original.\n- Use \"foreign exchange fund\" for \"外匯基金\" (as it is more general and matches the dictionary).\n- Use \"management\" for \"管理.\"\n- Follow proper title capitalization and punctuation.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:  \n(a) To safeguard capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;  \n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained to preserve monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek the highest possible investment returns, subject to compliance with the aforementioned (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal statement about how certain objectives align with the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and asset allocation. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate and fluent, but there are subtle differences in word choice and tone that affect the overall quality.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use \"statutory purposes\" for \"法定目的\" and \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\"\n- The use of \"portfolio structure\" for \"組合結構\" and \"target asset allocation\" for \"目標資產配置\" is consistent and appropriate.\n- The phrase \"have been reflected in\" accurately captures the meaning of \"並已反映.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, fifth, and sixth translations use \"fully take into account,\" which is slightly more formal and repetitive than \"comprehensively take into account\" or \"comprehensively consider.\"\n- The third and fourth translations use \"comprehensively take into account\" and \"comprehensively consider,\" respectively, which are more varied and natural in tone.\n- The fourth translation uses \"the Exchange Fund’s portfolio structure,\" which is slightly more concise and natural than \"the portfolio structure of the Exchange Fund.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- To enhance fluency and avoid repetition, \"comprehensively consider\" or \"comprehensively take into account\" could be used instead of \"fully take into account.\"\n- The possessive form \"the Exchange Fund’s portfolio structure\" is more natural in English than \"the portfolio structure of the Exchange Fund.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the Exchange Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Exchange Fund\" and use \"portfolios\" for \"組合.\"\n- The term \"Currency Board\" is consistently used for \"發行局,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"highly liquid\" or \"high liquidity\" is used for \"極高流通性,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"OECD\" is used in several translations, which is a recognized abbreviation for \"經濟合作與發展組織.\"\n- The translations all capture the purpose of the \"支持組合\" and \"投資組合\" accurately.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"Support Portfolio\" and \"Investment Portfolio\" with capitalization, which may be inconsistent with the original text's tone.\n- The term \"Monetary Base\" is used in some translations, which is a direct match for \"貨幣基礎\" from the dictionary, but it should be used consistently.\n- The phrase \"in accordance with the Currency Board System\" is used in some translations, while others use \"in accordance with the regulations of the Currency Board system.\" The latter is more precise.\n- Some translations use \"bond and stock markets\" while others use \"debt and stock markets.\" \"Debt markets\" is more precise for \"債市.\"\n- The term \"provision\" or \"provide\" is not consistently used for \"提供,\" though the translations mostly use \"provide\" or \"providing,\" which is acceptable.\n- The phrase \"to safeguard the value of assets and long-term purchasing power\" is used in some translations, while others use \"to protect the value of assets and long-term purchasing power.\" \"Safeguard\" is more aligned with the dictionary's \"保障.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent terminology, especially for terms like \"Currency Board,\" \"Monetary Base,\" and \"OECD.\"\n- Use \"safeguard\" for \"保障\" as it is more aligned with the dictionary and conveys a stronger sense of protection.\n- Use \"debt markets\" for \"債市\" to be more precise.\n- Use \"in accordance with the regulations of the Currency Board system\" for clarity and precision.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, consistent with financial terminology.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two major portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support to the Monetary Base in accordance with the regulations of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio mainly invests in the debt and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has adopted a prudent and phased approach to allocate part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's accumulated surplus, plus the total amount of future fund deposits and deposits from Exchange Fund affiliated companies that are linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which the Government purchased for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund accounts. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: Uses \"regularly\" for \"不時\" which is slightly off; \"不時\" is more accurately \"occasionally\" or \"from time to time.\" Also uses \"key example\" for \"主要個別例子,\" which is somewhat awkward. The translation is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: Uses \"occasionally\" for \"不時,\" which is better. \"Major individual example\" is still awkward. The use of \"portfolio weightings\" is appropriate. The translation is fluent and accurate.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Similar to the second, with \"portfolio weightings\" and \"weightings of the Future Fund.\" The phrasing \"the weightings of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio\" is slightly awkward but understandable.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: Uses \"occasionally\" and \"portfolio weighting.\" The use of \"Reserves\" and \"Government\" with capital letters is inconsistent with the dictionary, which allows lowercase. The phrase \"the Future Fund’s weighting in the investment portfolio\" is more natural.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Uses \"regularly\" again, which is not ideal. \"Portfolio composition\" is not the best term for \"組合比重.\" The rest is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"from time to time\" for \"不時,\" which is accurate. \"Major individual example\" is still awkward. The use of \"Growth\" with a capital letter is inconsistent with the dictionary. The phrase \"weighting between the investment portfolio\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- \"不時\" should be translated as \"from time to time\" or \"occasionally.\"\n- \"主要個別例子\" should be translated as \"a major example\" or \"a principal example,\" avoiding \"individual.\"\n- \"組合比重\" should be \"portfolio weightings\" or \"proportions of the portfolios.\"\n- \"法定組織\" should be \"statutory organisations\" or \"statutory bodies.\"\n- \"財政儲備\" should be \"financial reserves.\"\n- \"政府基金\" should be \"government funds.\"\n- \"未來基金\" should be \"Future Fund.\"\n- \"長期增長組合\" should be \"long-term growth portfolio.\"\n- \"約\" should be \"approximately\" or \"about.\"\n- \"40：60\" should be \"40:60.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from time to time from financial reserves, government funds, and statutory organisations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major example. The interest rate on deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate determined by the weightings of the portfolios. The Future Fund’s weighting in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio is approximately 40:60.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they exhibit some inconsistencies and errors that need to be addressed for a polished final version. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: The dictionary provides specific translations for certain terms, and it is crucial to ensure that these are used correctly. For example, \"戰略性偏離\" should be translated as \"tactical deviations\" (not \"strategic deviation\" as in Translation 5), and \"司長\" should be \"FS\" (not \"Financial Secretary FS\" as in Translation 1). Similarly, \"獲利\" should be \"advantage\" (not \"profit\" or \"gain\" as in some translations).\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Some translations are more fluent than others. Translation 3 and 4 are particularly smooth in their phrasing and sentence structure. However, some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"to gain advantage from short-term market changes\" (Translation 1), which is less natural than \"to gain advantage from short-term market fluctuations\" or \"to profit from short-term market movements.\"\n3. **Cultural and Institutional Appropriateness**: The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"HKMA\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), not \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Payments\" as in some translations. Also, \"財政司司長\" should be \"Financial Secretary (FS)\" consistently, not \"FS\" alone or \"Financial Secretary FS.\"\n4. **Consistency in Terminology**: There is inconsistency in the use of terms like \"戰略性\" and \"策略性.\" According to the dictionary, \"策略性\" is \"strategic\" and \"戰略性\" is \"tactical.\" However, Translation 5 incorrectly uses \"strategic deviation\" instead of \"tactical deviation.\"\n5. **Clarity and Precision**: Some translations use vague or imprecise language. For example, \"the difference between actual and benchmark allocation is called 'tactical deviations'\" (Translation 1) is more precise than \"the gap between actual and benchmark allocation is called'strategic deviation'\" (Translation 5), which is factually incorrect.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should:\n- Use the dictionary terms accurately.\n- Maintain consistent terminology.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and natural phrasing.\n- Reflect the institutional and cultural context appropriately.\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through the investment benchmark, meaning the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline, and through tactical asset allocation, it seeks to obtain returns in excess of the benchmark. Therefore, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary (FS), after consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, formulates the investment benchmark and sets the tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviations to gain advantage from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the \"Exchange Fund Investment Office\" as the subject, using the dictionary term \"Investment Office.\"\n- The term \"dedicated\" is consistently used for \"專責,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The percentage \"約72%\" is translated as \"approximately 72%\" or \"about 72%,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"support portfolio\" is used in several translations, which is a valid translation of \"支持組合.\"\n- The term \"derivatives\" is used for \"衍生工具,\" which is correct.\n- The phrase \"macro risk management strategy\" is used consistently and accurately.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"execute\" for \"執行,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"implement\" or \"carry out\" in this context.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"supported portfolio\" instead of \"supporting portfolio,\" which may mislead the reader.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"supporting portfolio,\" which is more accurate, and \"implements\" for \"執行,\" which is appropriate.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"execute\" again and omits \"the\" before \"Exchange Fund's investments,\" which is grammatically incorrect.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is redundant and not in line with the dictionary.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"investment\" instead of \"investments\" for \"投資,\" which is singular and incorrect in context. It also uses \"derivatives tools\" instead of \"derivative instruments.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The term \"Exchange Fund\" should be used consistently, as per the dictionary, and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is redundant.\n- \"Supporting portfolio\" is more accurate than \"supported portfolio\" for \"支持組合.\"\n- \"Implement\" or \"carry out\" is more natural than \"execute\" for \"執行.\"\n- \"Derivative instruments\" is more precise than \"derivatives tools.\"\n- \"Investments\" should be used in plural form for \"投資.\"\n- The phrase \"global fixed-rate market investments\" is more natural than \"investments in various global fixed-rate markets.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund's Investment Office is dedicated to investment and related risk management functions. The office's staff members are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio includes various global fixed-rate market investments, and derivative instruments are used to implement the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy.\n\n# External Investment Manager\nThe original text is \"# 外聘投資經理\". The dictionary provides specific translations for the terms \"外聘\", \"投資\", and \"經理\". \"外聘\" should be translated as \"external\", \"投資\" can be translated as \"investment\", and \"經理\" as \"manager\". \nThe translations provided by the junior translators mostly follow the correct structure, but there are some inconsistencies in capitalization and formatting. The best translation should be \"External Investment Manager\" with proper capitalization and without unnecessary symbols like the \"#\".\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, to realize sustainable returns, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Translation 1** uses \"related expenses\" and \"primarily influenced by market factors.\" It is grammatically correct and fluent, but \"primarily influenced by\" is slightly less natural than \"primarily affected by.\"\n2. **Translation 2** uses \"hiring an external investment manager\" and \"mainly vary from year to year.\" The phrase \"vary from year to year\" is slightly wordy compared to \"vary each year\" or \"vary year by year.\"\n3. **Translation 3** uses \"depository fees\" instead of \"custody fees,\" which is incorrect based on the dictionary. \"Custody\" is the correct term for \"託\" in this context. It also uses \"year by year,\" which is acceptable but less concise than \"each year.\"\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"custodian fees\" and \"expenditures\" instead of \"expenses.\" While \"expenditures\" is a valid synonym, \"expenses\" is more commonly used in financial contexts. It also uses \"each year,\" which is natural.\n5. **Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 4, with the exception of using \"hiring\" instead of \"employing.\" Both are acceptable, but \"employing\" may be slightly more formal and appropriate in a financial context.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to Translation 5, using \"expenditures\" and \"primarily affected by.\" It is grammatically correct and fluent.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- \"Employing\" is more formal and appropriate in a financial context than \"hiring.\"\n- \"Expenses\" is more commonly used in financial contexts than \"expenditures.\"\n- \"Custody fees\" is the correct translation for \"託\" in this context, not \"depository\" or \"custodian.\"\n- \"Primarily affected by\" is more natural than \"primarily influenced by.\"\n- \"Vary each year\" is more concise and natural than \"vary from year to year\" or \"vary year by year.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use \"expenses,\" \"custody fees,\" \"primarily affected by,\" and \"vary each year.\"\n**Final Translation:**\nExpenses related to employing external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily affected by market factors and vary each year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary guidelines. All translations correctly use \"Risk Management\" for \"風險管理\" and \"Oversight\" for \"監察,\" which are appropriate choices from the dictionary options. The only variation lies in capitalization and the presence of the \"#\" symbol.\nThe first, second, sixth, and third translations use \"Risk Management and Oversight\" with proper capitalization, which is suitable for a title. The fourth and fifth translations use lowercase, which may be more appropriate for a subtitle or body text but less so for a heading. The use of \"#\" in the second and sixth translations is consistent with the original text's formatting, which includes a \"#\" symbol before the title.\nThe best translation would maintain the original formatting, use proper title capitalization, and ensure consistency with the dictionary terms. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is:\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, and the importance of risk management is self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance regime. The HKMA has implemented a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and oversight. The HKMA also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks), and has strengthened risk management procedures to support the diversified investment strategy of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment by incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund's public and private markets.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary entries appropriately, such as \"HKMA,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" \"Responsible Investment,\" and \"ESG.\"\n- Most translations maintain the formal tone and structure of the original text, which is appropriate for a regulatory or financial document.\n- The translations generally convey the core message of the original text, including the HKMA’s principles for ESG assessment, the role of external investment managers, and the monitoring processes in place.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistencies in terminology:** Some translations use \"Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) Regulatory Authority\" or \"Securities and Futures Affairs Supervision Committee,\" which are not accurate. The correct term from the dictionary is \"Surveillance Committee\" or \"Audit Sub-Committee,\" but the original text refers to the \"證券及期貨事務監察委員會,\" which is the \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\"\n- **Fluency and naturalness:** Some translations are overly literal, leading to awkward phrasing, such as \"the implementation of different ESG aspects\" or \"the management of supervisory activities.\"\n- **Use of \"Responsible Investment\":** While \"Responsible Investment\" is a standard term, it should be used consistently and in line with the dictionary, which includes \"Responsible Investment\" as an option.\n- **\"Post-appointment monitoring program\" vs. \"post-employment monitoring program\":** The term \"後\" should be translated as \"post-appointment\" in this context, not \"post-employment.\"\n- **\"Implementation of proxy voting\":** The term \"落實\" should be translated as \"implementation\" or \"execution,\" but \"implementation of proxy voting\" is more natural than \"implementation of proxy voting and communication.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should be fluent, natural, and consistent with the dictionary terms.\n- It should use \"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)\" instead of incorrect variations.\n- It should avoid overly literal translations and ensure that the flow of the text is smooth and professional.\n- It should use \"Responsible Investment\" consistently and in the correct context.\n- It should use \"post-appointment\" instead of \"post-employment\" for \"後.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities of Exchange Fund investment projects. Regarding the asset portfolios managed by external investment managers, the HKMA implements Responsible Investment through appointed investment managers. In the process of selecting, appointing, and overseeing external investment managers, the HKMA evaluates their implementation of ESG across different areas, including the organisational structure for ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment procedures, and the management oversight activities, such as proxy voting and communication with portfolio companies (e.g., discussing ESG matters with the management of portfolio companies). To highlight its emphasis on Responsible Investment, the HKMA promotes more refined ESG practices through the role played by external investment managers in management oversight. External investment managers responsible for managing the HKMA’s Hong Kong equity portfolio and Mainland China active equity portfolio are required to commit to complying with the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" issued by the Securities and Futures Commission, and must provide explanations if unable to comply. As for external investment managers responsible for managing equity portfolios in developed markets, they are required to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA has embarked on a post-appointment monitoring programme to review the implementation of proxy voting and communication with portfolio companies by external investment managers.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"internal personnel\" and \"strengthened\" appropriately. However, it uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" which is not in the original text, making it slightly inaccurate.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation has grammatical issues, such as \"stepping up the weight\" (should be \"increasing the weight\") and \"strengthen related analysis\" (should be \"strengthen the related analysis\"). It also uses \"Sources\" with a capital \"S\" inconsistently.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"internal staff\" and \"increasing the weight\" correctly. It also uses \"the related analysis will be strengthened\" which is grammatically sound.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"internal personnel\" and \"the related analysis is strengthened.\" However, it adds \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" which is not in the original text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"internal staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (though the original does not specify the authority, it is a minor addition), \"increasing the weight,\" and \"the related analysis will be strengthened.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is mostly correct but has a minor issue with \"Sources of ESG data\" (should be \"sources of ESG data\") and \"quantitative assessment\" (should be \"quantitative assessments\").\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The original text does not mention \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" so it should be omitted unless it is a known context.\n- \"Internal staff\" is more natural than \"internal personnel\" or \"internal staff members.\"\n- \"Increasing the weight\" is more natural than \"raising the weight\" or \"boosting the weight.\"\n- \"The related analysis will be strengthened\" is grammatically correct and natural.\n- \"Sources of ESG data\" should be lowercase unless it is a proper noun, which it is not.\n- \"Quantitative assessments\" is more natural than \"quantitative assessment.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe fixed-rate investment portfolio managed by internal staff will also incorporate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding the sources of ESG data and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the related analysis will be strengthened.\n\nRegarding ESG investments in the public market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has invested in green, social responsibility, and sustainable bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. In addition, the HKMA has participated in the International Finance Corporation's \"Joint Loan Portfolio Management Program,\" with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, as market supply increased, the HKMA increased its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to expand its ESG bond portfolio through direct investment or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will adopt ESG equity indices as the benchmark for passive investment portfolios, promoting external investment managers to establish investment mandates themed around ESG. In the coming years, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as active ESG investment portfolios and low-carbon-themed investment tools.\n\nIn the area of private equity market investments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of dedicated general partners during the due diligence process. The HKMA's long-term growth portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and has also incorporated warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features into its real estate investment portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to identify projects with sustainable characteristics and will include green certification as a key consideration in its real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG workshops with dedicated general partners to exchange views and experiences on good ESG practices. At the ESG workshop held in November, a group of dedicated general partners exchanged opinions on the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investments. To enhance ESG transparency in private equity market investments, the HKMA has requested dedicated general partners to provide ESG-related information on their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further incorporate these standards into investment processes, including interacting and cooperating with like-minded investors and international organisations. As a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the HKMA shoulders the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in formulating best practices for ESG, promoting other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organisation FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage business and investment decisions based on long-term objectives through workshops and research. The HKMA also participates in the \"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\" and is a member of the \"Central Bank and Supervisors Network for Green Finance\". In addition, the HKMA organises seminars and actively participates in activities organised by the investment industry, sharing and promoting the principles of ESG investing.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"For information on the responsible investment policy framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, please refer to the 'Institutional Social Responsibility' chapter.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" and correctly translates \"一章\" as \"chapter.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" is not a standard term; the dictionary lists \"social responsibility\" and \"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\" as options. \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" is not a direct match and may be misleading.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"Please refer to chapter one, 'Corporate Social Responsibility,' for details regarding the HKMA’s responsible investment policy framework.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" from the dictionary and \"responsible investment.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly adds \"chapter one\" which is not in the original text. Also, \"HKMA\" is acceptable, but \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is more formal and precise.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the Financial Services and Markets Authority’s responsible investment policy framework, please refer to the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" and \"responsible investment.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" This is a critical error.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The framework of the responsible investment policy of the HKMA is detailed in the 'Institutional Social Responsibility' chapter.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"HKMA.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" is not a standard term and not listed as a direct match in the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"For the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's responsible investment policy framework, see 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"Corporate Social Responsibility.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omission of the definite article \"the\" before \"chapter\" and the use of \"see\" instead of \"see the\" is slightly informal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"Regarding the responsible investment policy framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, see Chapter 'Institutional Social Responsibility'.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Again, \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" is not a standard term and not a direct match from the dictionary.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The term **「機構社會責任」** should be translated as **\"Corporate Social Responsibility\"** (from the dictionary options), not \"Institutional Social Responsibility.\"\n- **「金管局」** is **\"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\"**, not \"Financial Services and Markets Authority.\"\n- The phrase **「一章」** should be translated as **\"chapter\"**, not \"chapter one.\"\n- The term **「負責任投資」** should be translated as **\"responsible investment\"** (from the dictionary), not \"responsible\" alone.\n- The structure should be formal and precise, using \"please refer to\" or \"see\" appropriately.\n### Final Translation:\nFor information on the responsible investment policy framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, please refer to the \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" chapter.\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2020\n\nUnder the support of loose monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the major challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, global financial markets rose to high levels by the end of the year. After experiencing sharp adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, global stock markets quickly rebounded, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The US Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16%, making it the best-performing stock index among the seven major industrialized countries in 2020.\n\nIn the bond market, bond yields in major developed countries continued to be under pressure following a significant decline in the first quarter. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell by approximately 100 basis points from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% by the end of the year. Due to a sharp rise in major government bond prices, 2020 saw significant valuation gains from the bond market.\n\nIn the currency market, the decline in US interest rates narrowed interest rate gaps, prompting the US dollar to weaken against major currencies. This situation became more pronounced in the second half of 2020, with the euro and renminbi appreciating against the US dollar by approximately 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2020.\n\nTable 1 2020 Market Returns\n\n# The Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core information of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Exchange Fund as the subject and use the term \"strategic asset portfolio\" as per the dictionary.\n- The use of \"HK$\" and numerical values is consistent across translations, with most using \"billion\" appropriately for \"億.\"\n- The term \"valuation gains\" is used effectively in several translations, aligning with the dictionary's \"valuation\" and \"gains.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly uses \"HK$2,358 billion\" instead of \"HK$235.8 billion,\" which is a critical error in numerical representation.\n- **Translation 5** also uses \"2020 year\" instead of \"2020,\" which is redundant and not in line with standard English usage.\n- **Translation 1** uses \"foreign exchange valuation of non-HKD assets\" instead of \"non-Hong Kong dollar assets,\" which is less precise and not in line with the dictionary's \"non-Hong Kong dollar.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"due to upward adjustment in foreign exchange valuation,\" which adds unnecessary causality not present in the original text.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"returns\" consistently, which is acceptable, but \"foreign exchange valuation adjustments for non-Hong Kong dollar assets\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 4** is the most fluent and accurate, using \"returns\" and \"upward valuation adjustment\" correctly, and it avoids unnecessary redundancy.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best translation should use \"investment income\" or \"investment returns\" consistently, as both are acceptable per the dictionary.\n- The term \"non-Hong Kong dollar assets\" should be used instead of \"non-HKD assets\" for clarity and consistency with the dictionary.\n- The phrase \"upward adjustment in foreign exchange valuation\" should be used as in Translation 4, avoiding unnecessary prepositions or causality.\n- The numerical representation should be \"HK$235.8 billion\" and not \"HK$2,358 billion\" as in Translation 5.\n- The term \"strategic asset portfolio\" should be capitalized as \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" if referring to a specific entity, but lowercase is acceptable if it's a general term.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, including HK$92.7 billion in bond investment returns, HK$4 billion in Hong Kong stock investment returns, HK$69.9 billion in other stock investment returns, HK$9.6 billion from the upward valuation adjustment of non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HK$59.6 billion in returns from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund’s investment holdings. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded valuation gains of HK$14 billion.\n"}

金管局員工\n\n金管局是政府架構的一部分，但按非公務員條款聘請員工，吸引具適當經驗及專門知識的人才。金管局聘用、培訓及維持一支專業優秀的工作團隊，以履行政策目標及靈活應對工作要求的轉變。\n\n金管局在2020年的人手編制為1,005人。年內，金管局致力透過靈活調配現有資源、提升效率及精簡工作程序，以配合新項目的需要及日益繁重的工作。金管局在2021年的人手編制將維持1,005人，並會重新調配現有資源，應付下述新開展及有所擴展的工作：\n\n# 銀行及金融體系穩定\n- 支援「理財通」的政策發展工作，以及其他粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）與私人財富管理措施，以及持續監管「理財通」業務\n- 處理《保險業條例》及新的場外衍生工具制度下的發牌工作，以及有關虛擬銀行的操守監管工作\n- 實施有關氣候風險的新監管規定，以及加強對銀行的審慎監管\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資、風險管理及其他必要支援，以配合外匯基金持續擴展及多元化的投資工作\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n- 為加強參與金融穩定理事會及其他國際工作小組提供支援\n- 管理新近建議的附帶權益稅務寬減制度，以及核實可合資格獲稅務寬減的基金\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表 1 2021年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以作獎勵及保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms for \"HKMA\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), \"media,\" \"information centres,\" \"financial,\" \"professional capabilities,\" \"innovative culture,\" and \"challenges.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, maintaining the logical flow of the text.\n- Most translations use \"enhance\" or \"enhancing\" for \"增進,\" which is appropriate.\n- The use of \"institutional governance\" for \"機構管治\" is accurate and natural in English.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"society\" or \"community\" for \"社會,\" which is acceptable, but \"public\" is more precise in the context of \"公眾.\"\n- The term \"內\" is translated as \"inwardly\" or \"internally,\" which is correct, but \"internally\" is more natural in formal writing.\n- \"繁重的工作\" is translated as \"increasingly complex tasks\" or \"increasingly complex workload,\" which is acceptable, but \"increasingly complex work\" is more concise and natural.\n- \"推行\" is translated as \"launching\" or \"implementing,\" both of which are correct, but \"rolling out\" might be more precise in some contexts.\n- \"資訊科技保安\" is translated as \"information technology security\" or \"IT security,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"information technology security\" is more precise.\n- Some translations use \"the HKMA\" or \"the Authority\" inconsistently, which can affect readability.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"public\" for \"公眾\" to reflect the intended audience.\n- Use \"internally\" for \"內\" to maintain clarity and formality.\n- Use \"increasingly complex work\" for \"日益繁重的工作\" to be concise and natural.\n- Use \"rolling out\" for \"推行\" to reflect the process of implementing projects.\n- Use \"information technology security\" for \"資訊科技保安\" to be precise.\n- Maintain consistent use of \"the HKMA\" or \"the Authority\" throughout the text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with the public and markets through traditional and social media, websites, information centres, and other channels, enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations. Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, strengthening information technology security, and encouraging an innovative culture, in order to address the challenges brought about by rolling out new projects and increasingly complex work.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some demonstrating a good grasp of the content and structure, while others contain notable errors or awkward phrasing. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"real activities and online activities\" which is awkward. Also, \"2020 year\" is incorrect; it should be \"in 2020.\" The term \"maintains close connection\" is not ideal; \"maintains close contact\" is more natural.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation incorrectly uses \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" for the term \"聯,\" which is not appropriate in this context. The term \"聯\" here refers to \"connection\" or \"link,\" not the monetary system. Also, \"real and online activities\" is awkward, and \"on-site interviews\" is better than \"site visits.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is one of the stronger translations. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently, \"held a total of 93 real and online events\" is natural, and \"on-site interviews\" is appropriate. However, \"real\" might be better as \"in-person\" or \"physical\" for clarity.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"physical and online events\" which is clear, and \"to enhance the public's understanding\" is well phrased. However, repeating \"enhance\" twice is slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is very strong. It uses \"in-person and online activities,\" which is natural, and \"while releasing\" is a good choice for flow. The structure is clear and the language is fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is also strong. It uses \"physical and online events\" and \"issued\" for \"發布,\" which is appropriate. The structure is clear and the language is natural.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and consistency.\n- \"聯\" should be translated as \"contact\" or \"connection,\" not \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- \"實體\" should be translated as \"in-person\" or \"physical\" rather than \"real.\"\n- \"舉辦\" should be translated as \"held\" or \"organised.\"\n- \"發布\" should be translated as \"issued\" or \"released.\"\n- \"每日\" should be translated as \"daily.\"\n- \"增進\" should be translated as \"enhance\" or \"promote.\"\n- \"提高\" should be translated as \"enhance\" or \"increase.\"\n- \"公開\" should be translated as \"public\" or \"publicly.\"\n- \"處\" should be translated as \"functions\" or \"centres,\" depending on context, but in this case, \"functions\" is more appropriate.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and promote the public's understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, the HKMA held a total of 93 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 5 on-site interviews, and 80 other public events. It also arranged 14 media interviews and issued 552 bilingual press releases, while handling a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance society's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main functions, the HKMA organizes media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media and influential individuals, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, green finance, and macroprudential regulatory measures.\n\nMr. Stephen Yuen, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\".  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly identifies \"余偉文\" as \"Mr. Stephen Yuen\" (a common transliteration), uses \"Governor\" for \"總裁\" (which is appropriate for the head of a monetary authority), and accurately translates \"主持線上專題討論\" as \"chaired an online panel discussion.\" The event name \"香港金融科技周2020\" is translated as \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020,\" which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"金融\" as \"fintech\" and \"科技\" as \"tech\" or \"technology.\" The use of \"at\" for \"在\" is appropriate, and the quotation marks are correctly handled.  \n**Translation by the second junior translator:**  \nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Mr. Stephen Lewis chaired an online special discussion at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\".  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation has a few issues. First, \"Stephen Lewis\" is not the correct name for \"余偉文.\" Second, \"Chief Executive\" is not the standard title for the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority; \"Governor\" is more accurate. Third, \"special discussion\" is less precise than \"panel discussion.\"  \n**Translation by the third junior translator:**  \nPayments Management Bureau President Yu Wai-man chaired an online discussion on the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\" topic.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation incorrectly identifies the organization as the \"Payments Management Bureau\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" It also misuses \"on the... topic,\" which is awkward phrasing. Additionally, \"Yu Wai-man\" is not the correct transliteration of \"余偉文.\"  \n**Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s CEO Norman Chan chaired an online in-depth discussion at “Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020”.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation incorrectly uses \"Norman Chan\" instead of \"Stephen Yuen\" and mislabels the position as \"CEO\" instead of \"Governor.\" The phrase \"in-depth discussion\" is unnecessarily verbose and not supported by the original text.  \n**Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \nMr. Yoo Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online discussion on \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\".  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation uses the incorrect name \"Yoo Wai-man\" instead of \"余偉文\" and omits the event name's proper structure. The phrase \"on 'Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020'\" is awkward and lacks the preposition \"at\" that is more natural in this context.  \n**Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \nMr. Yu Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online special discussion at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\".  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThis translation uses the correct title \"Governor\" and the correct organization name. However, it uses the incorrect name \"Yu Wai-man\" and the awkward phrase \"special discussion\" instead of \"panel discussion.\"  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nMr. Stephen Yuen, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired an online panel discussion at \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2020\".  \nThis translation is accurate, fluent, and adheres to the dictionary guidelines. It correctly identifies the person, title, and event, and uses natural English phrasing.\n\nMr. Man Kuet Hang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (center), chaired a media briefing to introduce the HKMA's two-year initiative to promote the application of RegTech (regulatory technology).\n\nMr. Zhou Wenzheng, Director of Fintech at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) enhances public understanding of its work and strengthens communication with the public through social media. It currently operates a total of five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. As of the end of December 2020, over 66,500 users followed the HKMA's social media pages. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA has harnessed social media to continue engaging with the public and effectively dispel false rumors related to the stability of the financial and banking sectors.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe Public Inquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main functions and operations. In 2020, a total of 9,514 enquiries were handled, with about half involving banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure and bond market development, particularly the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, as well as currency and economic data.\n\nChart 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2017, and Chart 2 lists the breakdown of each type of inquiry in 2020.\n\nChart 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\nThe original text, \"圖 1 公眾查詢總數,\" translates to \"Chart 1 Total Number of Public Inquiries\" when rendered in fluent and natural English. This translation effectively captures the meaning of the original text while adhering to the dictionary constraints and maintaining grammatical correctness and cultural appropriateness.\nThe term \"圖\" is correctly translated as \"Chart\" (from the dictionary options: \"Chart,\" \"chart,\" \"Chart 1,\" \"figure\"). \"Chart 1\" is the most natural and commonly used format for labeling figures in English texts.\n\"公眾\" is accurately translated as \"Public\" (dictionary options: \"the public,\" \"public\"). While \"the public\" is grammatically correct, \"Public\" is more concise and commonly used in titles or headings.\n\"查詢\" is best translated as \"Inquiries\" (dictionary options: \"Queries,\" \"Inquiries\"). \"Inquiries\" is more formal and appropriate in the context of public information or data collection, which aligns with the likely context of the chart.\n\"總數\" is correctly translated as \"Total Number of\" (dictionary options: \"aggregate,\" \"total\"). \"Total Number of\" is more precise and natural in this context than \"Total\" alone, as it clearly indicates that the chart represents a count or quantity.\nThe structure \"Chart 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It follows standard conventions for labeling charts and graphs in English, making it both professional and reader-friendly.\nIn comparison, the other translations have various issues:\n- \"Chart 1 Total Public Queries\" is grammatically correct but lacks the clarity of \"Total Number of.\"\n- \"Chart 1 Total Public Inquiries\" is similar but omits \"Number of,\" which slightly reduces clarity.\n- \"Chart 1 total public inquiries\" is not capitalized correctly and lacks the colon, which is standard in such titles.\n- \"Chart 1: Total Public Queries\" is close but uses \"Queries\" instead of \"Inquiries,\" which is less formal and less appropriate for a public context.\n- \"Chart 1 public query total.\" is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.\n- \"Chart 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" is the most accurate and natural translation, as it uses the correct terminology and structure.\nTherefore, \"Chart 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\" is the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nChart 2: Breakdown of Queries Received in 2020 by Nature\nThe original title, \"圖 2 按性質列出2020年接獲的查詢,\" translates to \"Chart 2: Breakdown of Inquiries Received in the Year 2020 by Nature.\" The junior translators have produced several variations of this title, with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\nTranslation 1 is accurate and fluent, using \"Breakdown of Inquiries Received in the Year 2020 by Nature.\" It correctly uses \"Breakdown\" for \"列出\" and \"Inquiries Received\" for \"接獲的查詢.\" The phrase \"by Nature\" is appropriate for \"按性質.\"\nTranslation 2 is also accurate but slightly wordy with \"in the 2020 year\" and uses \"obtained\" for \"接獲,\" which is less precise than \"received.\"\nTranslation 3 is incomplete and awkward, with \"Chart 2 breakdown received in the 2020 year by nature.\" It lacks a verb and is not grammatically complete.\nTranslation 4 is concise and accurate: \"Chart 2: Breakdown by nature of queries received in 2020.\" It uses \"queries\" for \"查詢\" and \"received in 2020\" for \"2020年接獲的.\"\nTranslation 5 is very similar to Translation 1 and is also accurate and fluent.\nTranslation 6 is concise and accurate: \"Chart 2: Breakdown of 2020 Inquiries Received by Nature.\" It uses \"Inquiries Received\" for \"接獲的查詢\" and \"by Nature\" for \"按性質.\"\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and fluent. It should use \"Breakdown\" for \"列出,\" \"Queries Received\" for \"接獲的查詢,\" and \"by Nature\" for \"按性質.\" It should also use \"Chart 2\" for \"圖 2\" and \"2020\" for \"2020年.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation is: \"Chart 2: Breakdown of Queries Received in 2020 by Nature.\" This translation is concise, accurate, and fluent, and it uses the correct terms from the dictionary.\n\n# publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the Authority published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Currency and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report during the year, and regularly updated the data in the Monthly Financial Data Report, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong's currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the Authority published a total of 18 \"Insights\" articles, introducing its key measures and policies, and discussing issues of public concern.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal announcement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) 2019 Annual Report receiving a silver award in a specific category of an annual report competition. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Evaluation\" instead of \"Selection\" or \"Competition,\" which may not be the exact term used in the original. Also, \"Hong Kong Institute of Management\" is not the exact name of the organization mentioned in the original, which is \"香港管理專業協會\" (Hong Kong Management Professional Association).\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is more accurate in terms of the organization's name, using \"Hong Kong Professional Management Association.\" However, \"Competition\" may not be the exact term used in the original, which is \"評選\" (selection).\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the original, using \"Selection\" and correctly identifying the organization as \"Hong Kong Management Association.\" However, it omits the word \"Professional\" from the organization's name, which is present in the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"obtained\" for \"獲\" and \"selection\" for \"評選.\" It also correctly identifies the organization as \"Hong Kong Management Association.\" However, it uses \"annual report selection\" instead of \"annual best annual report selection,\" which is slightly redundant.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"Excellence Awards\" for \"最佳年報評選,\" which is a more formal and appropriate term. It also correctly identifies the organization as \"Hong Kong Institute of Management,\" though this may not be the exact name of the organization in the original.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate in terms of the dictionary terms used, but it uses \"management professional association\" instead of \"Management Professional Association\" and \"2020 year best annual report selection\" instead of \"2020 annual best annual report selection,\" which is slightly less formal.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact organization name: \"香港管理專業協會\" → \"Hong Kong Management Professional Association\"\n- Use the correct term for \"評選\" → \"selection\"\n- Use the correct term for \"獲\" → \"obtained\" or \"won\"\n- Use the correct term for \"銀獎\" → \"silver award\"\n- Ensure the sentence is fluent and natural in English\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be:\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2019 annual report obtained the silver award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Institutions\" category at the Hong Kong Management Professional Association’s 2020 annual best annual report selection.\n\n# Payments Bureau website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 40,000 pages of information in English and both simplified and traditional Chinese characters, facilitating the public's access to the latest information from the Authority. The website also contains the \"Register of Licensed Institutions and Their Local Representatives' Offices\" and the \"Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Licensed Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Instruments,\" maintained in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments Ordinance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has, since 2018, released financial data and key information contained on its website through open application programming interfaces (open APIs) in phases. By the end of 2020, the Authority had launched a total of 144 sets of open APIs on its website as scheduled.\n\nThe Monetary Authority actively supports the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Payments Information Centre\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the location of the Information Centre as the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2.\n- Most translations accurately convey the purpose of the Information Centre: to inform the public about the HKMA and enhance understanding of currency and banking matters.\n- The structure of the Information Centre (exhibition hall and library) is consistently described across translations.\n- The mention of the library's collection of over 26,000 books, journals, and publications is well-represented.\n- The requirement for the library to maintain the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representatives’ Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Authorized Institutions\" is accurately reflected in most translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Consistency:** Some translations use inconsistent terms for \"Information Centre\" (e.g., \"Information Centre\" vs. \"Exhibition Hall\" vs. \"Library\" with capitalization). The dictionary specifies \"centre\" or \"hub\" as acceptable translations for \"中心,\" so consistency in capitalization and terminology is important.\n- **Fluency and Grammar:** Some translations are slightly awkward in phrasing, such as \"introducing the public to the Monetary Authority's work\" (should be \"introducing the public to the work of the Monetary Authority\").\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"central banking\" is used in some translations, which is appropriate, but \"central bank\" might be more precise in the context of the Banking Ordinance.\n- **Dictionary Compliance:** Some translations use terms not listed in the dictionary. For example, \"financial centre\" is used in one translation, but the dictionary does not list this as an alternative for \"金融中心.\" The correct term is \"financial centre\" or \"financial center,\" which is acceptable.\n- **Punctuation and Quotation Marks:** Some translations use inconsistent quotation marks or fail to use them at all for the register titles.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use consistent terminology as per the dictionary.\n- Maintain natural English fluency and grammar.\n- Ensure accurate and culturally appropriate terminology.\n- Correctly use quotation marks for register titles.\n- Avoid unnecessary capitalization unless it is part of a proper noun.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate translations while ensuring consistency and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Phase 2 of the International Financial Centre. It introduces the HKMA's work and enhances the public's understanding of currency and banking matters. The Information Centre is divided into two parts: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sectors in an interactive way, and also provides data and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses more than 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics related to Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representatives’ Offices\" and the \"Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions,\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe original text highlights the achievement of the \"資訊中心\" (Information Centre) of the \"金管局\" (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) in winning a Platinum Award in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS.\" The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"Payments Institute\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"carefully design\" is grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"engages among thousands of people\" is awkward and misrepresents the original meaning.\n2. **Second Translation:** Correctly uses \"Payments Institute information centre\" but \"Payments Institute\" is still not the correct name for \"金管局.\" The phrase \"stood out from over a thousand participants globally\" is accurate, and the structure is fluent.\n3. **Third Translation:** Incorrectly uses \"Goldcorp\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" The phrase \"meticulously designed and unique atmosphere\" is well phrased, but the name error undermines the translation.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Correctly identifies \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre\" and uses \"meticulously designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere.\" The structure is fluent and accurate, though \"winning one of the Platinum Awards\" could be more precise as \"becoming one of the Platinum Award winners.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"Payments Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is incorrect. The rest of the translation is fluent and accurate.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Correctly identifies \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre\" and uses \"by virtue of its carefully designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere.\" The structure is fluent and accurate, with only minor adjustments needed for precision.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Correctly identify \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Use \"資訊中心\" as \"Information Centre.\"\n- Use \"2020\" as \"2020\" without adding \"year.\"\n- Use \"設計及\" as \"design and.\"\n- Use \"參\" as \"participants.\"\n- Use \"全球\" as \"globally\" or \"from around the world.\"\n- Ensure the phrase \"became one of the Platinum Award winners\" is used for \"成為...得獎者之一.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre, by virtue of its carefully designed and uniquely distinctive atmosphere, stood out among thousands of participants from around the world and became one of the Platinum Award winners in the Interior Design category at the 2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS.\n\nThe Information Centre made use of the opportunity presented by the suspension of operations in 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic to optimize the facilities of the \"Policy\" section. The section outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work and introduces related financial concepts. The optimization measures were implemented in response to visitor feedback, making the interactive facilities more user-friendly, more engaging, and more durable, thereby making the visit more enjoyable.\n\nThe interactive facilities in the \"Policy\" section of the Information Centre have completed the optimization project.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**資訊中心的展覽館部分介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Payments Authority\" for \"金管局\", which is a direct translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Payments Authority\" is not the official name of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The correct term is \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\". Also, \"exhibition hall\" is acceptable, but \"part\" is awkward here.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: \"資訊\" is translated as \"information\", which is correct. \"發展\" is translated as \"development\", which is acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Information Centre\" is capitalized inconsistently. \"Banking industry\" is slightly off; \"banking sector\" is more standard in this context.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: \"發展\" is translated as \"development\", which is correct.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"banking industry\".  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"exhibition hall part\" is awkward phrasing.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: All terms are translated appropriately.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"banking industry\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"exhibition hall\" is fine, but \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work\" is slightly more natural than \"the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\".  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: All terms are translated correctly.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"exhibition area\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work\", which are natural and fluent.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Information Centre\" is capitalized inconsistently.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: All terms are translated correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and \"banking industry\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"exhibition section\" is slightly less natural than \"exhibition area\" or \"exhibition hall\".  \n   - **Dictionary compliance**: All terms are translated correctly.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct official name: **Hong Kong Monetary Authority** (not \"Payments Authority\").\n- Use natural phrasing: \"exhibition area\" or \"exhibition hall\" is better than \"exhibition section\" or \"exhibition hall part\".\n- Use \"banking sector\" instead of \"banking industry\" for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Ensure proper capitalization of \"Information Centre\" if it is a proper noun.\n### Final Translation:\nThe exhibition area of the Information Centre introduces the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector.\n\nTo ensure the public, regardless of race, can equally access the facilities of the information centre, the centre has formulated procedures to provide interpretation services for visitors in need and individuals who call the centre's hotline for inquiries.\n\nThe opening hours and services of the Information Centre have been affected by the ongoing pandemic. To safeguard public safety and maintain a high standard of hygiene environment, the Information Centre has implemented special opening arrangements and anti-epidemic measures throughout the year, and stepped up cleaning and disinfection. Facilities and exhibits are regularly disinfected with long-lasting antimicrobial coatings.\n\n# Public and Consumer Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA held an online public education webinar in 2020, attracting over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools. The webinar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's operations, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, and the deposit protection scheme. Since its launch in 1998, this is the first time the educational webinar has been held in an online format, with over 61,000 students and teachers having participated to date.\n\nMore than 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools attended the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's online public education webinar.\nThe first junior translator's translation is accurate and fluent, correctly using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) for \"金管局\" and \"webinar\" for \"講座.\" However, the term \"public education\" is slightly ambiguous and could be more precise. The use of \"teachers and students\" is appropriate, though the order could be reversed for better flow.\nMore than 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools participated in the HKMA's online public education lecture.\nThe second junior translator's translation is very similar to the first, with the only difference being the use of \"participated in\" instead of \"attended\" and \"lecture\" instead of \"webinar.\" Both are acceptable, but \"webinar\" is more specific to an online lecture.\nMore than 1,600 people from 61 schools attended the Payments webinar hosted online by the public education section.\nThe third junior translator's translation is problematic. \"Payments\" is incorrectly used for \"金管局\" (HKMA), and \"public education section\" is not an accurate translation of the context. The term \"public education\" should be associated with the HKMA, not a separate section.\nMore than 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools participated in the HKMA's online public education lecture.\nThe fourth junior translator's translation is nearly identical to the second, with the same minor differences in verb choice and term selection.\nMore than 1,600 people from over 61 secondary schools participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s online public education webinars.\nThe fifth junior translator's translation uses \"over 61\" instead of \"61,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"webinars\" is plural, but the original text refers to a singular event. The use of \"people\" is less precise than \"teachers and students.\"\nMore than 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's online public education webinar.\nThe sixth junior translator's translation is accurate and fluent, using \"webinar\" appropriately and correctly identifying the HKMA. However, the order of \"students and teachers\" could be reversed for better flow.\nBased on the above review, the best possible translation would use \"teachers and students\" for clarity, \"webinar\" for \"講座,\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for \"金管局.\" The use of \"attended\" is slightly more natural than \"participated in\" in this context. The term \"public education\" should be associated with the HKMA, not a separate section.\nMore than 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools attended the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's online public education webinar.\n\nThe HKMA educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers and maintains communication with the public on this matter. One of the key focuses of the related educational efforts continues to be \"Protection of personal digital keys.\" During the year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos, urging citizens to properly safeguard their financial accounts and personal information at all times and places. Given the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA reminds citizens to be vigilant when shopping online or using personal authentication information, and to be cautious of fraud schemes.\n\nTo improve the translation of the original Traditional Chinese text, a critical review of the junior translators' work is necessary. The primary goal is to ensure that the translation is fluent, grammatically correct, and accurately reflects the original meaning while adhering to the dictionary's specified term translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key term \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"Monetary Authority.\"\n- The term \"網劇\" is consistently translated as \"online drama series.\"\n- The term \"推出\" is accurately translated as \"launched\" or \"released.\"\n- The term \"社交媒體\" is correctly rendered as \"social media.\"\n- The term \"國際合作\" is consistently translated as \"international cooperation.\"\n- The term \"貨幣\" is translated as \"currency\" or \"Currency,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"普及金融\" is translated as \"inclusive finance\" or \"financial inclusion,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"監管\" is translated as \"regulation\" or \"regulatory,\" which is acceptable.\n- The term \"金融科技\" is translated as \"fintech,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"聯繫匯率制度\" is translated as \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" or \"linked exchange rate system,\" which is accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"the public education online drama series\" instead of \"public education online drama series,\" which is unnecessary and slightly awkward.\n- The term \"人\" is translated as \"individuals,\" \"persons,\" or \"people,\" but \"young people\" is more natural and concise.\n- The term \"提高\" is translated as \"increase,\" \"raise,\" or \"boost,\" which are all acceptable, but \"increase\" is more commonly used in formal contexts.\n- The term \"興趣\" is translated as \"interest,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"一系列\" is translated as \"a series of,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"範疇\" is translated as \"areas\" or \"aspects,\" which is appropriate.\n- The term \"2020\" is translated as \"2020 year\" in one translation, which is redundant and should be \"2020.\"\n- The term \"發布\" is translated as \"posted\" or \"released,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"合作\" is translated as \"cooperation,\" which is accurate.\n- The term \"科技\" is translated as \"technology\" or \"technological,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"貼\" is translated as \"transfer\" or \"lending,\" which is incorrect. The correct translation should be \"posts\" or \"posts.\"\n- The term \"繫\" is translated as \"Linked,\" which is correct in the context of \"聯繫匯率制度\" as \"Linked Exchange Rate System.\"\n- The term \"入\" is translated as \"inflow,\" which is incorrect in this context. It should be omitted or rephrased.\n- The term \"相關\" is translated as \"related,\" which is correct.\n- The term \"聯\" is translated as \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" or \"LERS,\" which is accurate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"young people\" instead of \"young individuals\" or \"young persons\" for naturalness.\n- Use \"increase\" instead of \"raise\" or \"boost\" for consistency with formal tone.\n- Use \"2020\" instead of \"2020 year\" for conciseness.\n- Use \"posts\" instead of \"transfer posts\" for accuracy.\n- Omit \"inflow\" as it is not relevant in this context.\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly and consistently.\n**Best Translation:**\nTo increase young people's interest in working for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the HKMA launched the public education online drama series \"STEPS\" in 2020 and posted a series of related posts on social media, introducing the HKMA's work in areas such as currency, the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, financial inclusion, banking regulation, and international cooperation.\n\nThe public education online drama series \"STEPS\" uses a light-hearted approach, through the story of a newly hired young person's growth, to introduce the main functions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局在數碼平台及戶外媒體廣泛宣傳保護個人數碼鎖匙的訊息。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority widely promotes information on the Protection of personal digital keys on digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Protection of personal digital keys\" from the dictionary, and \"outdoor media\" is a suitable translation for \"戶外媒體.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Protection of personal digital keys\" is capitalized unnecessarily. \"HKMA\" is not used, which is a common abbreviation for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority widely promotes information on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and overseas media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, and \"overseas media\" is a possible translation for \"戶外媒體.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Overseas media\" may not be the best fit for \"戶外媒體,\" which more accurately refers to \"outdoor\" or \"external\" media, not necessarily international.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"Payments regulator widely promoted information on Protection of personal digital keys on digital platforms and outside media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"outside media\" for \"戶外媒體.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Incorrectly uses \"Payments regulator\" instead of \"HKMA,\" and \"Protection of personal digital keys\" is capitalized. Also, the verb tense is past (\"promoted\") instead of present (\"promotes\").\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has widely promoted information on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and overseas media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"protection of personal digital keys\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Overseas media\" is not the best fit for \"戶外媒體,\" and the use of \"has promoted\" implies a completed action, which may not align with the original sentence's present tense.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA widely promotes information on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and overseas media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"protection of personal digital keys\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Overseas media\" is not the best fit for \"戶外媒體.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA widely promotes information on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"outdoor media\" for \"戶外媒體,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Protection of personal digital keys\" is not capitalized, which is correct, but the sentence is otherwise fluent and accurate.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the standard abbreviation.\n- Use \"digital platforms\" for \"數碼平台.\"\n- Use \"outdoor media\" for \"戶外媒體,\" which is more accurate than \"overseas media.\"\n- Use \"protection of personal digital keys\" from the dictionary, with correct capitalization.\n- Maintain present tense to reflect the ongoing nature of the promotion.\n### Final Translation:\nThe HKMA widely promotes information on the protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for improvement:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: The dictionary specifies that \"網上親\" should be translated as \"online parenting.\" While most translations use \"online parenting,\" some use \"online parent-child,\" which is less precise. \"Online parenting\" is the exact match and should be used consistently.\n2. **Term Selection from Dictionary**: The term \"教育\" should be translated as \"education\" or \"educational.\" Most translations use \"education\" correctly. However, \"financial education\" is more natural than \"financial education activity\" or \"financial education initiative.\"\n3. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some use awkward phrasing, such as \"the program teaches kindergarten and primary school students the basic concepts of money and financial management.\" A smoother version would be \"teaching kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts of money and financial management.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"填色比賽\" is translated as \"colouring competitions\" or \"colouring contests.\" Both are acceptable, but \"colouring competitions\" is more aligned with the context of an educational activity.\n5. **Use of \"HKMA\"**: The first translation uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" fully, while others use \"HKMA.\" It is acceptable to use the acronym once it has been introduced, but consistency is key.\n6. **\"銀行\" and \"支付\"**: The dictionary lists multiple options for \"銀行\" and \"支付.\" The most natural and consistent translations are \"banks\" and \"payment services,\" respectively.\n7. **\"合作\"**: The dictionary provides several options for \"合作,\" including \"collaborated,\" \"cooperation,\" and \"collaboration.\" The most natural choice in context is \"collaborated\" or \"collaborated with.\"\n8. **\"活動\"**: The dictionary lists several options for \"活動,\" including \"activities,\" \"events,\" and \"initiatives.\" \"Activities\" is the most neutral and appropriate choice here.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also collaborated with various stakeholders through multiple community participation activities, one of which is the online parenting financial education activity \"Little Financial Experts.\" Through animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and colouring competitions, it teaches kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts of money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge about banks and payment services.\n\nThe original sentence is: \"以Dollar豬和金氏一家為主角的動畫影片，就五個主題發放訊息。\" The dictionary provides specific translations for certain terms, and the goal is to ensure these are used accurately while maintaining fluency and natural English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The animated film featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family as the main characters disseminates information on five themes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"disseminates information\" and includes \"as the main characters,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Disseminates\" is slightly formal and may not be the most natural choice for \"發放.\" Also, \"themes\" is acceptable, but \"topics\" might be more natural in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"An animated film featuring the mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family disseminates information on five themes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"disseminates information\" and is concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits \"as the main characters,\" which is important for clarity. Also, \"themes\" is slightly less natural than \"topics.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The animated video featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family issues information on five topics.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"issues information\" and \"topics,\" which are both natural.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Animated video\" is less common than \"animated film.\" Also, \"issues information\" is less idiomatic than \"disseminates\" or \"conveys.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The animated film featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family conveys messages on five themes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"conveys messages,\" which is natural and idiomatic.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Messages\" is not the exact match for \"訊息\" (information), and \"themes\" is slightly less natural than \"topics.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"An animated film featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family as the main characters disseminates information on five themes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Very similar to the first translation, with accurate use of \"disseminates information\" and \"as the main characters.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the first translation—slightly formal and \"themes\" is less natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"An animated film with the mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family as the top issue information on five themes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** None.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing. \"Top issue information\" is not a coherent phrase and misuses the dictionary term \"題\" (top).\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"disseminates information\" or \"conveys messages\" for \"發放訊息.\"\n- Use \"as the main characters\" to accurately reflect \"以...為主角.\"\n- Use \"topics\" instead of \"themes\" for better naturalness.\n- Use \"animated film\" instead of \"animated video.\"\n- Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe animated film featuring mascot Dollar Pig and the Kam family as the main characters disseminates information on five topics.\n\nDemonstrate how to make DIY toys using eco-friendly materials.\n\nOther work related to youth education includes online financial literacy Q&A competitions, online educational webinars for secondary school students and teachers, collaboration with a professional association to produce a comic book targeting primary school students and their parents, and organizing online webinars for university students.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Investors and Financial Education Committee in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong citizens, and will study further cooperation with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community participation.\n\n# Payments Authority Staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the Government structure, but it employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent work team to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to ever-changing work requirements.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in quality, with some demonstrating a strong grasp of the content and structure, while others contain grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or incorrect use of dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** uses \"less extensive work procedures\" for \"精簡\", which is not the best fit. \"精簡\" should be translated as \"streamline\" or \"streamlining\", not \"less extensive\". Also, \"payable the following newly launched\" is grammatically incorrect.\n**Translation 2** is the most accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"streamlining\" for \"精簡\", \"flexible redeployment\" for \"靈活調配\", and \"address the needs of the following new initiatives and expanded workstreams\" for the final sentence. However, \"manpower establishment\" could be more natural as \"staffing\" or \"staff strength\".\n**Translation 3** is also strong, with correct use of \"streamlining\" and \"redeploying\". It uses \"staff strength\" and \"address the following newly initiated and expanded work\", which is natural and accurate.\n**Translation 4** uses \"making procedures less extensive\" for \"精簡\", which is incorrect. It should be \"streamlining work procedures\". Otherwise, the translation is fluent and accurate.\n**Translation 5** uses \"less extensive work procedures\" again, which is incorrect. It also uses \"is committed to\" in the present tense for a past year, which is inconsistent with the original text.\n**Translation 6** uses \"payable the new initiatives\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"manpower allocation\" which is less natural than \"staffing\" or \"staff strength\".\n**Reasoning for the best translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"streamlining\" for \"精簡\", \"flexible redeployment\" for \"靈活調配\", and \"address the needs of the following new initiatives and expanded workstreams\" for the final sentence. It should also use \"staffing\" or \"staff strength\" for \"人手編制\", and maintain consistent tense and structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority had a staffing of 1,005 individuals in 2020. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was committed to flexibly redeploying existing resources, enhancing efficiency, and streamlining work procedures to meet the needs of new projects and increasingly complex work. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s staffing will remain at 1,005 individuals in 2021, and it will redeploy existing resources to address the needs of the following newly launched and expanded work:\n\n# Banking and Financial System Stability  \n- Support the policy development work for \"Wealth Connect,\" as well as other measures related to private wealth management in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Hong Kong-Macao region, and continue to supervise the business of \"Wealth Connect\"  \n- Handle licensing work under the Insurance Ordinance and the new regime for over-the-counter derivatives, as well as conduct supervision for virtual banks  \n- Implement new regulatory requirements on climate-related risks, and strengthen prudential supervision over banks\n\n# Reserve Management  \n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to support the Exchange Fund's sustained expansion and diversification of its investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre  \n- To provide support for strengthening participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups  \n- To manage the recently recommended equity tax concession regime, and to verify the eligibility of funds for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists by department the position system and actual number of staff members of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nTable 1: Staffing Structure and Actual Number of Staff Members of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2021\n\n# Remuneration and Benefits Policy and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency in translating the original Traditional Chinese text. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"remuneration\" and \"service conditions.\" However, \"solicits the views of the governance committee under his jurisdiction\" is slightly awkward, and \"once a year\" could be more naturally phrased as \"annually.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the original in meaning and structure. The use of \"portfolio\" for \"組合\" is appropriate, and \"mandatory provident fund contributions\" is a precise translation. However, \"with reference to\" is slightly more formal than necessary, and \"variable pay issued once a year\" could be smoother as \"variable pay disbursed annually.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less accurate in some areas. \"Occupational Payments\" is not a standard term and likely a mistranslation of \"公積金\" (provident fund). Also, \"listened to the opinion\" is not an accurate reflection of \"透過...聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見\" (through... seeking the views of the governance committee under its jurisdiction).\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. The use of \"taking into account\" is appropriate, and \"variable component\" is a good choice for \"浮動薪酬.\" However, \"which is paid once a year\" could be more concise as \"paid annually.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very strong, with accurate terminology and natural phrasing. The use of \"Consultative Committee\" for \"諮詢委員會\" is appropriate, and \"disbursed annually\" is a natural expression. However, \"mandatory provident fund\" may be more accurately translated as \"provident fund contributions\" to reflect the context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms like \"FS\" and \"provident fund.\" However, \"seeks the views of the governing committee under its governance\" is slightly redundant and could be simplified to \"seeks the views of the governing committee under its jurisdiction.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should avoid redundancy, use natural phrasing, and ensure that all terms from the dictionary are translated correctly. Based on the above review, the fifth and fourth translations are the strongest, with the fifth being slightly more natural in phrasing and the fourth being more concise.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary determines the remuneration and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, taking into account the opinions of its governing committees under its jurisdiction, as well as market remuneration levels and practices. The remuneration package includes cash remuneration and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash remuneration comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and variable pay disbursed annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the remuneration of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for recommendations from its Governance Committee, and considers the Governance Committee's assessment of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey in the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual staff members with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments to reward them and maintain their remuneration competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates the approved funds for adjusting annual fixed and variable remuneration based on individual employees' work performance; the variable remuneration system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. The adjustment of fixed remuneration and disbursement of variable remuneration for employees at or above the Assistant Chief Executive level are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee; such employees will absent themselves from meetings when their remuneration proposals are discussed. For employees at or below the Director level, the adjustment of fixed remuneration and disbursement of variable remuneration are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive, based on the lump sum approved for payment of remuneration, pursuant to the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

Authority is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, with the goal of becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The Authority fulfills this commitment in various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally friendly markets, caring for the broader society, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly work environment.\n\nTo address the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced various measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping Hong Kong's economy weather the crisis.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are some nuances to consider. The term \"綠色\" is translated as \"Green\" or \"green,\" and \"可持續\" is translated as \"sustainable\" or \"sustainability.\" The term \"金融\" is translated as \"finance,\" \"Financial,\" or \"fintech.\" \nThe first, second, third, and sixth translations use \"Green and Sustainable Finance,\" which is a common and appropriate title for this topic. The fourth translation uses lowercase \"green and sustainable finance,\" which is also correct but less formal. The fifth translation, \"Green and sustainability finance,\" is less common and may be confusing to readers.\nConsidering the context and the need for a professional and formal title, \"Green and Sustainable Finance\" is the most appropriate translation. It is consistent with industry terminology and maintains the proper capitalization for a title. \nTherefore, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is \"Green and Sustainable Finance.\"\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the sustainability of the global economy. As an important part of society, the financial system is inevitably affected; and as a component of the financial system, banks should be more proactive in managing climate risks. In light of this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been committed to exploring methods to address this challenge and is currently implementing various measures announced in May 2019, promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include promoting the development of green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common framework with industry stakeholders to assess the current \"green benchmarks\" of banks, as well as to collaborate with international organizations to provide technical support to local banks.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Phase Three\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\nThe original sentence is concise and formal, with a clear structure: it calls for the focused execution, review, and evaluation of banks' progress in a specific area. The key terms—審視, 評估, 落實, and 銀行—must be translated precisely according to the dictionary provided.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Concentrate on implementing, reviewing, and assessing the progress of banks in this aspect.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"reviewing\" and \"assessing\" correctly, and \"this aspect\" aligns with \"這方面.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Concentrate on implementing\" is slightly awkward; \"implementing\" is not the best fit for \"落實\" in this context. Also, \"this aspect\" is slightly less natural than \"this area.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Focus on implementation, review, and assessment of the bank(s) in this aspect.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"review\" and \"assessment\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Implementation\" is a noun, but \"落實\" is more verb-like. Also, \"the bank(s)\" is too specific; the original refers to the banking sector in general.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Focus on implementation, review, and assess the progress of banks in these aspects.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"review\" and \"assess\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Implementation\" is a noun, and \"these aspects\" is incorrect; the original says \"這方面,\" which is singular.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Concentrate on the implementation, review, and evaluate the progress of banks in this aspect.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"review\" and \"evaluate\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Implementation\" is a noun, and \"evaluate\" is not the best fit for \"評估\" in this context. Also, the structure is awkward with \"review\" and \"evaluate\" as separate verbs.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Focus on the implementation, review, and assessment of the bank's progress in this aspect.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"review\" and \"assessment\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"The bank's\" is too specific; the original refers to banks in general. Also, \"implementation\" is a noun, not a verb.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Focus on the implementation, review, and assessment of banks' progress in this area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"review\" and \"assessment\" correctly. \"This area\" is a natural alternative to \"this aspect.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Implementation\" is a noun, not a verb, and the structure is slightly awkward.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFocus on implementing, reviewing, and assessing the progress of banks in this area.\n\nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) participates in a number of international organizations, including the Central Banks and Supervisory Institutions Green Finance Network, the Senior-Level Working Group on Climate-Related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Working Group under the Banking Supervision Working Group of the East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Meetings, and the International Sustainable Finance Platform. Through participation in these international organizations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the efforts of central banks and regulatory authorities in addressing climate change, and can draw on the experiences and perspectives of other regions when formulating local frameworks.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use appropriate dictionary alternatives, such as \"green\" for \"綠色,\" \"regulatory\" for \"監管,\" and \"climate-related\" for \"氣候.\"\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, which is appropriate.\n- The structure of the sentences is largely clear and follows the original text's logic.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"workstream\" instead of \"working group,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary's \"work\" or \"working\" options. \"Working group\" is more standard in this context.\n- **Fluency and Naturalness:** Some translations are overly literal, such as \"which are currently not available\" or \"but which are currently not available,\" which can be more naturally phrased as \"that are currently not available.\"\n- **Use of \"Data Projects\" vs. \"Data Items\":** A few translations use \"data projects\" instead of \"data items,\" which is not aligned with the dictionary's \"項目\" → \"project\" but \"data items\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Chapter Title Capitalization:** Some translations capitalize \"Banking Sector Stability\" inconsistently, while others use lowercase or mixed case, which should be standardized as \"Banking Sector Stability\" or \"Banking System Stability\" as per the original.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"working group\" consistently as per the dictionary's \"工作組\" → \"working group.\"\n- Use \"data items\" instead of \"data projects\" for \"項目.\"\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of the chapter title.\n- Use more natural phrasing, such as \"that are currently not available\" instead of \"which are currently not available\" or \"but which are currently not available.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority also participates in multiple working groups under the Green Finance Network of central banks and regulatory authorities, including the microprudential supervision working group, the macro-financial working group, and the working group promoting green finance. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has joined two newly established working groups: the Research Working Group and the Working Group on Addressing Data Gaps. The Research Working Group is responsible for related research work, while the Working Group on Addressing Data Gaps aims to develop a detailed list of data items that regulatory authorities and financial institutions need to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, which are currently not available. Details of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in promoting green and sustainable banking development during the year can be found in the chapter titled \"Banking Sector Stability.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, with proper use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance\" and \"credible green banks.\" The structure is clear, and the translation of \"23 trillion\" is accurate. However, it uses \"reaching\" instead of \"estimated to reach\" for the investment figure, which is slightly less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Green Commercial Bank Alliance\" and \"credible green banks.\" However, it incorrectly translates \"23 trillion\" as \"230 billion,\" which is a significant error. It also omits the \"estimated\" part, which is important for clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but has some issues. It uses \"Green Banking Alliance\" instead of \"Green Commercial Banking Alliance,\" which is a minor deviation. It also uses \"Green Finance road map\" with capitalization that may not be necessary. The term \"executive council member\" is not in the dictionary, and \"executive director\" is the correct term.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent but has some grammatical issues. It uses \"actively engages in promoting\" instead of \"promotes,\" which is acceptable but less direct. It also uses \"drive the global green agenda\" instead of \"advance\" or \"promote,\" which is slightly less formal. The term \"capitalise on\" is correct, but \"seize\" is also acceptable.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" and \"credible green banks.\" However, it uses \"business banking\" instead of \"commercial banking,\" which is a minor deviation. It also uses \"seize\" instead of \"capture\" or \"capitalise on,\" which is acceptable but less formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"Green Business Banking Alliance\" and \"credible green banks.\" It also uses \"transition into\" instead of \"transform into,\" which is slightly different but still correct. It correctly uses \"capitalizes on\" and \"estimated to reach.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and use the correct terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text and ensure that all numerical values are correctly translated. Based on the above review, the first and sixth translations are the most accurate, but the first one has a minor issue with the \"23 trillion\" figure. The sixth translation is more precise in its use of terms and structure.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Green Commercial Banking Alliance with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in November, assisting banks in emerging markets in formulating strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive director of the alliance, the HKMA i) promotes the development of green commercial banking in global financial markets; ii) provides a platform for commercial banks to learn from each other, acquiring the necessary knowledge, tools, and commercial information to develop their own green finance roadmaps and transform into credible green banks; iii) facilitates communication and explores cutting-edge topics to advance the global green agenda; and iv) assists alliance members in cooperation, and captures the estimated $23 trillion in emerging market green and climate-related investment opportunities identified by the IFC over the next 10 years.\n\nLocally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with other financial regulatory institutions to coordinate measures in the financial sector to address climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing the related work of the government's Green Bond Programme, the HKMA also jointly established the Cross-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance (Steering Group) with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to handle cross-sector regulatory and market development matters. Details of the HKMA's work this year in developing Hong Kong as a green and sustainable finance hub are set out in the chapter \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre.\"\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group\nThe junior translators have mostly captured the correct terminology, but there are a few issues to address. The term \"金融\" is translated as \"Finance\" in some versions and \"financial\" in others. Based on the dictionary, \"finance\" is the most appropriate choice here. \"可持續\" is correctly translated as \"sustainable\" in most versions, though one version uses \"sustainability,\" which is less appropriate in this context. \"跨機\" is consistently translated as \"cross-agency,\" which is correct. \"構督導\" is translated as \"Steering Group\" in all versions, which is accurate. \"綠色\" is translated as \"Green\" or \"green,\" both of which are acceptable, but \"Green\" with a capital \"G\" may be more appropriate for a formal title. \"小組\" is translated as \"Group\" or \"Steering Group,\" but \"Steering Group\" is already used for \"構督導,\" so \"Group\" is more appropriate here.\nConsidering these points, the best translation would be \"Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group.\" This version uses the correct terms from the dictionary, maintains proper capitalization, and provides a clear and professional title.\n\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate measures to address climate and environmental risks in the financial sector, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government's climate strategy. The Steering Group was jointly established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission in May, with other members including the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the Steering Group has established two dedicated technical working groups, respectively responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory issues, as well as coordinating cross-institutional market development work.\n\nThe Steering Group released the Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, proposing six aspects to strengthen Hong Kong's financial ecosystem and build a more green and sustainable future in the long term. The Steering Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organised the establishment meeting of the Steering Group, with Mr. Yu Weiwen, the HKMA Chief Executive (third from the right), serving as the co-chair of the group.\n\nThe Steering Group released Hong Kong’s Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy Plan and five major action initiatives.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment, incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a large-scale asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly concerned with responsible investment, which will impact how its fund managers conduct investment activities.\n\n# Payments Authority's Beliefs\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) belief that emphasizing responsible investment and considering the long-term sustainable performance of various investments will help achieve the Exchange Fund's investment objectives and reduce ESG-related risks in investment activities.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"more effectively achieve\" and \"reduce ESG-related risks involved in investment activities.\" However, \"the Exchange Fund\" should be capitalized as \"Exchange Fund\" per the dictionary.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"further effectively reach\" which is slightly awkward. Also, \"Responsible Investment\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Contains a grammatical error: \"considering the long-term performance of various investment and sustainability\" is unclear and incorrect. Also, \"reduce risks involving ESG-related activities\" misrepresents the original meaning.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"more effectively achieve\" and \"reduce the ESG-related risks involved in investment activities.\" It also correctly capitalizes \"Exchange Fund.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Similar to the fourth, but uses \"be more effective in reaching\" which is slightly less direct than \"more effectively achieve.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"emphasizing responsible investment\" without \"appropriately,\" which omits a nuance from the original. Also, \"also reduce\" is slightly less direct than \"and reduce.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Capitalize \"Exchange Fund\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"more effectively achieve\" for clarity and directness.\n- Ensure \"Responsible Investment\" is capitalized appropriately.\n- Maintain the structure and nuance of the original sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing Responsible Investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund's investment objectives and reduce the ESG-related risks involved in investment activities.\n\n# The Principles of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), ESG investments are generally given priority when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment projects. As responsible long-term investors, the HKMA will adopt the following principles of responsible investment in the investment management process in response to the circumstances.\n\n# Incorporate\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects, and therefore incorporates ESG factors into the investment analysis process to identify risks and opportunities. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority incorporates ESG factors into the investment management processes of both public and private markets.\n\n# Active exercise of asset ownership.\nThe original phrase \"主動行使資產擁有權\" translates to \"Active exercise of asset ownership\" in English. The junior translators have mostly captured the meaning accurately, though there are minor differences in punctuation and phrasing. The first and sixth translations use \"Actively exercise asset ownership,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less formal than the other versions. The second translation includes a hashtag, which may be appropriate in certain contexts but is not necessary here. The third, fourth, and fifth translations are identical and omit the verb \"exercise,\" which is a key component of the original phrase.\nThe best translation should maintain the formal tone of the original while ensuring clarity and grammatical correctness. \"Active exercise of asset ownership\" is the most accurate and natural translation, as it preserves the structure and meaning of the original phrase without unnecessary punctuation or alterations.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This version is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" consistently and correctly translating \"public equity holdings\" from the dictionary. It uses \"long-term shareholder interests\" and \"fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over investment projects,\" which are natural and precise. However, \"through exercising voting rights and communicating with the invested companies\" could be slightly more concise.\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is also fluent but uses \"responsible business practices\" instead of \"responsible corporate behavior,\" which is not the exact term from the dictionary. It also uses \"when communicating with invested companies,\" which is grammatically awkward and less natural than \"by communicating with.\"\n3. **Third Translation**: This version uses \"Responsible Investment\" as per the dictionary, which is appropriate. However, it uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" repeatedly, which is unnecessarily verbose. It also uses \"for projects\" instead of \"for investment projects,\" which is less precise.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is inconsistent with the original text. It also uses \"companies they have been accepted by,\" which is not a direct translation of \"invested companies\" and is awkward. The phrase \"in order to assist\" is less natural than \"thereby assisting.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This is one of the strongest translations. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently, \"public equity holdings\" from the dictionary, and \"long-term shareholder value,\" which is a standard financial term. It also uses \"by exercising voting rights and communicating with the invested companies,\" which is natural and precise.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is very similar to the fifth and is also strong. It uses \"publicly listed company stocks\" instead of \"public equity holdings,\" which is a valid alternative but slightly less precise. It also uses \"for investment projects\" instead of \"over investment projects,\" which is slightly less natural.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" consistently, use \"public equity holdings\" from the dictionary, and use natural, fluent English. It should also avoid unnecessary repetition and awkward phrasing. Based on this, the fifth translation is the strongest, but it can be slightly refined for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA appropriately exercises its shareholder rights over the public equity holdings of listed companies to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behavior, taking into account ESG factors, will help create long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects external investment managers to actively exercise ownership rights by exercising voting rights and communicating with the invested companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over investment projects.\n\n# Cooperation\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulatory institutions to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also attends public events and delivers speeches, sharing more refined ESG operational practices and encouraging the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nFor the original sentence, the key terms to be translated accurately are: \"內\" (in\/during the year), \"管理\" (management), \"負責任\" (Responsible Investment), \"一章\" (chapter), \"儲備\" (Reserves), \"投資\" (investment), \"年\" (year), \"方面\" (aspects), \"金\" (Payments), and \"工作\" (work\/activities). The dictionary provides multiple options for each, and the best choice depends on context and fluency.\n**Translation Review:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Responsible Investment\" and \"Reserve Management\" correctly. The sentence is fluent and natural.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"During the year\" is slightly wordy; \"this year\" or \"within the year\" might be more concise.  \n   - Note: \"HKMA\" is not used, but \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Reserve Management\" correctly. The structure is clear.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"See Chapter\" is abrupt and less formal than \"see the chapter titled.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Reserve Management\" correctly. The phrasing is natural and formal.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"For information on\" is slightly indirect; \"Details of\" might be more direct.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Reserves management\" correctly.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"HKMA\" is not defined, and \"chapter\" should be \"chapter titled\" for clarity. \"Reserves management\" should be \"Reserve Management\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Reserves management\" correctly.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Financial regulator\" is not accurate; \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is the correct term. \"Aspects\" is not needed here. \"This year\" is better than \"within the year.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"responsible investment\" and \"Reserve Management\" correctly.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Within the year\" is slightly awkward; \"during the year\" or \"this year\" is better.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, natural, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should avoid unnecessary words like \"aspects\" and use \"HKMA\" if appropriate. \"Reserve Management\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun. \"This year\" is more natural than \"during the year\" or \"within the year.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nDetails of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work on responsible investment this year can be found in the \"Reserve Management\" chapter.\n\n# The original text is:  \n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurate use of dictionary terms: \"HKMA\" (from \"金\"), \"active responsible investor\" (from \"主動的負責任投資者\"), \"monitors\" (from \"監察\"), \"external investment managers\" (from \"外聘投資經理\"), \"ESG practices\" (from \"ESG作業手法\").  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" is an abbreviation for Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but the original text uses \"金管局\" which is more accurately translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) rather than just \"HKMA\" without explanation. Also, \"ESG practices\" is a bit vague; \"ESG practices\" could be more precise as \"ESG operations\" or \"ESG methodologies.\"\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"# HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as Translation 1, but with the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The hashtag is not part of the original text and may be unnecessary. Also, same issues with \"HKMA\" and \"ESG practices.\"\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Same as above.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same issues with \"HKMA\" and \"ESG practices.\"\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority, serving as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of externally hired managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is more descriptive. \"Externally hired\" is a good alternative to \"external.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Monetary Authority\" is not the exact term for \"金管局,\" which is more accurately \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\" Also, \"ESG practices\" is still vague.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external investment managers.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is more accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The hashtag is unnecessary. \"ESG practices\" is still vague.\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The HKMA serves as an active responsible investor, monitoring external investment managers' ESG practices.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"serves as\" (from \"作為\"), which is a good alternative. \"Monitoring\" is a strong verb.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"HKMA\" is used without the full name. \"ESG practices\" is still vague.\n### Reasoning for Improved Translation:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" for clarity and accuracy.\n- \"主動的負責任投資者\" should be translated as \"active responsible investor\" or \"active responsible investor(s)\" to reflect the dictionary options.\n- \"監察\" is best translated as \"monitors\" or \"oversight\" depending on context.\n- \"外聘投資經理\" should be \"external investment managers\" or \"externally hired managers.\"\n- \"ESG作業手法\" should be translated as \"ESG operations\" or \"ESG methodologies\" to better reflect the nuance of \"作業手法\" (methods or practices).\n### Final Translation:\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG operations of external investment managers.\n\n# Payments Authority's Expectations\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, which is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) emphasis on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and actively exercising asset ownership. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"ESG factors\" and \"investment decisions.\"\n- The phrase \"actively exercising asset ownership\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary's \"active\" and \"ownership.\"\n- The term \"public equity holdings\" is used appropriately in several translations, matching the dictionary's \"company stocks.\"\n- The use of \"safeguarding the long-term value of investments\" is accurate and consistent with the dictionary's \"long-term\" and \"value.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first translation uses \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" consistently, which is more formal and appropriate than \"the Monetary Authority\" used in the sixth translation.\n- The third translation incorrectly uses \"appointed as investment managers\" instead of \"appointed investment managers.\"\n- The sixth translation uses \"will require\" instead of \"requires,\" which is less formal and less aligned with the original tone.\n- The third and sixth translations use \"managers\" without specifying \"investment,\" which is less precise than \"investment managers.\"\n- The term \"public equity holdings\" is more precise than \"listed company stocks,\" and should be used consistently.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure consistency in the full name of the authority: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- Use \"investment managers\" consistently, as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"public equity holdings\" instead of \"listed company stocks\" for accuracy.\n- Use \"requires\" instead of \"will require\" to maintain the formal tone.\n- Ensure that \"appointed investment managers\" is used correctly without unnecessary prepositions.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) emphasizes incorporating ESG factors into investment decisions and actively exercising asset ownership. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when appointing and monitoring external investment managers. Since the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights in its public equity holdings is a fundamental policy for safeguarding the long-term value of investments, it requires appointed investment managers to seriously address the active exercise of asset ownership.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's oversight.\n\nExternal investment managers must undergo assessment of their ESG performance in managing listed stock portfolios for the HKMA. The HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of external investment managers across different areas through a communication programme, such as their ESG assessment frameworks, communication with investee companies, and work related to proxy voting. In 2020, the HKMA selected a number of external investment managers to pilot the communication programme, which not only assessed their ESG performance but also examined whether they had properly exercised asset ownership on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Results\n\nThe original text discusses how the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) identified problematic external investment managers through a programme and took follow-up actions, with two examples provided. The translations by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"programme\" correctly. \"Operational practices\" is a good choice for \"手法.\" However, \"the following examples illustrate two of them\" is slightly wordy and less direct than alternatives.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"plan\" instead of \"programme,\" which is not the best match from the dictionary. Also, \"the following lists two examples among them\" is awkward and unclear.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"the programme\" correctly, but \"the following lists two examples\" is missing the word \"examples\" and is slightly abrupt.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is less precise. Also, \"took steps\" is acceptable, but \"the following are two examples\" is more direct than \"the following are two examples.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"its programme\" correctly and \"the following lists two examples\" is clear and concise. This is a strong translation.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"HKMA\" and \"programme\" correctly. However, \"took steps for follow-up actions\" is redundant and awkward. \"The following are two examples\" is acceptable but less precise than \"the following lists two examples.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" as the official name, \"programme\" as the correct term from the dictionary, and \"operational practices\" for \"手法.\" It should also use \"the following lists two examples\" for clarity and conciseness.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA identified external investment managers with problematic operational practices through its programme and took follow-up actions. The following lists two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators generally capture the core meaning of the original text but vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"ESG framework,\" \"external consultants,\" \"commitment,\" and \"senior management.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the main message about the improvements in A’s ESG framework is preserved.\n- Most translations use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" correctly, which is crucial for institutional clarity.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have awkward phrasing, such as \"closely monitors that stock investment manager A has room for improvement\" (Translation 3), which is grammatically incorrect. Others use \"followed up with A on this matter\" without specifying the action taken, which can be vague.\n- **Word Choice:** \"Companies under investment\" (Translation 4) is not idiomatic; \"invested companies\" or \"companies receiving investment\" is more natural. \"Opinions\" should be translated as \"feedback\" or \"views\" based on the dictionary, but Translation 5 uses \"opinions,\" which is less precise.\n- **Consistency:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which should be standardized.\n- **Tense and Voice:** Some translations use passive voice unnecessarily, such as \"was followed up with\" or \"was established,\" which can make the text feel less dynamic.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently as the official name.\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used accurately, such as \"commitment\" for \"決心\" and \"feedback\" for \"意見.\"\n- Use active voice where possible to enhance clarity and fluency.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure is natural in English, avoiding awkward phrasing or redundancy.\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone, as the text is about regulatory oversight and corporate governance.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA noted that Investment Manager A’s ESG framework has room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic approach to assess invested companies. The HKMA followed up with A on this matter, after which A conducted a comprehensive review of its company policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A further appointed external consultants to provide feedback on ESG procedures, reflecting a commitment to accelerate the implementation of reforms. A also established a new ESG Committee composed of senior management, demonstrating its commitment to ESG and the support of senior management for the related measures.\n\n# Case 2\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (e.g., \"HKMA,\" \"ESG manager\/supervisor\/head\") and the main points of the original text.\n- Most translations use the correct dictionary terms, such as \"review,\" \"deviating,\" \"strengthen,\" \"proxy voting guidelines,\" and \"voting against management.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"ESG manager\" but the dictionary lists \"head\" as an alternative. While \"manager\" is acceptable, \"head\" might be more precise in a corporate context.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"carry out a review\" instead of \"conduct a review,\" which is less idiomatic.\n- **Translation 3** uses \"HKMA\" but the original text refers to \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which should be used consistently.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"engagement\" instead of \"participation,\" which is a valid synonym but may not be the best fit in this context.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"shortcomings\" instead of \"deficiencies,\" which is a minor variation but acceptable.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"supervisor\" for \"主管,\" which is a valid alternative, but \"head\" might be more common in corporate governance contexts.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) consistently.\n- Use \"head\" for \"主管\" as it is more precise in a corporate governance context.\n- Use \"conduct a review\" instead of \"carry out a review\" for better fluency.\n- Use \"participation\" instead of \"engagement\" for \"參與\" in the context of team involvement.\n- Ensure that \"deficiencies\" is used consistently as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"major governance issues\" instead of \"key governance problems\" for better alignment with the original text.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, after reviewing the voting methods of stock investment manager B, found deficiencies in B's voting policy across multiple areas and requested its ESG head to conduct a review. Particularly, B had previously voted in favor of all management recommendations, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening the company's voting policy to meet expectations, which included increasing the participation of ESG team members and possibly voting against management in cases involving major governance issues.\n\nIn the private equity (PE) market investment area, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with relevant portfolio companies on ESG matters through its dedicated general partners, thereby achieving responsible investment. The HKMA closely monitors that dedicated general partners consistently demonstrate commitment to ESG, as they believe this approach can help create long-term value for portfolio companies and ensure the sustainability of returns. The following two examples show how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design modifications and the adoption of innovative operational technologies; and (ii) incorporating carbon reduction factors when constructing and operating green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions and avoiding harmful substances, while also enhancing operational efficiency by lowering costs and saving energy.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"採用\" as \"adopts,\" \"方案\" as \"plan,\" and \"淨\" as \"net.\"\n- The overall structure and meaning of the original text are preserved in all translations.\n- The use of terms like \"environmentally friendly,\" \"carbon emissions,\" and \"low-carbon industries\" is consistent and accurate.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations suffer from awkward phrasing or grammatical errors. For example, \"The Monetary Authority has investment in a company\" (Translation 5) is grammatically incorrect.\n- **Word Choice:** Some translations use less precise terms, such as \"plan\" instead of \"scheme\" or \"solution\" where context suggests a more comprehensive approach.\n- **Consistency:** There is inconsistency in the use of terms like \"remote detection\" versus \"remote monitoring\" or \"roadmap\" versus \"route planning.\"\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** Some translations use \"software publishing\" instead of \"software publishing,\" which is acceptable, but \"software publishing\" is not a standard industry term and could be better phrased as \"software publishing industry.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure grammatical correctness and fluency by reviewing sentence structures and word choices.\n- Use the most appropriate dictionary terms in context, such as \"scheme\" or \"solution\" for \"方案\" and \"roadmap\" for \"路線規劃.\"\n- Maintain consistency in terminology, especially for technical terms like \"dynamic sensors\" and \"carbon emissions.\"\n- Ensure that the final translation reads naturally in English while preserving the original meaning and nuance.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested in a pest control company that adopts an environmentally friendly scheme. Although traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively eliminate pests, if the dead pests are not promptly removed or properly disposed of, they will endanger public health. In addition, the leakage and disposal of chemical components can also cause environmental problems. The company adopts a scheme that does not use biocides, using traps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. The company also uses dynamic sensors connected to the internet to remotely detect whether pests have been captured. Through this new technology, the company can make refined route planning to collect captured pests, reducing travel distance and thus lowering carbon emissions. The company's adopted scheme results in a net carbon impact of 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales, which is a low level close to the average of low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing, which is truly encouraging.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammar, vocabulary, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"green,\" \"net-zero carbon emission,\" \"solar thermal systems,\" and \"sustainable.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is mostly clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms for \"construction industry,\" \"warehouse developers,\" and \"carbon emissions.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations have grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. For example, \"The Monetary Authority has investment in Green and sustainable warehouses\" (Translation 2) is grammatically incorrect. It should be \"has made an investment in\" or \"has invested in.\"\n- **Word Choice:** \"The Monetary Authority\" should be \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for consistency, as the dictionary lists \"金\" as \"Payments,\" which is not appropriate in this context. However, \"HKMA\" is the correct term for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n- **Redundancy and Repetition:** Some translations repeat phrases unnecessarily, such as \"have adopted... have formulated\" (Translation 3), which can be streamlined.\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"HKMA\" is more appropriate than \"The Monetary Authority\" in this context, as it is the official name of the institution in Hong Kong.\n- **Consistency in Terminology:** Some translations use \"with sustainable characteristics\" (Translation 2 and 5), which is grammatically incorrect. It should be \"with sustainable features\" or \"possess sustainable characteristics.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" instead of \"The Monetary Authority\" for accuracy.\n- Ensure correct grammar and fluency.\n- Use the dictionary terms accurately, such as \"net-zero carbon emission procedures,\" \"solar thermal systems,\" and \"sustainable.\"\n- Avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.\n**Improved Translation:**\n(ii) The HKMA has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted net-zero carbon emission procedures in their overall warehouse construction and operations, and have formulated standards and metrics to measure net-zero carbon emission benchmarks. The construction plans also take into account the sustainability of the materials and components used. Therefore, the constructed warehouses have high carbon reduction efficiency and are equipped with sustainable features, including solar thermal systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural lighting, and rainwater collection.\n\nAccording to an independent assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse construction, on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than the carbon emissions of a typical logistics building. To further offset the carbon emissions caused by the construction project, 32,799 trees were planted during the construction process (on a net basis). After completion, the daily operations of the warehouse produce 26.9% less carbon emissions than those of a typical warehouse.\n"}

意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n","terms":{"月":["month"],"暢順":["smooth"],"前":["ahead"],"幣作":["currency"],"銀行":["bank","banking","banks","bank(s)","banking

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary (FS)\n\n# Feedback\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") listed on pages 187 to 289, which include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and the income and expenditure accounts, comprehensive income statements, statements of changes in equity, and statements of cash flows for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of major accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and they truly and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# The Basis of Opinion\n**Review of Translations:**\nThe original text is \"# 意見的基礎\", which translates to \"The Basis of Opinion\" or \"The Foundation of Opinion.\" The dictionary provides several options for \"基礎\" (foundation, infrastructure, Monetary Base, base, basis, basic) and \"意見\" (feedback, views, opinion). The translations provided by junior translators vary in quality and adherence to the dictionary.\n1. **\"the foundation of opinion\"** – This is grammatically correct but lacks the article \"The\" at the beginning, which is standard in English titles. It also uses \"foundation\" instead of \"basis,\" which is a valid option but may not be the most natural in this context.\n2. **\"The Basis of Opinions\"** – This is grammatically correct and uses \"Basis\" from the dictionary. However, \"Opinions\" is plural, while the original uses \"意見\" (opinion), which is singular. This may be a minor inconsistency.\n3. **\"Foundation of Opinion\"** – Similar to the first translation, it lacks the article \"The\" and uses \"Foundation\" instead of \"Basis.\" It is concise but not fully natural in English as a title.\n4. **\"The foundation of opinion.\"** – This is nearly identical to the first translation but includes a period at the end, making it a complete sentence rather than a title. It is grammatically correct but stylistically inconsistent with the original.\n5. **\"The basis of the feedback.\"** – This translation uses \"feedback\" for \"意見,\" which is an alternative in the dictionary, but \"feedback\" is not the most accurate translation for \"意見\" in this context. It also uses \"the\" before \"feedback,\" which is unnecessary in a title.\n6. **\"# Basis of Opinion\"** – This is the most accurate translation. It uses \"Basis\" from the dictionary and \"Opinion\" for \"意見.\" It also retains the hashtag from the original, which is appropriate if the original is intended as a heading or title.\n**Reasoning for Improved Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most natural English equivalents from the dictionary. \"Basis\" is more commonly used in titles than \"foundation,\" and \"Opinion\" is more direct than \"Opinions\" or \"feedback.\" The hashtag should be retained if it is part of the original formatting.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# The Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a thorough review of the six translations provided. Overall, they are quite similar in content and structure, but there are notable differences in terminology, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\nStrengths across all translations include accurate rendering of the core message, proper use of formal tone, and correct application of terms like \"audit,\" \"audit standards,\" and \"independent.\" However, several weaknesses stand out:\n1. **Terminology Consistency with Dictionary**: \n   - The term \"審計\" is translated as \"audit\" in most translations, which is correct. However, \"審計師\" should be \"auditor\" rather than \"auditing\" or \"audit.\"\n   - \"報告\" is translated as \"report\" in most cases, which is correct, but \"審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\" should be \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\" (using \"financial statements\" from the dictionary).\n   - \"意見\" is translated as \"opinion\" in most translations, which is correct.\n   - \"獨立\" is consistently translated as \"independent,\" which is correct.\n   - \"發出\" is translated as \"issued\" or \"issued by,\" which is correct.\n   - \"條例\" is translated as \"Ordinance,\" which is correct.\n   - \"條下\" is translated as \"under section,\" which is correct.\n   - \"準則\" is translated as \"standards\" or \"principles,\" which is correct.\n   - \"集團\" is translated as \"the Group,\" which is correct.\n   - \"基礎\" is translated as \"basis\" or \"foundation,\" which is correct.\n   - \"提供\" is translated as \"provide\" or \"provides,\" which is correct.\n   - \"充足\" is translated as \"adequate,\" which is correct.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - The fourth translation has a grammatical error: \"have fulfilling\" should be \"have fulfilled.\"\n   - The fifth translation uses \"Auditor General\" instead of \"Audit Commission\" or \"Audit Department,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be inaccurate.\n   - The third translation uses \"in accordance with these standards\" repeatedly, which is slightly repetitive.\n   - The first and second translations are the most fluent and grammatically sound.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**:\n   - All translations maintain a formal tone appropriate for an audit report.\n   - The use of \"the Group\" for \"集團\" is appropriate in this context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Audit Commission\" or \"Audit Department\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"financial statements\" for \"財務報表.\"\n- Use \"auditor\" for \"審計師.\"\n- Use \"opinion\" for \"意見.\"\n- Use \"independent\" for \"獨立.\"\n- Use \"issued\" for \"發出.\"\n- Use \"Ordinance\" for \"條例.\"\n- Use \"under section\" for \"條下.\"\n- Use \"standards\" for \"準則.\"\n- Use \"the Group\" for \"集團.\"\n- Use \"basis\" for \"基礎.\"\n- Use \"provide\" for \"提供.\"\n- Use \"adequate\" for \"充足.\"\nBased on this, the best translation would combine the strengths of the first, second, and sixth translations, while ensuring full adherence to the dictionary and grammatical accuracy.\n---\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the guidance issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. The responsibilities I must assume in accordance with these standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is adequate and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters, as determined by my professional judgment, that are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the course of auditing the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information in the Financial Management Authority's 2020 annual report, but does not include the financial statements or my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other data.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have already performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no reports.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of an audit committee under specific authorities regarding financial statements. The dictionary provides precise translation options for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to render the title into English, though with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is concise and uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" correctly. However, \"under\" is used in a way that may not fully capture the hierarchical relationship implied by \"轄下.\" Also, \"in relation to\" is slightly vague compared to \"with respect to\" or \"regarding.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"Employees\" for \"員\" (which should be \"Committee\" or \"Committees\" in this context) and \"Consultation Committee\" instead of \"Advisory Committee.\" The term \"under\" is used correctly, but the overall structure is awkward and lacks clarity.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation misinterprets \"金融管理員\" as \"financial management officers\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner\" or \"Financial Management Committee.\" It also incorrectly uses \"Financial Consultation Committee\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Consultation Committee.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation misplaces \"Financial Management Specialist\" instead of \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and incorrectly uses \"regarding\" instead of \"with respect to.\" The structure is also slightly off.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Management Officer\" instead of \"Commissioner\" and \"responsibility for financial statements and commitments\" is awkward and unclear. \"Commitments\" is not the best fit for \"承擔\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation correctly uses \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and \"Exchange Fund Consultation Committee.\" However, \"regarding the responsibility for the financial statements\" is awkward and redundant.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Financial Management Commissioner\" for \"金融管理員.\"\n- Use \"Audit Committee\" for \"審核委員會.\"\n- Use \"Exchange Fund Consultation Committee\" for \"外匯基金諮詢委員會.\"\n- Use \"with respect to\" or \"regarding\" for \"就...而.\"\n- Use \"financial statements\" for \"財務報表.\"\n- Use \"under\" for \"轄下.\"\n- Use \"responsibility\" for \"責任.\"\n- Avoid redundancy and awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibility of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Commissioner and the Exchange Fund Consultation Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the guidance issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and for using the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee, under the Foreign Exchange Fund Consultation Committee, is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Accurately uses \"Audit Committee\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is not the most concise or standard term from the dictionary. \"Exchange Fund\" is more appropriate. Also, \"under\" is correctly used, but the structure could be more natural.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Consultation Committee is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of the Group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"financial reporting process of the Group.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"of the Group\" is slightly awkward; \"the Group's\" is more natural in English.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee is responsible for supervising the Group’s financial reporting processes.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" and \"financial reporting processes.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Advisory Committee\" may not be the exact term for \"諮詢委員會\" in this context. Also, \"processes\" is plural, but the original uses \"過程\" (singular).\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee is responsible for supervising the Group’s Financial report process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Financial report process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Financial report process\" is awkward and not idiomatic. \"Financial reporting process\" is better.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's Review Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Review Committee\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Review Committee\" is incorrect; the original says \"審核委員會,\" which should be \"Audit Committee.\"\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Consultation Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Audit Committee,\" \"Exchange Fund,\" and \"financial reporting process.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Consultation Committee\" may not be the best match for \"諮詢委員會.\" \"Advisory Committee\" is more standard in such contexts.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"外匯基金\" should be translated as \"Exchange Fund\" (from the dictionary).\n- \"諮詢委員會\" is best translated as \"Advisory Committee.\"\n- \"審核委員會\" is \"Audit Committee.\"\n- \"負責\" is best translated as \"is responsible for.\"\n- \"監督\" is best translated as \"supervising.\"\n- \"財務報告過程\" is best translated as \"financial reporting process.\"\n### Final Translation:\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor's Responsibility in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material misstatements if, individually or in aggregate, they are likely to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.\n\nIn reviewing the six translations, several observations can be made regarding their strengths and weaknesses. All translations generally capture the core meaning of the original text, which outlines the auditor's responsibilities and procedures in accordance with audit standards. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the provided dictionary.\nThe first translation is accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms such as \"audit evidence\" and \"material misstatements.\" It correctly uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"going concern basis of accounting.\" However, it uses \"non-unqualified auditor's report,\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"non-unqualified opinion.\"\nThe second translation uses \"Financial Secretary\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer,\" which is a deviation from the dictionary and may be incorrect. It also uses \"qualified audit report\" instead of \"non-unqualified,\" which is a minor inconsistency.\nThe third translation is very close to the first, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"Financial Management Officer\" correctly and \"non-unqualified opinion\" appropriately.\nThe fourth translation is similar to the third, with slight variations in phrasing. It uses \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"non-unqualified auditor's report,\" which is slightly less precise than \"non-unqualified opinion.\"\nThe fifth translation uses \"Feedback\" for \"意見\" (opinion), which is incorrect according to the dictionary. It also uses \"Financial Management Specialist\" instead of \"Financial Management Officer,\" which is a deviation. Additionally, it uses \"qualified audit report\" instead of \"non-unqualified.\"\nThe sixth translation is the most consistent with the dictionary, using \"Financial Management Officer\" and \"non-unqualified auditor's report.\" It also uses \"going concern basis of accounting\" correctly and maintains a high level of fluency and accuracy.\nBased on this review, the best translation would maintain the accuracy of the sixth translation, use \"non-unqualified opinion\" instead of \"non-unqualified auditor's report\" for consistency with accounting terminology, and ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly.\nIn producing the best possible translation, it is important to ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used as specified, maintain a natural and fluent English structure, and use standard accounting terminology where appropriate.\nIn summary, the best translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the translations, ensuring that all dictionary terms are used correctly and that the final translation reads naturally in English.\nHere is the improved translation:\nIn the course of conducting an audit in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risk that the financial statements may contain material misstatements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Financial Management Officer are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's practice of using the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in relation to events or circumstances. If I consider that there are material uncertainties, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events;\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and time of the programme, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit period.\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and time of the programme, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as relevant preventive measures where applicable.\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as relevant preventive measures where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations provided, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. Overall, the translations are reasonably accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are inconsistencies in terminology, grammatical structures, and fluency that can be improved.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key components of the original text, such as the \"Audit Committee,\" \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" \"financial statements,\" and \"key audit matters.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate terms like \"public disclosure,\" \"negative consequences,\" and \"public interest.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"Review Committee\" instead of \"Audit Committee,\" which is not consistent with the dictionary entry for \"審核委員會\" (Audit Committee). Similarly, \"Consultation Committee\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary specifies \"Advisory Committee\" as a possible translation for \"諮詢委員會.\"\n- **Grammar and Fluency:** Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"because there is a reasonable anticipated that the negative consequences...\" (Translation 5), which is grammatically incorrect. Others use passive voice unnecessarily, reducing clarity.\n- **Use of \"Items\" vs. \"Matters\":** Some translations use \"items\" instead of \"matters,\" which is not ideal in this context. The dictionary provides \"item\" as an alternative for \"項,\" but \"matters\" is more appropriate in the context of audit reporting.\n- **\"Financial\" Capitalization:** Some translations capitalize \"Financial\" in \"Financial statements\" inconsistently, which should be lowercase unless it's part of a proper noun.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"Audit Committee\" consistently, as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Advisory Committee\" for \"諮詢委員會\" and \"Exchange Fund\" for \"外匯基金.\"\n- Use \"matters\" rather than \"items\" for \"事項\" and \"項.\"\n- Ensure \"financial statements\" is lowercase unless it's part of a proper noun.\n- Improve sentence structure for clarity and fluency, avoiding awkward phrasing and unnecessary passive voice.\n**Improved Translation:**\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for this period and thus constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit the public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, where I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest, and therefore decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nAuditor-General  \nZhu Nai-chang  \nThe term \"審計署署長\" should be translated as \"Auditor-General,\" which is the most appropriate and commonly used title for the head of an audit office in official contexts. The dictionary provides \"audit,\" \"auditor,\" and \"auditing\" for \"審計,\" and \"Long-Term,\" \"long,\" \"long-term,\" and \"elderly\" for \"長.\" However, \"長\" in this context refers to a position or title, not a duration or age, so \"Auditor-General\" is the most accurate and natural choice.\nThe name \"朱乃璋\" is correctly transliterated as \"Zhu Nai-chang\" or \"Zhu Nai Zhang,\" depending on the preferred romanization system. The most common and widely accepted form is \"Zhu Nai-chang.\" The other variations, such as \"Zhu Naizhang\" or \"Chu Nai Zhang,\" are either inconsistent with standard transliteration rules or use incorrect initials.\nAmong the junior translators' attempts, the first and fourth translations are the most accurate, using \"Auditor-General\" and correctly transliterating the name. However, the fourth translation uses \"Zhu Nai-zhang,\" which is less standard than \"Zhu Nai-chang.\" The second and fifth translations use \"Director of the Audit Office\" and \"Director of the Audit Department,\" which are less precise than \"Auditor-General.\" The third and sixth translations use \"Auditor General of the Audit Department\" and \"Auditor General,\" which are close but not as precise as \"Auditor-General.\"\nThe best possible translation would be \"Auditor-General Zhu Nai-chang,\" which accurately reflects the title and name in a natural and official manner.\n\nApril 1, 2021\nThe original text is a simple date: \"2021年4月1日.\" The dictionary provides several options for translating the numerals and the characters for \"year\" and \"month.\" The junior translators have all produced translations that are grammatically correct and fluent in English. However, there are a few points worth noting:\n- The date format in English typically follows the order \"Month Day, Year,\" which all translations have correctly used.\n- The use of \"1st\" in the sixth translation is stylistically acceptable but not necessary, as \"1\" is equally valid and more commonly used in formal or written contexts.\n- The dictionary provides \"year\" and \"years\" as options for \"年.\" In this context, \"year\" is the more appropriate choice since it is used with a specific year (2021).\n- The numerals \"2,\" \"4,\" and \"1\" are provided with both numeric and word forms. In this case, using the numeric form is more standard for dates.\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate translation is \"April 1, 2021.\"\n\n# 1 Major Business Activities\n\nThe original text outlines the role of the Financial Management Officer in managing the Exchange Fund under the authority of the Financial Secretary, in accordance with the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). It also describes the Fund’s primary functions: safeguarding the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** The use of “FS” for “Financial Secretary” is inconsistent and confusing. The phrase “acting in the capacity of manager of the Exchange Fund (Fund) under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary” is awkward and unclear. The term “stability and soundness” is accurate, but the overall structure is not fluent.\n2. **Second Translation:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It correctly uses “Financial Management Officer” and “Financial Secretary (FS)” and accurately reflects the legal structure. The phrase “maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system” is well phrased and natural.\n3. **Third Translation:** The phrase “in their identity as the Exchange Fund manager apart from the Financial Secretary” is awkward and misrepresents the original meaning. The use of “HK$” instead of “Hong Kong dollar” is acceptable but less formal. The term “currency and financial system” is slightly less precise than “monetary and financial system.”\n4. **Fourth Translation:** The structure is clear, but the sentence “The Financial Secretary, as the Exchange Fund (Fund) Manager, delegates authority to the Financial Management Officer” misrepresents the original, which states that the Financial Secretary grants authority to the Financial Management Officer, not that the Financial Secretary is the Fund Manager.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** The phrase “under the authority granted by the Financial Secretary (FS) as the Fund's manager” is slightly off. The original text says the Financial Secretary grants authority to the Financial Management Officer in the capacity of Fund manager, not that the Financial Secretary is the Fund manager.\n6. **Sixth Translation:** This is very close to the best version. It correctly uses “Financial Management Officer” and “Financial Secretary (FS).” The phrase “exercises powers conferred upon him in the capacity of manager of the Exchange Fund (Fund) by the Financial Secretary” is slightly wordy but accurate. The use of “monetary and financial system” is appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe second translation is the most accurate and fluent, with the correct use of terms and a natural flow. It correctly identifies the Financial Management Officer as the one exercising the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary (FS) as the Fund’s manager. It also uses “stability and soundness” and “monetary and financial system,” which are precise and appropriate.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Management Officer exercises the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary (FS) as the manager of the Exchange Fund (Fund) in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The Fund's main business is to safeguard the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the four portfolios and their respective functions.\n- The term \"Currency Board\" is consistently used for \"發行局,\" which aligns with the dictionary.\n- The term \"strategic\" is appropriately used for \"策略性.\"\n- The term \"portfolio\" is consistently used for \"組合,\" which is correct.\n- Most translations correctly use \"monetary base\" for \"貨幣基礎.\"\n- The term \"Fund\" is capitalized appropriately in several translations, which is good for consistency.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use inconsistent capitalization for \"Fund\" (e.g., \"fund\" vs. \"Fund\").\n- The term \"OECD\" is not consistently used; some translations use \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" while others use \"Economic Cooperation and Development Organization.\"\n- The term \"Note 32\" is sometimes written as \"note 32\" without capitalization, which is inconsistent.\n- Some translations use \"Operating segment data\" while others use \"Information on the operating segments,\" which is less precise.\n- The term \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" is sometimes incorrectly translated as \"Hong Kong Exchange Fund Limited.\"\n- The term \"included in the fund's accounts\" is sometimes translated as \"included in the Fund’s account\" (singular), which is grammatically incorrect.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- Use \"Fund\" consistently with a capital \"F\" when referring to the specific entity.\n- Use \"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\" consistently.\n- Ensure \"Note 32\" is capitalized consistently.\n- Use \"Operating segment information\" for \"經營分部資料\" to maintain consistency and clarity.\n- Correctly use \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\" as per the dictionary.\n- Ensure \"included in the Fund’s accounts\" is used with the correct plural form.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Fund's assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. According to Hong Kong's Currency Board system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully aligned with the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bonds and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for strategic purposes and are included in the Fund's accounts. Operating segment information is presented in Note 32.\n\n# 2 Major Accounting Policies\n\n# 2.1 Statement of Compliance with Principles\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (which is a comprehensive term including all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards, and interpretations issued by the HKAB) and Hong Kong Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Highlights of the major accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as \"the Group\") are as follows.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Accountants (HKAB) has issued several new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which took effect for the first time in the Group's current accounting period or are available for early adoption. Changes in the Group's accounting policies resulting from the first adoption of applicable standards (if any) during the current and prior accounting periods are reflected in these financial statements, with the related information included in Note 3.\n\n# 2.2 The Basis for the Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe Group's financial statements include the Group's financial statements, as well as the Group's equity interests in associates and joint ventures. The main business activities of major subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are presented in Notes 17 and 18.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value:  \n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value and included in the income and expenditure account (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets measured at fair value and included in other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);  \n- Gold (Note 2.10); and  \n- Investment property (Note 2.11).\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards,\" \"management,\" \"assets,\" \"liabilities,\" \"estimates,\" \"assumptions,\" and \"actual values.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"formulated based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the circumstances\" is a strong and consistent phrasing across several translations.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Presentation of amounts\" vs. \"reported amounts\":** The first and fourth translations use \"presentation of amounts,\" which is less precise than \"reported amounts\" or \"amounts reported,\" as used in translations 2, 3, and 5.\n- **\"Carrying amounts\" vs. \"carrying values\":** The term \"carrying amounts\" is more commonly used in financial reporting than \"carrying values,\" as seen in translations 1, 2, and 5.\n- **\"Benchmark\" vs. \"basis\":** The fourth and sixth translations use \"benchmark,\" which is not the most natural term in this context. \"Basis\" is more appropriate, as used in translations 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n- **\"Expenditure\" vs. \"expenses\":** The original text uses \"支出,\" which is best translated as \"expenses\" in this context, as seen in translations 2, 3, and 5.\n- **\"In the absence of other readily available data\":** This phrase is well-used in translations 2, 3, and 5, and is more natural than \"in the absence of other available data\" used in translations 1 and 4.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"reported amounts\" instead of \"presentation of amounts\" for clarity and precision.\n- Use \"carrying amounts\" instead of \"carrying values\" to align with standard financial terminology.\n- Use \"basis\" instead of \"benchmark\" for the phrase \"as the basis for determining.\"\n- Use \"expenses\" instead of \"expenditure\" for consistency with financial reporting standards.\n- Ensure that the phrase \"in the absence of other readily available data\" is used for fluency and clarity.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nPreparing financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions affect the adoption of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Such estimates and related assumptions are formulated based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the relevant circumstances. In the absence of other readily available data, these estimates and assumptions are adopted as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The estimated results may differ from their actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions made affect only the current accounting period, the revisions will be recognized during that period. However, if the revisions affect this period and future accounting periods, the revisions will be recognized during this period and in future periods.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators vary in quality and accuracy. The first and fifth translations are the most accurate and fluent, correctly using terms such as \"recognized\" for \"確認\" and \"revisions\" for \"修訂.\" They also maintain the correct structure and meaning of the original text. The second translation is also strong, though it uses \"recognised\" with an's' which is acceptable in British English but may be less common in American English. The third and sixth translations contain grammatical errors, such as \"will continued review and amend\" which should be \"will be continued to be reviewed and amended.\" The fourth translation uses \"confirmed\" for \"確認,\" which is not the best fit in this context, as \"confirmed\" implies verification rather than the accounting recognition intended. \nThe best possible translation should use \"recognized\" for \"確認\" and \"revisions\" for \"修訂,\" as these terms are most appropriate in the context of accounting. It should also maintain the correct structure and flow of the original text, ensuring that the meaning is accurately conveyed in natural, fluent English.\n\nThe original sentence discusses the disclosure in Note 2.19 of the judgments and estimates made by management in adopting Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a significant impact on financial statements and involve uncertainty.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"significant impact\" and \"main sources of uncertainty.\" However, it slightly misrepresents the original by implying that the judgments are \"made by management in adopting\" the standards, rather than \"made by management in adopting the standards.\" It also uses \"disclosed in Note 2.19\" correctly.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is concise and clear. It captures the main idea but omits the reference to the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which is an important detail in the original text.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second, with the same omission of the reference to the standards. It is fluent but lacks a key element from the original.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It uses \"adopts the significant judgments made in accordance with\" which misrepresents the original. Also, \"main Sources of estimation uncertainty\" is unnecessarily capitalized and awkwardly phrased.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is confusing. It uses \"Management levels made judgments\" which is unclear. It also incorrectly translates \"準則\" as \"principles\" instead of \"standards\" and uses \"noted in note 2.19\" which is less precise than \"disclosed in Note 2.19.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is concise but omits the reference to the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the \"main sources of uncertainty\" part, making it incomplete.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should include all key elements: the judgments and estimates made by management, the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, the significant impact on financial statements, and the disclosure in Note 2.19. It should also use natural English and avoid awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nManagement's judgments and estimates, made in adopting Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and having a significant impact on the financial statements, as well as the major sources of uncertainty, are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n\nSeveral of the junior translations are quite close to an optimal version, but there are notable differences in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary. Here's a critical review:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"align with\" which is a natural fit for \"配合\" in this context. It correctly uses \"financial statements\" from the dictionary and \"presentation method\" for \"方式.\" However, \"comparative figures\" is slightly more formal than \"comparative numbers\" or \"figures,\" but still acceptable.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"presentation format\" for \"方式,\" which is slightly different from the dictionary's \"method,\" but still acceptable. The use of \"for this year\" is slightly more natural than \"for this year's\" in this context.\n3. **Translation 3** is nearly identical to Translation 1, with the only difference being the use of \"some\" instead of \"certain.\" Both are acceptable, but \"certain\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n4. **Translation 4** uses \"complement\" for \"配合,\" which is a valid dictionary option but less precise in this context. \"Complement\" implies adding to something rather than aligning with it, which slightly changes the meaning.\n5. **Translation 5** uses \"classified\" instead of \"reclassified,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"reporting way\" for \"方式,\" which is awkward and not idiomatic in English.\n6. **Translation 6** is very close to the best version. It uses \"support\" for \"配合,\" which is a valid dictionary option, and \"annual financial statements\" for \"年度財務報表,\" which is accurate. However, \"support\" is slightly less precise than \"align with\" or \"in accordance with.\"\n**Reasoning for improvement:** The best translation should use \"reclassified\" for \"重新分類,\" \"in accordance with\" for \"配合,\" and \"financial statements\" for \"報表.\" It should also use \"for this year\" or \"for the current year\" for \"本年度.\" The use of \"certain\" or \"some\" is acceptable, but \"certain\" is slightly more formal and precise.\n**Improved Translation:**\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified in accordance with the presentation method of the Group's financial statements for this year.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiary Companies and Non-controlling Interests\n\nA subsidiary refers to an entity controlled by the Group. If the Group, through its participation in the operations of the entity, is exposed to risks of variable returns or has rights to those returns, and has the ability to exercise power over the entity to affect those returns, then it is deemed to have control over that entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only the substantial rights held by the Group and other parties are considered.\n"}
