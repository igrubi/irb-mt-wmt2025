{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

\"black swan\" events. Although the outcomes of the UK's Brexit referendum and the US presidential election rendered various polls laughable, what was even more unexpected was the reaction of financial markets. Taking the US election as an example, news of Trump's election victory led to an immediate plunge in the futures of the three major US stock indices before the market opened. However, shortly after the market opened, the US stock indices quickly rebounded and subsequently trended upward, repeatedly setting new highs. This series of events highlights the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market resilience, and also marks the significant uncertainty in the development of global situations in the future.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial data points have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiments: the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36 basis points in July, then surged to 2.6 basis points in mid-December following the US presidential election. The US Dollar Index, which reflects the movement of the US dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end; New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the start of the year to $54 per barrel by year-end. In terms of Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, but the difference between its peak and trough during the period exceeded 6,000 points. With turbulent external conditions, the importance and value of maintaining stability in the financial system, especially in the monetary and banking systems, have become even more evident.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors swirled that international hedge funds were deploying strategies to target the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar, causing widespread anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority promptly issued clear and firm messages to the market, emphasizing that we have absolute confidence and capability to defend the linked exchange rate system and ensure the stability of Hong Kong's financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence in a timely manner. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained closely aligned with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee for an extended period. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, even though the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2015 and March 2016, there was no immediate significant impact on the Hong Kong dollar's interest rates or exchange rates.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"穩步\" as \"steadily,\" \"貸款\" as \"loans,\" \"資產質素\" as \"asset quality,\" and \"緩衝\" as \"Buffer.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the original meaning.\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"non-performing loan ratio\" and \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"will continue steadily developing\" which is grammatically awkward and does not match the original tone.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"mild growth\" which is less precise than \"moderate growth\" or \"6.5% growth.\"\n- **Translation 3** is fluent and accurate, but \"the banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio have both remained\" is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"Buffer\" with a capital \"B,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry and should be lowercase.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"repayment-to-income ratio\" instead of \"debt-to-income ratio,\" which is less standard in financial contexts.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, but \"modest growth\" is slightly less precise than \"moderate growth.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\n- The best version should use \"moderate growth\" for \"溫和增長\" as it is more standard in financial reporting.\n- \"Buffer\" should be lowercase as per the dictionary.\n- \"Debt-to-income ratio\" is the standard term and should be used consistently.\n- The sentence structure should be concise and grammatically correct, avoiding redundancy.\n- The phrase \"in the face of shocks should the property market cycle reverse\" is more natural than \"should the property market reverse and shocks the banking system.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to develop steadily. Overall loans recorded a moderate growth of 6.5% last year, with asset quality remaining good and the non-performing loan ratio maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, well below the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio have both remained at high levels above statutory requirements. In the residential mortgage business, after seven rounds of counter-cyclical measures, the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential property mortgages declined from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer in the face of shocks should the property market cycle reverse. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the development of the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain banking system stability.\n\nFurther legislative work to strengthen the banking system's stability made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation—aimed at optimizing the Deposit Protection Scheme and addressing the \"too big to fail\" risks of financial institutions—were smoothly passed before the previous Legislative Council term ended. The former quickens the payout of deposit protection funds and simplifies the payout process, helping to enhance depositors' confidence in the banking system; the latter establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks that may arise should these institutions fail, and to the extent possible, avoid using public funds to bail them out. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has already established a resolution mechanism office on April 1 of this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and oversee follow-up work.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the banking sector as \"the mother of all industries\" and convey the role of banking in the real economy and daily life.\n- Most translations accurately reflect the actions taken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), including communication with the banking sector and promotion of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.\n- The translations generally maintain the structure and flow of the original text, with only minor variations in phrasing.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** uses \"remains at a crucial channel\" which is awkward and not idiomatic in English.\n- **Translation 2** also uses \"mis-understanding\" and \"misinterpret\" as separate terms, which is inconsistent and not in line with the dictionary entry for \"誤解\" (misunderstanding).\n- **Translation 4** uses \"credit Source\" with a capital \"S,\" which is unnecessary and inconsistent with the dictionary entry for \"來源\" (source).\n- **Translation 4** also uses \"sMe Financing\" with lowercase \"s\" and uppercase \"M,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary entry for \"企融\" (SME Financing).\n- **Translation 5** and **Translation 6** use \"credit facilities\" which is a more natural and precise term than \"credit amount\" or \"credit limit\" in this context.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"program\" instead of \"scheme\" for the SME Financing Guarantee Plan, which is less precise than \"scheme\" or \"programme\" as per the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use natural, idiomatic English.\n- Adhere strictly to the dictionary terms.\n- Maintain clarity and fluency.\n- Use consistent terminology, especially for key terms like \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" and \"credit facilities.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the various translations while ensuring consistency with the dictionary and natural English usage.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe banking sector is known as \"the mother of all industries\" and serves as a vital channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the general public's daily lives. During the year, some representatives from the SME sector reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority immediately communicated with the banking sector, hoping that banks would continue to provide funding support for SMEs' operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also strengthened the promotion of the government's \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business community through our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, and maintained close communication with the banking sector to dispel doubts, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the scheme. Through these multi-pronged measures, certain results have been achieved. According to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the overall credit facilities for SMEs remained stable last year, with credit limits maintained or even increased for over 90% of companies. Meanwhile, the number of applications for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" also rose significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become an essential part of business operations and daily life. Last year, when we learned that some overseas companies and startups were encountering difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately initiated follow-up work, contacting a number of international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth communication with the banking sector to address the issues effectively. In September last year, I issued a notice to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how to understand the HKMA's \"risk-based\" regulatory principles aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and how to apply these principles to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing customers. I emphasized that banks should not adopt a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for all customers. After consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but there is still room for further progress, which remains one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking service needs of the public while pursuing business profits. With the rapid development of fintech, the channels through which banks provide services have become more diversified. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, several banks launched mobile banking units or video teller machines last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our promotion, several banks also plan to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial centre is like rowing upstream, and therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been continuously seeking new opportunities and exploring new areas for the development of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 was a year of significant achievements, with fintech and infrastructure financing standing out as highlights.\n\nIn the field of fintech, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value payment facilities licenses, creating a conducive business environment for retail payment services through licensing and a regulatory regime, accompanied by a series of public education and publicity campaigns, ensuring that consumers enjoy the convenience brought by new technology while their rights are properly protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office, using this platform to promote the development of fintech related to the banking sector. Within several months, we launched multiple new initiatives, including the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" establishing a new platform with three pillars—risk assessment, information sharing, and talent development—to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in the Hong Kong banking sector, and established the Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking sector and fintech industry. The Monetary Authority's banking supervisory department also set up the \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" allowing banks to test new technologies in a smaller and controlled scope, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have already used the sandbox to test 14 new technology projects, with some projects subsequently launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Infrastructure financing\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding.\" However, it uses \"Infrastructure\" redundantly and repeats the term unnecessarily.\n2. **Translation 2** is well-structured and uses appropriate terms. It correctly uses \"infrastructure financing\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding.\" However, it uses \"inside and outside China\" which is slightly less precise than \"both China and abroad.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the ideal version. It uses \"infrastructure financing\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding\" correctly. It also uses \"unique advantage\" which is a good match for \"優勢.\" However, it uses \"infrastructure investment and financing issues\" which is slightly less natural than \"infrastructure investment and financing subjects.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is accurate and uses \"infrastructure financing\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding\" correctly. It also uses \"infrastructure investment and financing\" consistently. However, it repeats \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office\" unnecessarily.\n5. **Translation 5** is accurate but uses \"asset owners\" instead of \"institutional investors,\" which is not the best match for \"投資者.\" It also uses \"infrastructure investment and financing issues\" which is slightly less natural than \"infrastructure investment and financing subjects.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is accurate and uses \"infrastructure financing\" and \"Memorandums of Understanding\" correctly. It also uses \"infrastructure investment and financing\" consistently. However, it uses \"infrastructure investment and financing activities\" which is slightly less natural than \"infrastructure investment and financing.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"infrastructure financing\" consistently, \"Memorandums of Understanding\" correctly, and avoid redundancy. It should also use \"infrastructure investment and financing subjects\" for \"課題\" and \"infrastructure investment and financing\" for \"投融資.\"\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe global demand for infrastructure financing is substantial, especially since the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative, making infrastructure financing a focal topic of interest both domestically and internationally. As Asia's international financial center, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in the field of infrastructure financing. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a new and unique platform to bring together over 60 world-class multilateral institutions, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as developers and operators of infrastructure projects and various professional institutions, to exchange information, share experiences, and seek cooperation opportunities regarding infrastructure investment and financing subjects. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than ten large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its operational period is relatively short, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future role as a center for infrastructure investment and financing.\n\nBreaking down barriers is the surest way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participated in and supported the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in amending the Inland Revenue Ordinance, providing a favorable tax environment for companies operating internal treasury activities within Hong Kong. We also actively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial markets.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Junior Translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of financial terminology. It correctly uses \"RMB86 billion\" for the daily average, and accurately reflects the increase in liquidity providers and funding quotas. However, it uses \"RMB18 billion\" for the total quota, which may not align with the dictionary's \"RMB18 billion\" for \"180\" if the context implies \"RMB180 billion.\"\n2. **Second Junior Translator**: This translation is also fluent but has some inconsistencies. It uses \"RMB18 billion\" for the daily average, which is incorrect (should be \"RMB86 billion\"). It also uses \"RMB14 billion\" for the original quota, which may not match the dictionary's \"RMB140 billion\" for \"140.\"\n3. **Third Junior Translator**: This translation has a significant error in stating \"RMB860 billion\" instead of \"RMB86 billion\" for the daily average. It also uses \"RMB140 billion\" and \"RMB180 billion\" for the funding quotas, which aligns with the dictionary but may be inconsistent with the original text's \"140 billion\" and \"180 billion.\"\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"RMB860 billion\" for the daily average, which is incorrect. It also uses \"RMB140 billion\" and \"RMB180 billion\" for the funding quotas, which may not match the original text's \"140 billion\" and \"180 billion.\"\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"RMB86 billion\" for the daily average and \"RMB140 billion\" and \"RMB180 billion\" for the funding quotas. It also correctly uses \"RMB18 billion\" for the total quota, which may be a misinterpretation of the original text.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"RMB86 billion\" for the daily average and \"RMB14 billion\" and \"RMB18 billion\" for the funding quotas, which may not align with the dictionary's \"RMB140 billion\" and \"RMB180 billion.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"RMB86 billion\" for the daily average, \"RMB140 billion\" and \"RMB180 billion\" for the funding quotas, and ensure that all terms in the dictionary are correctly translated. Based on this, the fifth junior translator's translation is the most accurate and fluent, with only minor adjustments needed for consistency with the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nLast year, the offshore RMB market was in an adjustment period. Affected by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the scale of the global offshore RMB funding pool generally contracted. Despite this, Hong Kong still maintained leadership in offshore RMB business, retaining the largest RMB funding pool globally. The RMB settled through Hong Kong remained at a daily average of about RMB86 billion, a high level. To further optimize the liquidity arrangements in the offshore RMB market, in October last year, we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from 7 to 9, and raised the total amount of bilateral liquidity support from RMB140 billion to RMB180 billion, ensuring that the market could continue to operate smoothly even in the event of liquidity shortages in the offshore RMB market. In December last year, the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" was launched, providing further impetus to Hong Kong's RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also currently studying the \"Bond Connect\" scheme with relevant mainland authorities to further facilitate participation by investors from both regions in the bond market, and to optimize the linkages of the bond market's infrastructure.\n\nDespite the global investment environment being full of various unstable factors last year, the Exchange Fund achieved an investment income of HK$68.1 billion last year, thanks to multiple defensive measures taken over a period of time. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund's compound annual investment return rate has reached 4.8%, higher than the 2.1% local inflation rate during the same period.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"diversification of investments\" and \"capital preservation first, long-term growth.\" However, it uses \"solid performance\" which is slightly less precise than \"strong performance\" or \"consistent performance.\"\n2. **Translation 2** is very close to the best version, with minor issues such as \"inflation-hedging\" instead of \"inflation-protected\" (though both are acceptable). It also uses \"prioritizing capital preservation and pursuing long-term appreciation,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n3. **Translation 3** is well-written and accurate, with the phrase \"consistently delivered strong performance\" being a strong choice. It uses \"reserve funds\" instead of \"contingency funds,\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise in the context of investment funds.\n4. **Translation 4** has a minor error in the use of \"trillion HKD\" instead of \"billion HKD,\" which is a significant numerical mistake. It also uses \"prioritizing capital preservation and long-term appreciation,\" which is slightly less formal than other versions.\n5. **Translation 5** has several grammatical issues, including \"diversification investment\" (should be \"diversified investment\") and \"extracted for investment\" (should be \"drawn down for investment\"). It also uses \"long-term stability investment return,\" which is awkwardly phrased.\n6. **Translation 6** is very strong, with accurate use of terms and a natural flow. It uses \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth,\" which is a slightly more precise version of the investment strategy.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the precise numerical values and avoid awkward phrasing. Based on the above review, the best version would combine the strengths of translations 3 and 6, using \"consistently delivered strong performance\" and \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth\" while ensuring numerical accuracy and natural phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing allocations to credit assets, inflation-protected investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investments, the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" invests in alternative assets through private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annualised internal rate of return of about 12% since its establishment. With the government's \"Future Fund\" partially allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the asset size of the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" amounted to approximately HK$181.8 billion, with a total amount of approximately HK$133.8 billion approved but not yet drawn down for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth,\" seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency funds.\n"}

subdued, Hong Kong's economic growth has softened. This year, the local stock market and residential property market have experienced volatility, and housing affordability remains stretched.\n\nDespite global market risks and shocks, Hong Kong's banking system remains sound. Banks' capital and liquidity conditions remain good; asset quality shows slight signs of deterioration, but remains at healthy levels.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite facing a volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable, reflecting the resilience of the linked exchange rate system to external shocks.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance fluency, grammatical correctness, and precision in vocabulary selection.\n1. **\"Despite faced with\"** – This is grammatically incorrect. The correct structure should be \"Despite facing\" or \"Faced with.\" All translations except the first and second use \"facing,\" which is correct.\n2. **\"Turbulent\" vs. \"volatile\"** – While both are acceptable, \"volatile\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to describe exchange rates, making it a more appropriate choice.\n3. **\"Resilience of the linked exchange rate system to external shocks\"** – This is accurate and well-structured. However, \"resilience\" is a strong term that effectively conveys the system's ability to withstand external pressures.\n4. **\"To withstand external shocks\"** – This phrase is slightly redundant when paired with \"resilience,\" as resilience inherently implies the ability to withstand shocks. However, it is not incorrect and may be used for emphasis.\n5. **\"The linked exchange rate system\"** – This is a direct and accurate translation of \"聯繫匯率制度.\" It is clear and maintains the technical accuracy of the original term.\n6. **\"External shocks\"** – This is a correct and commonly used term in economic contexts to describe unexpected events that impact financial systems.\nConsidering these observations, the best translation would use \"volatile\" to describe the external environment, \"resilience\" to describe the system's ability to withstand shocks, and maintain a grammatically correct structure. The fourth, sixth, and third translations are the closest to this ideal, with the fourth and sixth being the most fluent and grammatically correct. The third translation uses \"ability\" instead of \"resilience,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation is:\n**Despite facing a volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable, reflecting the resilience of the linked exchange rate system to external shocks.**\n\nThe original text discusses the smooth operation of the money market and the adjustment of interest rates in Hong Kong following a decision by the US Federal Reserve. The translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate but has grammatical errors, such as \"adjusted upwards the Federal Funds Rate\" (should be \"adjusted upwards the Federal Funds Rate target range\"). Also, \"1.00\" should be \"1.00 percent\" for clarity.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"money market\" and \"increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent.\" However, \"with ample liquidity among banks\" is slightly less precise than \"interbank liquidity.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Similar to the second, but uses \"monetary market\" instead of \"money market.\" The phrase \"adjust the Federal Funds Rate target range upwards\" is slightly awkward compared to \"raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This is a strong translation, using \"money markets\" and \"interbank liquidity.\" It also correctly uses \"raise the Federal Funds Rate target range\" and \"increased by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\" It is concise and accurate.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Contains the error \"interbank liquidity fund is ample,\" which is not grammatically correct. Also, \"adjusted upwards 25 basis points\" should be \"adjusted upwards by 25 basis points.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"monetary markets,\" \"ample liquidity in the interbank market,\" and \"adjusted upwards the target range for the federal funds rate.\" It also correctly uses \"increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"money markets\" or \"monetary markets\" based on context, include \"interbank liquidity\" for precision, and use \"raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate\" for clarity. It should also use \"increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent\" for accuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nMoney markets continue to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. In December, following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, Hong Kong's basic interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent.\n\n# Banking System Stability\nThe original text is a short title: \"# 銀行體系穩定\". The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for each term, and the junior translators have produced variations of the same core phrase.\nStrengths of the translations include accurate use of the dictionary terms, particularly \"banking system\" for \"銀行體系\" and \"stability\" for \"穩定\". All translations correctly reflect the core meaning of the original text.\nWeaknesses include inconsistent capitalization and formatting. For example, translations 2 and 4 use \"Banking System Stability\" with capital letters, which is appropriate for a title, while translations 1, 3, and 6 use lowercase, which is less suitable for a title. Translation 5 uses \"banking stability\" without the \"system\" component, which omits a key part of the original meaning.\nThe best translation should be a title that accurately reflects the original meaning, uses appropriate capitalization, and includes all key terms. \"Banking System Stability\" is the most appropriate choice as it includes all key terms, uses proper capitalization for a title, and is consistent with the dictionary options provided.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is strengthening the risk governance framework of banks, as well as the management of credit, liquidity, and technology risks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also taking specific actions to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties companies face in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary, the sixth junior translator's version is the most accurate and natural. It correctly uses \"regulatory policy\" (matching the dictionary's \"policy\" and \"regulatory\"), \"preparations for implementing\" (using \"implementation\" from the dictionary), and \"Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance\" (using \"Ordinance\" and \"Resolution Mechanism\" from the dictionary). The sentence structure is fluent and grammatically sound, and it maintains the formal tone appropriate for policy-related texts.\nThe first and second translations use \"supervisory policies\" and \"supervisory\" instead of \"regulatory,\" which is less precise in this context. \"Supervisory\" is more about oversight, while \"regulatory\" refers to rules and standards, which better matches the original text's intent.\nThe third and fourth translations use \"preparation work\" and \"preparing Hong Kong,\" which are slightly less concise than \"preparations for implementing.\" Additionally, the fourth translation uses \"preparing Hong Kong for the implementation,\" which is slightly more wordy than necessary.\nThe fifth translation is very close to the sixth, but it uses \"in the area of regulatory policies\" instead of \"in terms of regulatory policy,\" which is slightly less direct.\nBased on this review, the best translation would retain the clarity and conciseness of the sixth junior translator's version, while ensuring that all dictionary terms are used appropriately and that the sentence flows naturally in English.\nIn terms of the dictionary terms, \"本港\" is correctly translated as \"Hong Kong's\" in the sixth translation. \"國際\" is translated as \"international,\" which is correct. \"監管\" is translated as \"regulatory,\" which is the best fit in this context. \"會計\" is translated as \"accounting,\" which is accurate. \"處置\" is translated as \"resolution,\" which is the correct term in the context of financial institutions. \"框架\" is translated as \"framework,\" which is appropriate. \"條例\" is translated as \"Ordinance,\" which is correct. \"機制\" is translated as \"Mechanism,\" which is one of the acceptable options in the dictionary.\nThe best possible translation would be:\nIn terms of regulatory policy, significant progress has been made in Hong Kong's preparations for implementing international regulatory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency and stylistic appropriateness. The first, fourth, and sixth translations use the exact same title: \"# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status.\" While this is technically correct, the use of the hashtag (#) is unnecessary in this context and may be more appropriate for social media or headings in a digital format rather than a formal translation. Additionally, \"International Financial Centre\" is capitalized inconsistently, which may be a stylistic choice but is not standard in formal English writing.\nThe second translation, \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status,\" is grammatically correct and fluent, but it lacks the nuance of the original Chinese, which emphasizes the significance or role of Hong Kong in the global financial landscape. The use of \"status\" alone may not fully capture the intended meaning of \"地位\" in this context.\nThe third translation, \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre,\" is the most fluent and natural-sounding among the options. It effectively conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text by using \"status as\" to emphasize the role or position of Hong Kong. This translation also correctly uses \"international financial centre\" as the dictionary specifies, and it maintains proper grammar and vocabulary.\nThe fifth translation, \"Hong Kong’s International financial centre status,\" has a minor issue with capitalization (\"International\" should not be capitalized unless it is the beginning of a sentence or part of a proper noun). This is a small but noticeable error that could be corrected for better readability.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be one that is both grammatically correct and stylistically appropriate, accurately reflecting the meaning of the original Chinese text. It should use \"status as\" to convey the role or position of Hong Kong, and it should use the correct capitalization and formatting for a formal English text. Additionally, it should avoid unnecessary symbols like the hashtag unless specifically required for formatting purposes.\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as the global hub for offshore renminbi business and asset management centre. The tax system has been further refined, fostering a more conducive environment to attract multinational companies to establish treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority smoothly commenced the implementation of the regulatory regime for stored value payment tools and retail payment systems, and granted 13 licences for stored value payment tools.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the difficult investment environment full of black swan events, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past few years, which enhanced the resilience of the foreign exchange fund, the foreign exchange fund recorded a 2% overall investment return.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency, structure, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of dictionary terms. However, the placement of \"thanks to\" at the end of the sentence disrupts the flow slightly.\n2. **Second junior translator**: The translation is accurate and uses the dictionary terms correctly. However, it repeats \"foreign exchange fund\" unnecessarily, which could be streamlined for better readability.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very similar to the second one and also repeats \"foreign exchange fund.\" It is grammatically correct but could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is fluent and uses the dictionary terms appropriately. It also avoids repetition by using \"Exchange Fund\" once and referring to it as \"the Fund\" later. However, \"Exchange Fund\" may not be the exact term intended by the original text, which uses \"外匯基金\" (foreign exchange fund).\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is well-structured and uses the dictionary terms correctly. It avoids repetition and maintains a natural flow. It is one of the strongest translations.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is grammatically correct but has a slightly awkward structure, particularly with the phrase \"enhanced resilience of the foreign exchange Fund\" placed in the middle of the sentence. It also lacks the clarity of the fifth translation.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and avoid unnecessary repetition. It should also use the dictionary terms accurately and maintain the natural flow of the original message. Based on the above review, the fifth junior translator's version is the strongest, but it can be slightly refined for clarity and conciseness.\nThe final translation should:\n- Use \"foreign exchange fund\" consistently.\n- Avoid repetition of \"foreign exchange fund.\"\n- Ensure that \"enhanced\" is used correctly in the context of \"resilience.\"\n- Maintain a natural and fluent structure.\nThus, the improved translation is as follows:\nDespite the difficult investment environment full of black swan events, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past few years that enhanced the resilience of the foreign exchange fund, the fund recorded a 2% overall investment return.\n\nThe Monetary Authority quickens the pace of diversification in investment, especially in long-term growth portfolios.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe original sentence emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to maintain effective communication with the community and market through various channels, including media and public education, with the goal of facilitating public understanding of its policies and operations.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"maintains effective communications\" and \"facilitate public understanding,\" which aligns well with the original. However, \"operation\" should be \"operations\" to match the plural form in the original.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"facilitating the public's understanding\" and \"policies and operations,\" which are appropriate. The use of \"various channels\" is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is nearly identical to the second, with the same strengths and minor redundancy in \"various channels.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is very strong. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently, \"facilitate the public's understanding,\" and \"policies and operations.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"various channels,\" which is slightly redundant but not incorrect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is also a strong translation. It uses \"the market\" instead of \"markets,\" which is slightly less plural but still acceptable. The structure is clear and fluent.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation has a structural issue. It begins with \"operates through media,\" which misrepresents the original meaning. The original sentence is about communication, not operation. Additionally, \"operation\" should be \"operations.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"facilitate the public's understanding.\"\n- Use \"policies and operations\" (plural).\n- Avoid redundancy in \"various channels.\"\n- Maintain the correct structure, emphasizing communication, not operation.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with the community and markets through media, public education activities, and other channels, facilitating the public's understanding of the HKMA's policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security, to help cope with the challenges brought by implementing new measures and the increasing complexity of work.\n"}

announcement regarding a regulatory change in Hong Kong's financial policy. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, structure, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary term \"Buffer\" for \"緩衝\" and \"adjusted upwards\" for \"上調.\"\n- The term \"counter-cyclical\" is used appropriately for \"逆周期.\"\n- The date \"January 1, 2017\" is consistently translated, and the percentage \"1.25%\" is preserved as is.\n- The term \"Hong Kong\" is used correctly in all translations, with some using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is the official name of the institution.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"counter-cyclical\" with a hyphen (\"counter-cyclical\"), while others omit it. The dictionary does not specify this, but \"countercyclical\" is more commonly used in financial contexts without a hyphen.\n- The phrase \"with effect from\" is used in some translations, which is appropriate, but others use \"from... onwards,\" which is less formal and slightly less precise.\n- The term \"rate\" is used in one translation (\"capital rate\") instead of \"ratio,\" which is less precise in this context. The dictionary lists \"rate\" and \"ratio\" as alternatives for \"比率,\" but \"ratio\" is more accurate for \"capital ratio.\"\n- Some translations use \"announces\" in the present tense, while others use \"announced\" in the past tense. The original sentence uses \"公布,\" which is in the past tense, so \"announced\" is more appropriate.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"countercyclical\" without a hyphen for consistency with financial terminology.\n- Use \"with effect from\" for clarity and formality.\n- Use \"ratio\" instead of \"rate\" for \"比率\" in this context.\n- Use \"announced\" in the past tense to match the original verb \"公布.\"\n- Ensure that \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is used consistently as the full name of the institution.\n**Best Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that, with effect from January 1, 2017, the countercyclical buffer capital ratio applicable to Hong Kong will be adjusted upwards to 1.25%.\n\n# February\n\n# 5 February\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) publishing a consultation summary on proposals to introduce mandatory clearing and expand mandatory reporting under the regulatory regime for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"published conclusions to the proposals\" which is awkward and not idiomatic. \"Published a consultation summary\" would be more natural. Also, \"introducing mandatory clearing and expanding mandatory reporting\" is correct but could be more concise.\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"publish\" in present tense, which is incorrect since the action has already been completed. Also, \"mandatory clearing and settlement regime\" is not directly supported by the original text, which refers to \"mandatory clearing and expanding mandatory reporting.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"published a consultation summary\" which is accurate. However, \"expanded mandatory reporting\" is slightly off; the original says \"expand mandatory reporting,\" which is better phrased as \"expanding mandatory reporting.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"jointly publish a consultation paper summarizing proposals\" which is accurate. However, \"supervisory regulatory regime\" is not directly supported by the original text, which uses \"regulatory regime\" without the \"supervisory\" modifier.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"have published a summary of their consultation\" which is accurate. \"Under the regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives\" is correct and natural.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"have published a consultation summary\" which is accurate. \"Under the regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives\" is correct and natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use past perfect tense (\"have published\") to indicate the action has been completed. It should use \"consultation summary\" as this is the most accurate term for \"諮詢總結.\" The phrase \"introduce mandatory clearing and expand mandatory reporting\" is concise and accurate. The term \"regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives\" is the most natural and precise rendering of the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) have published a consultation summary on proposals to introduce mandatory clearing and expand mandatory reporting under the regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n# March\n\n#March 21\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\n# May\n\n# 16 May\n\nThe original text is:  \n**金管局公布硬幣收集計劃延長服務多兩年至2018年9月止。**\nThe dictionary provides specific translations for key terms, and the junior translators have mostly adhered to these, with some minor variations in style and formality.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announces the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA), which is appropriate for formal contexts. Correctly uses \"extension of the Coin Collection programme\" as per the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy, but grammatically correct and fluent.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA announces the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the abbreviation \"HKMA,\" which is common in news and official contexts. Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly less formal than the first translation, but still appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announces the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first translation, which is accurate and well-structured.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority announces the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA,\" which may be too vague or incorrect in context.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The HKMA announced the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of dictionary terms and abbreviation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses the past tense \"announced\" instead of \"announces,\" which may be less appropriate if the announcement is recent or ongoing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   *\"The Monetary Authority announces the programme for Coin collection extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\"*  \n   - **Strengths:** None.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Repetitive and grammatically awkward. The phrase \"programme for Coin collection extension of the Coin Collection programme\" is redundant and unclear.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct abbreviation \"HKMA\" for brevity and clarity.\n- Use the present tense \"announces\" to reflect a current or recent announcement.\n- Maintain clarity and conciseness without redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA announces the extension of the Coin Collection programme for another two years until September 2018.\n\n# May 18\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the launch of the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative\" at the Cyber Security Summit 2016, further enhancing the resilience of Hong Kong's banking sector against cyber attacks.\n\n# June\n\n# 1–2 June\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking and Supervision Committee jointly organise a senior seminar for independent non-executive directors of Hong Kong banks.\n\n# 3 June\n\nThe 2016 Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance was gazetted, allowing companies to deduct interest expenses on internal group financing activities under specified conditions, and providing tax incentives for Hong Kong's corporate treasury centres.\n\n# June 10th\n\nThe original text discusses the gazetting of the 2016 Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance, which introduces a new structure for open-ended fund companies, thereby diversifying Hong Kong’s fund registration platform. The junior translators have produced translations that are largely accurate but vary in fluency, grammar, and the use of dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"published\" instead of \"gazetted,\" which is less precise in legal contexts. Also, \"more diversified\" is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"diversifying.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted,\" which is appropriate. \"Further diversifying\" is a strong and natural choice. The structure is concise and fluent.\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"enhancing the diversification,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary and less direct than \"diversifying.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Similar to the third, but \"enhancing the diversification\" is repeated, which is not ideal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"published in the Gazette,\" which is accurate but slightly wordy. \"Making Hong Kong's fund registration platform more diversified\" is correct but less concise than \"diversifying.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"gazetted\" and \"making Hong Kong's fund registration platform more diversified,\" which is accurate and concise. However, the use of \"and\" before \"making\" is slightly awkward.\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should use \"gazetted\" as it is the most precise legal term for the act of publishing legislation. \"Diversifying\" is more concise and natural than \"making... more diversified.\" The structure should be clear and direct, avoiding unnecessary words. The term \"open-ended fund company structure\" is more precise than \"structure for open-ended fund companies.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe 2016 Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance was gazetted, introducing a new open-ended fund company structure, diversifying Hong Kong’s fund registration platform.\n\n# June 20\n\nThe original sentence is: \"在政府債券計劃下發行第六批零售通脹掛鈎債券(iBond)。\"\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Issue the sixth retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the government bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"inflation-linked bonds\" and \"under the government bond programme.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Issue\" is a verb, but the original sentence is in passive voice. Also, \"sixth\" should be \"sixth batch\" to match \"第六批.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"Under the Government bond programme, the issuance of the sixth batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond).\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"issuance\" and \"sixth batch.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The sentence is incomplete; it ends with \"issuance\" without a verb or completion.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Issuance of the sixth batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the government bond programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct structure and use of \"sixth batch.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"government bond programme\" should be \"Government bond programme\" with a capital \"G\" as per the dictionary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Under the Government bond programme, the sixth retail inflation-linked bond (iBond) is issued.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct capitalization and use of \"is issued.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"bond\" should be plural \"bonds\" to match \"第六批.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Under the Government bond programme, the sixth retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) are being issued.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct capitalization, plural \"bonds,\" and use of present continuous tense.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"are being issued\" is slightly more complex than necessary; \"issuance\" might be more concise.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Issuance of the sixth batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBonds) under the Government Bonds Programme.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"sixth batch\" and \"iBonds.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Government Bonds Programme\" should be \"Government bond programme\" (lowercase \"b\") as per the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"issuance\" as the main verb to match the passive tone of the original.\n- Use \"sixth batch\" to match \"第六批.\"\n- Capitalize \"Government\" and use lowercase \"bond programme\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"iBond\" as per the dictionary (not \"iBonds\").\n- Ensure the sentence is complete and grammatically correct.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIssuance of the sixth batch of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) under the Government bond programme.\n\n# June 30\n\nThe original text is a formal legal statement announcing the gazetting of an ordinance that establishes a cross-sector financial institution resolution mechanism in Hong Kong. The translations provided by junior translators are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, formality, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is fluent and accurate, using \"published\" for \"刊憲\" (gazetted), which is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"gazetted.\" The term \"resolution mechanism\" is correctly used, and \"cross-sector\" is appropriately translated. However, \"The Ordinance on the Mechanism for the Resolution of Cross-Sector Financial Institutions\" is a bit wordy and not the exact title.\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"proclaimed\" for \"刊憲,\" which is a more formal and precise term in legal contexts. The title \"Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance\" is correct and matches the dictionary. However, \"providing\" is used in the present tense, which may not align with the past action of gazetting.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"gazetted\" for \"刊憲,\" which is appropriate. The term \"System\" is used for \"機制,\" which is acceptable but less precise than \"mechanism\" or \"regime.\" The title is correct, and the sentence structure is fluent.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is accurate but includes \"in the Gazette,\" which is redundant since \"gazetted\" already implies publication in the Gazette. The title is slightly off, using \"Mechanism for the Resolution of Financial Institutions\" instead of the exact title.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is concise and accurate. It uses \"gazetted\" and \"providing\" in the correct form. The title is correct, and the sentence structure is natural. However, \"to provide\" is in the infinitive form, which may not be the best fit for the context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"gazetted\" for \"刊憲,\" which is appropriate. The title is correct, and the sentence structure is natural. The use of \"providing\" in the present participle form is suitable for the context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"gazetted\" for \"刊憲\" to reflect the formal legal process. The title should be \"Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance\" as per the dictionary. The verb \"providing\" should be in the present participle form to match the structure of the sentence. The term \"mechanism\" is more appropriate than \"System\" for \"機制.\" The sentence should be concise and formal, reflecting the legal nature of the text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe \"Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance\" has been gazetted, providing a legal basis for establishing a cross-sector financial institutions resolution mechanism in Hong Kong.\n\n# July\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority separately signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Centre through the IFFO platform to promote investment and financing for infrastructure projects in Asia.\n\nThe original sentence is concise and informative, conveying that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established an office to promote Hong Kong's development as a hub for infrastructure financing. The junior translators have mostly captured the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in phrasing and grammatical structure that affect fluency and precision.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as the subject and the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) as the newly established entity.\n- The use of \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office\" is consistent across most translations, aligning with the dictionary entry for \"融資促\" and \"進辦.\"\n- The phrase \"promote Hong Kong's development as an infrastructure financing hub\" is effectively used in several translations, accurately reflecting the original intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first, second, and third translations use \"development into\" or \"development of,\" which are slightly less idiomatic than \"development as\" in this context.\n- The fourth translation uses the present tense \"establishes\" instead of the past tense \"established,\" which is less appropriate for a completed action.\n- The sixth translation omits \"Infrastructure\" from the office name, which is a critical detail and should be included as per the dictionary.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the past tense \"established\" to reflect the completed action of founding the office.\n- Use \"development as\" to convey the intended transformation of Hong Kong.\n- Ensure the full name of the office includes \"Infrastructure\" to match the dictionary and maintain clarity.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to promote Hong Kong's development as an infrastructure financing hub.\n\n# July 5\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Boao Forum for Asia jointly organise a financial cooperation conference in Hong Kong, themed “Finance Promotes the Real Economy”.\n\n# July 20\n\nThe original sentence, \"廣東省（包括深圳）與香港之間的電子支票聯合結算啟動。\" translates to a formal announcement about the initiation of a joint electronic cheque settlement system between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, and the junior translators have used these to varying degrees of success.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The joint electronic cheque clearing between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been launched.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"joint,\" \"electronic,\" \"cheque,\" \"clearing,\" and \"launched.\" The structure is fluent and natural.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Clearing\" is a valid translation for \"結算,\" but \"settlement\" might be more precise in this context, as it refers to the finalization of financial transactions.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The electronic cheque joint settlement between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been launched.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"settlement\" for \"結算,\" which is more accurate in a financial context. The structure is natural.\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Joint\" is placed after \"cheque,\" which is slightly awkward but still understandable.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The electronic cheque joint clearing between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong was launched.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Similar to the first translation, with a slightly more formal tone due to the use of \"was launched.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** Same issue with \"clearing\" instead of \"settlement.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) with Hong Kong’s e-cheque Joint clearing is triggered.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"e-cheque\" and \"triggered\" from the dictionary.\n   - **Weaknesses:** Awkward structure, incorrect placement of \"Joint\" (capitalized unnecessarily), and \"is triggered\" is less natural than \"has been launched.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The electronic cheque joint settlement between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been initiated.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"settlement\" and \"initiated,\" which is a valid synonym for \"啟動.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Initiated\" is slightly less common than \"launched\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The e-cheque joint settlement between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been launched.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"e-cheque\" and \"settlement,\" with a natural structure and \"launched.\"\n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant; this is a strong translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"settlement\" for \"結算\" (more precise in financial contexts), \"e-cheque\" for \"電子支票\" (more modern and commonly used), and \"launched\" for \"啟動\" (more natural in this context). The structure should be clear and formal, as the sentence is likely from an official announcement.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe e-cheque joint settlement between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been launched.\n\n# August\n\n# August 12\n\nThe original sentence, \"在政府債券計劃下發行首批銀色債券。\" translates to \"Issue the first batch of Silver bonds under the government bond programme.\" The junior translators have provided several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nTranslation 1: \"Under the Government bond programme, the first Silver bonds were issued.\" This translation is grammatically correct and fluent. It uses \"were issued\" to indicate a completed action, which is appropriate if the issuance has already occurred. However, the use of \"Government\" with a capital \"G\" may be unnecessary unless referring to a specific government entity.\nTranslation 2: \"Issue the first batch of Silver bonds under the government bond programme.\" This is a direct translation that uses the imperative form \"Issue,\" which may be more suitable for instructions or announcements rather than a factual statement. It lacks a subject and verb tense, making it less suitable for a declarative sentence.\nTranslation 3: \"Under the Government bond programme, the first batch of Silver bonds will be issued.\" This translation uses the future tense \"will be issued,\" which may not be accurate if the issuance has already taken place. It is grammatically correct but may misrepresent the timing of the event.\nTranslation 4: \"Issue the first batch of Silver bonds under the government bond programme.\" This is identical to Translation 2 and suffers from the same issues regarding the use of the imperative form.\nTranslation 5: \"The issuance of the first silver bonds under the government bond programme.\" This is a noun phrase rather than a full sentence. It lacks a verb and is more suitable as a title or subtitle than as a standalone statement.\nTranslation 6: \"Under the government bond programme, the first batch of Silver bonds was issued.\" This translation is grammatically correct and uses the past tense \"was issued,\" which is appropriate if the issuance has already occurred. It also uses \"government\" with a lowercase \"g,\" which is more standard unless referring to a specific government.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use a declarative sentence with the past tense to indicate that the issuance has already occurred. It is also important to use \"government\" with a lowercase \"g\" unless referring to a specific entity. Additionally, \"first batch\" is more natural than \"first\" alone in this context.\nImproved Translation:\nUnder the government bond programme, the first batch of Silver bonds was issued.\n\n# August 25\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission (FSMC) is not the correct entity in this context; the correct authority is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This is a critical error in Translation 1. Translation 2 correctly uses \"HKMA\" but incorrectly uses \"tool\" instead of \"facilities\" for \"儲值支付工具,\" which should be \"stored value payment facilities\" or \"stored value payment instruments.\" Translation 3 is accurate in most respects but omits \"batch\" and uses \"tools\" instead of \"facilities.\" Translation 4 is very close but uses \"facility\" instead of \"facilities\" in \"stored value facility licences,\" which is slightly off. Translation 5 is accurate but uses \"tools\" instead of \"facilities\" in \"stored value payment tools.\" Translation 6 incorrectly refers to \"Payment Tools Ordinance\" instead of \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\"\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA,\" \"stored value payment facilities,\" and \"licences\" for \"牌照.\" It should also use \"granted\" for \"批出\" and \"issuers\" for \"行人.\" The phrase \"first batch\" should be retained to reflect \"首.\"\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that it has granted the first batch of stored value payment facilities licences to five issuers of stored value payment facilities under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the Payment Ordinance).\n\n# September\n\n# September 6\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Treasury Markets Association co-hosted the \"2016 Treasury Markets Summit\" in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing banks to conduct pilot trials before fully introducing fintech and other technology initiatives.\n\n# September 28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted a seminar in Frankfurt, Germany, to promote Hong Kong's role in China's opportunities.\n\n# October\n\n# 10月24日至25日\nThe original text is a date range: \"10月24日至25日\" which translates to \"October 24 to 25.\"\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"24 to 25 October\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the date format and the term \"October\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The order of the date is reversed compared to standard English conventions (day before month).  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** \"月\" is translated as \"October,\" which is correct. \"日至\" is translated as \"to,\" which is correct. \"24\" and \"25\" are correctly used as numbers.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# October 24 to 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the date format and includes the hash symbol as in the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hash symbol is not typically used in English date formats, though it may be stylistic.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# October 24 to 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Same as the second translation.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"October 24th to 25th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct order (month before day) and includes ordinal suffixes.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of \"24th\" and \"25th\" is more formal than necessary for a simple date range.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"October 24 to 25\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the standard English date format (month before day).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"24–25 October\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct order (day before month) and an en dash for the range.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The order is reversed compared to standard English conventions.  \n   - **Dictionary Check:** All terms are correctly translated.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe most natural and standard English date format is **\"October 24 to 25\"**, which follows the convention of placing the month before the day and using \"to\" for the range. This format is widely used in English and is clear and concise. It also aligns with the dictionary entries provided, using \"October\" for \"月\" and \"to\" for \"日至.\"\n### Final Translation:\nOctober 24 to 25\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of England, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) jointly organise a high-level seminar in Hong Kong titled \"Interactions between Monetary, Financial, and Prudential Regulatory Policies after the Financial Crisis.\"\n\n# 10月26日至28日\nThe original text is a date range: \"10月26日至28日\" which translates to \"October 26th to 28th\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating the components of the date, including \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), but in this context, the most appropriate translations are \"October\" for \"10月\" and \"26th to 28th\" for \"26日至28日.\"\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"October 26th to 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurate and natural-sounding.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None. This is a strong translation.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# October 26 to 28\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of the hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary and may be confusing in this context.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"# October 26th to 28th\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the first translation, but with a hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The hashtag is not needed and may be misleading.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"26–28 October\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses a common European date format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The format is less common in American English and may be less intuitive for some readers.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"26 October to 28 October\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Fully explicit and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly wordy compared to other options.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"October 26 to 28\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Simple and clear.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omitting the \"th\" in \"26th\" and \"28th\" may be less formal, but is still acceptable in many contexts.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**  \nThe most natural and widely accepted format in English is \"October 26th to 28th.\" It is concise, clear, and uses the ordinal form (\"26th\" and \"28th\") which is standard in English for dates. The hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary and should be omitted. The format \"26–28 October\" is also correct but may be less familiar to some English speakers, especially in American English. The fully explicit format \"26 October to 28 October\" is correct but more verbose than needed.\n**Improved translation:**  \nOctober 26th to 28th\n\nIFFO hosted its first executive workshop titled \"Private Participation in Investment and Financing of Emerging Market Infrastructure Projects\" and announced that 13 more institutions have joined as IFFO partners, bringing the total number to over 50.\n\n# 27 October\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded its Renminbi Primary Liquidity Provider (PLP) Programme, increasing the number of participating banks from seven to nine and raising the total amount of the programme to RMB18 billion. The transparency of the usage of the Renminbi liquidity funding arrangements has also increased.\n\n# November\n\n# November 4\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that it has granted the second batch of stored value payment facility licences under the Payment Ordinance, bringing the total number of stored value payment facility licensees to 13.\n\n# November 8\n\nIFFO hosted a high-level seminar, during which Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, talked about AIIB's operations and infrastructure projects.\n\n# November 11\nThe original text is a simple date: \"11月11日,\" which translates to \"November 11.\" The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month) and \"日\" (day), but in this context, the most appropriate translations are \"November\" for \"月\" and \"11\" for \"日.\" The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, though there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, third, fifth, and sixth translations all correctly use \"November 11\" without any unnecessary punctuation or formatting. The second translation uses \"November 11th,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than necessary for a simple date. The fourth translation uses \"11 November,\" which is also correct but less common in American English.\nThe best translation would be \"November 11,\" as it is concise, clear, and follows standard date formatting in English.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) organises \"FinTech Day\" and releases a white paper on research into distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to establish the \"Fintech Innovation Centre\" to help generate innovative ideas and pilot new fintech technologies.\n\n# November 22\nThe original text is a simple date format: \"11月22日\", which translates to \"November 22\" in English. The dictionary provides several options for translating \"月\" (month), \"2\" (two), and \"日\" (day), but in this context, the most appropriate translations are \"November\" for \"11月\" and \"22\" for \"22日\". The translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in formatting and punctuation.\nThe first, third, and fourth translations use \"November 22nd\", which is grammatically correct but slightly more formal than necessary for a simple date. The second and sixth translations use \"November 22\", which is more concise and commonly used in many contexts. The fifth translation uses \"# 22 November\", which is less common in English date formatting and may be confusing to some readers.\nConsidering these observations, the most natural and commonly used format in English is \"November 22\". This format is concise, clear, and widely understood. It avoids unnecessary punctuation and adheres to standard English date conventions. Therefore, \"November 22\" is the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text.\n\nThe original text is a formal announcement regarding a consultation paper on financial regulations. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau\" which is not in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"Resolution Regime\" but \"Regime\" may not be the best fit for \"條例\" (ordinance). The structure is clear and fluent.\n2. **Second Translation:** Uses \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" which is not in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"SFC\" and \"Insurance Authority\" and \"Resolution Mechanism\" for \"處置機制.\" However, \"Financial Services\" may not be the best match for \"財經事務及.\"\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" again, not in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Resolution Mechanism\" and \"consultation paper.\" The structure is concise and fluent.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Uses \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" which is not in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Resolution Mechanism\" and \"consultation paper.\" The structure is clear but slightly awkward with \"the Treasury Bureau.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" again, not in the dictionary. It correctly uses \"Resolution Mechanism\" and \"consultation paper.\" The verb \"has published\" is slightly less formal than \"published.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Uses \"Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\" again, not in the dictionary. It uses \"resolution\" without capitalization, which is less formal. \"Insurance authority\" should be \"Insurance Authority\" for consistency.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the exact terms from the dictionary.\n- Maintain formal tone and clarity.\n- Ensure correct use of \"Resolution Mechanism\" for \"處置機制.\"\n- Use \"consultation paper\" for \"文件.\"\n- Use \"proposed regulation on protected arrangements under\" for \"下有.\"\n- Ensure correct capitalization and consistency in titles.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau, together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and the Insurance Authority, jointly published a consultation paper on the proposed regulation on protected arrangements under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to help more Chinese enterprises establish treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising in","leveraging

growth softened in 2016. Faced with intensified uncertainties in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real local GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with subdued inbound tourism putting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Local demand momentum also slowed, but continued to provide main support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate maintained at a low of 3.3 to 3.4%. Due to eased local costs and external price pressures, consumer price inflation further slowed. Faced with a volatile external environment and changing market sentiments, asset markets experienced fluctuations. In view of the residential property market rebounding again, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite the volatility in the external environment and the rise in US interest rates, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and monetary markets have continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate, which slightly weakened in January, has remained around the 7.75 level. The exchange guarantee was not triggered during the year, and the total outstanding balance of the Exchange Fund bills and notes has remained almost unchanged, at approximately HK$1.2 trillion. Following the US interest rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's basic interest rate was adjusted upwards from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank interest rates (HIBOR) and yields on longer-term bonds remained at relatively low levels, but slightly increased towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the trends in corresponding US interbank rates and yields. Overall bank loan growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although the overall quality of loans has slightly deteriorated, the ratio of specific classified loans has remained at extremely low levels.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local Gross Domestic Product  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic Gross Value Added Growth by Expenditure Items (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarter-on-quarter change in the total amount of local fixed capital formation, adjusted for seasonal factors, is not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Local Demand\n\nThe growth momentum of local demand weakened slightly in 2016. Despite stable employment and income conditions continuing to support private consumption, its growth rate still fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting intensified economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. The total amount of local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate markedly on a quarterly basis (Chart 2), with a cumulative annual contraction of 0.5%. Purchases of plant and equipment by the private sector became the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year under poor business prospects, while building and construction activities turned more positive due to an increase in housing construction projects.\n\nChart 2 Local Demand  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Demand\n\nHong Kong exports showed signs of stabilizing near the end of 2016, but the overall annual performance remained weak (Chart 3). Goods exports increased by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Hong Kong's exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, with regional trade flows becoming more stable, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales after a period of rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's exports of services contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had contracted in 2015, regained some ground in 2016, while imports of services continued to grow, partially benefiting from the desire of local residents to travel abroad. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nChart 3: Goods Exports and Exports of Services  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressure remained under control in 2016. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Chart 4). The downward adjustment in new private residential rents, introduced earlier, led to a moderation in the rental component of the composite consumer price index. Benefiting from softer global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, import price inflation was contained. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate, supported by stable growth in labor costs and a moderation in rental cost pressures, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nChart 4: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary constraints. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is clear and fluent. It uses \"rose slightly\" for \"稍升至\" and \"deteriorated\" for \"轉差,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"labor\" instead of \"labour\" inconsistently, and \"Figure 5\" is used instead of \"Chart 5,\" which may not align with the dictionary's \"圖\" (Chart).\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is accurate and adheres closely to the dictionary, using \"labour earnings in nominal terms\" for \"名義工資.\" However, it uses \"the industry related to tourism\" instead of \"tourism-related sectors,\" which is slightly less concise.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This is very close to the best version. It uses \"Chart 5\" and \"labour earnings in nominal terms\" correctly. However, it uses \"By industry analysis\" instead of \"According to industry analysis,\" which is slightly less formal.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate. It uses \"sectors\" consistently and \"Chart 5\" as required. However, it uses \"rose 3.8%\" without \"by,\" which is slightly less formal than \"increased by.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"Chart 5,\" \"labour earnings in nominal terms,\" and \"rose by\" consistently. It also uses \"according to industry analysis\" and \"seasonally adjusted unemployment rate\" correctly.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version has some issues. It uses \"the increase in labour supply and demand at a similar pace\" instead of \"similar increases,\" which is less direct. It also uses \"banking stability\" for \"穩定,\" which is incorrect and not in context. Additionally, it uses \"Rate\" with a capital \"R,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\nThe best version should use \"Chart 5\" as per the dictionary, \"labour earnings in nominal terms\" for \"名義工資,\" and \"rose by\" for \"升至.\" It should also use \"tourism-related sectors\" and \"according to industry analysis.\" The fifth junior translator's version is the closest, but minor adjustments can improve fluency and consistency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe labour market remained largely stable in 2016, with similar increases in labour supply and demand. According to industry analysis, the labour market conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while other sectors remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Chart 5). Under a stable labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 1.5% in 2015.\n\nFigure 5 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are largely accurate and consistent with the dictionary guidelines. However, there are minor differences in capitalization, punctuation, and formatting that can be refined for optimal fluency and consistency.\nStrengths of the translations include:\n- Correct use of the term \"Census and Statistics Department\" for \"統計處.\"\n- Proper translation of \"勞工市場狀況\" as \"Labour Market Conditions.\"\n- Accurate use of \"Source\" for \"來源.\"\nWeaknesses and areas for improvement:\n- Inconsistencies in capitalization of \"Labour\" (e.g., \"labour\" in the fifth translation).\n- Punctuation differences, such as the use of a period after \"Conditions\" in the fifth and sixth translations.\n- The sixth translation combines the two lines into one, which may be less readable in formal contexts.\nTo produce the best possible translation, the following improvements can be made:\n- Ensure consistent capitalization of \"Labour\" as a noun.\n- Maintain a clear line break between the title and the source citation for readability.\n- Use a period after \"Conditions\" to complete the sentence.\nBased on these considerations, the most refined and professional translation would be:\nFigure 5 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all capture the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify key terms such as \"Hang Seng Index,\" \"Brexit,\" \"Federal Reserve,\" and \"renminbi.\"\n- Most translations use appropriate financial terminology, such as \"market volatility,\" \"monetary easing policies,\" and \"average daily turnover.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use inconsistent or less precise terms. For example, \"significant fluctuations\" is repeated, but \"markedly fluctuated\" or \"experienced marked fluctuations\" might be more natural.\n- The term \"pressure\" is used in different contexts, but the dictionary provides alternatives like \"depreciation pressure\" and \"pressure from the depreciation of the renminbi,\" which should be used consistently.\n- The term \"year-high\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary includes \"year-high\" as an option, so it should be used where appropriate.\n- Some translations use \"UK\" while others use \"United Kingdom\" or \"Bank of England\" for \"英國,\" but the dictionary allows for \"UK\" or \"United Kingdom,\" so consistency is needed.\n- The term \"total amount raised\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary includes \"total amount\" and \"aggregate,\" which should be used consistently.\n- The term \"capital raised\" is used in one translation, but the dictionary includes \"total amount raised\" and \"aggregate,\" which should be used consistently.\n- The term \"daily turnover\" is used in some translations, but the dictionary includes \"average daily turnover\" and \"daily trading volume,\" which should be used consistently.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use the most natural and fluent English expressions while adhering to the dictionary terms.\n- Ensure consistency in the use of terms such as \"pressure,\" \"year-high,\" \"total amount,\" and \"daily turnover.\"\n- Use \"UK\" for \"英國\" as it is the most concise and commonly used term.\n- Use \"Hang Seng Index\" consistently.\n- Ensure that the financial terms are used accurately and in context.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced marked fluctuations in 2016. Affected by the depreciation pressure on the renminbi and the volatility in the mainland stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Chart 6). In March, the Hong Kong stock market rebounded, following solid gains in the US and other major markets. Despite the Brexit referendum triggering market volatility, market sentiment improved rapidly under the expectation that the US Federal Reserve would moderate its pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high of 24,100 points in September. However, affected by the outcome of the US presidential election and the expectation that the US would quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, the Hong Kong stock market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a decline of 7.2% in 2015. The average daily turnover decreased from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, and the total amount raised by the Hong Kong stock market also decreased from HK$1,115.6 billion in the previous year to HK$490.1 billion.\n\nChart 6: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\nThe original text is \"# 物業市場,\" which translates to \"Property Market\" when using the dictionary's preferred term \"Property\" for \"物業\" and \"Market\" for \"市場.\" The junior translators have mostly captured this correctly, though there are some minor differences in formatting and capitalization.\nThe first junior translator used \"property markets,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly less precise than \"Property Market\" since it implies multiple markets rather than a singular, specific market. The second through sixth junior translators all used \"# Property Market,\" which is appropriate if the \"#\" symbol is intended to denote a heading or section title, as it often is in formatting contexts.\nThe best translation would be \"Property Market,\" as it is concise, accurate, and aligns with the dictionary's preferred terms. It also maintains the intended meaning and structure of the original text without unnecessary additions or alterations.\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight volatility in 2016. Property turnover recorded a historical low in the first quarter, subsequently recovering in the following months, but fell sharply again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, turnover slightly declined to 54,701 transactions in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose since the second quarter and surpassed the peak level in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Chart 6). Housing affordability remains tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, far above the long-term average. Due to banks introducing competitive mortgage schemes, mortgage rates slightly declined, but rose slightly again towards the end of the year, following the rise in Hong Kong interbank offered rates. In the commercial property market, trading volume remained generally stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices fell from their 2015 peak, the corresponding rental yield rose slightly compared to the previous year, but remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the expected moderate GDP growth, the government and private sector forecasts, and the factors influencing economic performance.\n- The use of terms like \"moderate growth,\" \"interest rates,\" and \"infrastructure projects\" is consistent across translations.\n- Most translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"steady\" for \"穩步,\" \"exports\" for \"出口,\" and \"interest rates\" for \"利率.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 2** incorrectly uses \"steadily\" for \"穩步\" in the phrase \"building and construction activity should steadily increase,\" whereas \"steadily\" is not listed in the dictionary for \"穩步.\" The correct term is \"steadily\" (from the dictionary), so this is acceptable, but the phrasing could be more natural.\n- **Translation 6** uses \"Infrastructure infrastructure\" for \"基建,\" which is a clear error and should be corrected to \"infrastructure.\"\n- **Translation 2** and **Translation 6** use \"will support consumption\" and \"will support consumption,\" which is grammatically correct but could be more precise with \"are expected to support consumption\" or \"will support consumption.\"\n- **Translation 3** and **Translation 4** use \"real gross domestic product (GDP)\" which is more precise than \"real local GDP\" or \"real local gross domestic product,\" but the original text uses \"實質本地生產總值,\" which is best translated as \"real local GDP.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"external macroeconomics\" instead of \"global macroeconomic,\" which is a misalignment with the dictionary term \"macroeconomic.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used exactly as specified, such as \"steadily\" for \"穩步\" and \"infrastructure\" for \"基建.\"\n- Use more natural phrasing, such as \"is expected to remain moderate\" instead of \"will remain moderate\" for consistency with the dictionary term \"expected.\"\n- Avoid redundancy, such as \"Infrastructure infrastructure\" in Translation 6.\n- Ensure that terms like \"global macroeconomic and financial environment\" are used consistently with the dictionary.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nIt is expected that real local GDP growth in 2017 will remain moderate. The government forecasts economic growth to range between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average growth rate of 2.0%. Externally, as the global macroeconomic and financial environment becomes more uncertain, global economic and trade growth is likely to remain moderate; in addition, the rise in the real effective exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, due to the strength of the US dollar, will suppress Hong Kong's export performance. Locally, although stable employment and income conditions are expected to support consumption, private consumption is anticipated to grow only moderately, weighed down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects, building and construction activities should grow steadily. However, a weak business climate and rising interest rates are likely to affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Markets\n\nIt is expected that inflationary pressures will remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and an upward trend in inflation in mainland China could lead to higher import prices. On the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may help suppress the aforementioned pressures. Under moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures can still be contained. However, due to the rise in new residential rents in early 2017, inflation in the rental component of the composite consumer price index may rise slightly. The market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the basic inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although increased uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations capture the core meaning of the original text, including the economic uncertainties, the impact of US policies, Brexit, and the housing market dynamics.\n- Most translations use appropriate terms from the dictionary, such as \"uncertainty,\" \"protectionist policies,\" \"Brexit,\" \"Hong Kong dollar,\" and \"property market.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely coherent and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Inconsistency in dictionary usage:** Some translations use dictionary terms incorrectly or inconsistently. For example, \"UK\" is used in some translations, while \"Bank of England\" is used in others, even though the original text refers to \"英國\" (UK) and not the Bank of England.\n- **Ambiguity in phrasing:** Some translations use phrases like \"the flow of Hong Kong dollar funds\" or \"the flow of funds into the Hong Kong dollar,\" which are not precise. The correct phrasing should be \"the flow of Hong Kong dollar funds.\"\n- **Redundancy and wordiness:** Some translations are unnecessarily wordy, such as \"the introduction of additional incentives by property developers\" instead of \"property developers offering additional incentives.\"\n- **Inconsistent use of terms like \"tight\":** Some translations use \"tight\" to describe the property market, which is acceptable, but others use \"stretched,\" which is also acceptable but less commonly used in economic contexts.\n- **Variation in phrasing for \"normalization of interest rates\":** Some translations use \"normalisation process,\" while others use \"normalization,\" which is acceptable but should be consistent.\n**Reasoning for improvements:**\n- **Consistency in dictionary usage:** Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used consistently and accurately. For example, \"UK\" should be used for \"英國\" and not \"Bank of England.\"\n- **Clarity and precision:** Use precise phrasing, such as \"the flow of Hong Kong dollar funds\" instead of ambiguous alternatives.\n- **Conciseness:** Avoid unnecessary wordiness and use concise phrasing where possible.\n- **Consistency in terminology:** Use consistent terms for economic concepts, such as \"tight\" or \"stretched\" for the property market, and \"normalization\" for the interest rate process.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be constrained by numerous uncertainties, with the impact from the external environment being particularly significant. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new US administration will make the global economic outlook more uncertain, and potential protectionist policies may also pose resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also lead to asset market volatility and affect the flow of Hong Kong dollar funds. In addition, the normalization of US interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains tight, and market prospects remain highly uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and property developers offering additional incentives (such as discounts and cash rebates) have released accumulated purchasing power, providing support for residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the potential acceleration of US interest rate hikes, and the steady growth in housing supply may continue to pose resistance to the property market.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite the Hong Kong economy facing headwinds, coupled with unexpected outcomes from international political events intensifying market volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained sound in 2016. The capital and liquidity positions of authorised institutions remained good, with slight deterioration in asset quality, but still remained at healthy levels.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nWith the rise in US interest rates, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) significantly increased in November and December. The composite interest rate reflecting the cost of Hong Kong dollar funding for retail banks rose slightly (Figure 7).\n\nChart 7: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), Composite Interest Rates, and Best Loan Interest Rates\n\nNote:  \n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) (monthly average) are announced by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.  \n2. The most favorable loan interest rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nRetail banking's profits slightly improved in 2016, with its Hong Kong business's overall pre-tax operating profit growing by 8.7%. The growth was mainly driven by income from foreign exchange and derivatives business (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Retail banking's post-tax profit recorded a 44.4% increase, with the growth primarily coming from non-recurring items. Retail banking's post-tax average return on assets also rose correspondingly from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8: Performance of Retail Banking\n\nThe original text discusses the net interest margin of retail banks in 2016, noting that it remained the same as in 2015, and explains the factors influencing this stability.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"net interest margin\" and \"Chart 9.\" The structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed. However, \"with lower interest rates but higher liquidity\" could be slightly more natural as \"with lower interest rates and higher liquidity.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is also accurate and fluent. It uses \"net interest rate\" instead of \"net interest margin,\" which is a minor inaccuracy. The rest of the translation is well-structured and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This is a strong translation. It uses \"net interest margin\" correctly and \"Figure 9\" is an acceptable variant of \"Chart 9.\" The sentence structure is clear and the meaning is well-preserved.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation has several issues. It uses \"net interest rate\" instead of \"net interest margin,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"invest remaining fund\" should be \"invest remaining funds,\" and \"a low rate\" is vague and less precise than \"lower interest rates.\" The phrase \"decreased interest\" is incomplete and unclear.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This is a very accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"net interest margin\" correctly and \"Chart 9\" appropriately. The sentence structure is clear and the meaning is well-conveyed.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"retail banking\" instead of \"retail banks,\" which is slightly less precise. The rest of the translation is well-structured and natural.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"net interest margin\" as the correct term, \"Chart 9\" or \"Figure 9\" as acceptable variants, and maintain a clear and natural sentence structure. It should also use \"lower interest rates and higher liquidity\" for clarity and fluency.\n**Improved Translation:**\nIn 2016, the net interest margin of retail banks was 1.32%, the same as the level in 2015 (Chart 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate their remaining funds to financial investments with lower interest rates and higher liquidity, the decline in interest income was offset by the decrease in interest costs.\n\nChart 9 Retail Banking Net Interest Margin\n\nRetail banking non-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fees and commission income fell by 11.3%, dividend income and foreign exchange and derivatives business income rose by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong money market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate a high capacity to withstand shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Target\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is mostly accurate but uses \"Monetary stability\" redundantly and incorrectly. It also uses \"currency issuance System\" with a capital \"S\" inappropriately. The term \"Reserves\" is capitalized unnecessarily, and \"Exchange Fund\" should be \"Exchange Fund\" (as per the dictionary, \"Fund\" is acceptable).\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"monetary stability\" and \"monetary base.\" However, it refers to the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Exchange Fund,\" which is not accurate. The term \"monetary base\" is correctly used.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has several grammatical errors, such as \"money stability\" instead of \"monetary stability.\" It also uses \"made corresponding increases or decreases\" incorrectly and \"fully backed with the changes\" is awkwardly phrased.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"currency issue department system,\" which is not a standard term. It also uses \"dollar reserves\" instead of \"US dollar reserves,\" which is less precise.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"currency stability\" and \"monetary issuance system\" appropriately. However, \"monetary issuance system\" is not the standard term for the system described; \"currency board system\" is more accurate.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This is the most accurate translation. It correctly uses \"currency board system\" and \"Exchange Fund.\" It also uses \"matching the changes in the monetary base by 100 percent\" effectively. However, \"100 percent\" should be \"100%.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"currency board system\" is more accurate than \"monetary issuance system\" or \"currency issuance system.\"\n- \"Exchange Fund\" should be used instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- \"Monetary base\" is the correct term, not \"monetary base\" with a capital \"M.\"\n- \"US dollar reserves\" is more precise than \"dollar reserves.\"\n- \"Fully matching the changes in the monetary base by 100%\" is more natural than \"fully backed with the changes.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the currency board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching the changes in the monetary base by 100%.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Liability certificates (fully backed by banknotes issued by three issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins  \n- The total balance of settlement accounts held by banks at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)  \n- Bills and notes of the Exchange Fund issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use the dictionary alternatives appropriately, such as \"maintain the stability\" for \"維持穩定\" and \"exchange rate\" for \"匯率.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original text.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation for \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate in financial contexts.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"convertibility\" instead of \"exchange guarantee,\" which is not accurate in this context. The term \"exchange guarantee\" is more precise and aligns with the dictionary's \"guarantee.\"\n- The phrase \"aggregate balance\" or \"total reserves\" is used in some translations, but \"aggregate surplus\" or \"total reserves\" may not be the most natural or standard term in this context.\n- Some translations use \"System\" with a capital \"S\" for \"機制,\" which is not necessary unless referring to a specific named system.\n- The use of \"led to\" in one translation is less precise than \"caused\" or \"resulting in.\"\n- Some translations repeat \"exchange rate range\" unnecessarily, which can be simplified for clarity.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"exchange guarantee\" consistently instead of \"convertibility\" or \"convertibility guarantee.\"\n- Use \"total reserves\" or \"aggregate reserves\" for \"總結餘\" as it is a standard term in financial contexts.\n- Ensure that \"機制\" is translated as \"mechanism\" or \"system\" without unnecessary capitalization.\n- Use \"caused\" or \"resulting in\" for \"令\" instead of \"led to\" for better clarity.\n- Avoid redundancy by simplifying repeated phrases like \"exchange rate range.\"\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, with only minor differences in phrasing and terminology. However, a critical review reveals several areas for improvement:\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: While all translations correctly use \"linked exchange rate system\" for \"聯繫匯率制度\", some variations exist in the use of \"Brexit\" (e.g., \"UK Brexit referendum\" vs. \"Brexit referendum\"). The dictionary lists \"Brexit\" and \"Brexit referendum\" as acceptable translations for \"脫歐公投\", so \"Brexit referendum\" is the most precise.\n2. **Fluency and Naturalness**: Some translations use phrases that are slightly awkward or overly formal, such as \"remained narrowly range-bound\" or \"fluctuated narrowly for the remainder of the year.\" A more natural phrasing would be \"remained within a narrow range\" or \"fluctuated slightly.\"\n3. **Grammar and Syntax**: Minor grammatical issues appear in some translations, such as \"has since fluctuated within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards\" (which is grammatically correct but slightly wordy). A more concise version would be \"remained within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards.\"\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations appropriately use \"Hong Kong dollar\" and \"US dollar\" as per the dictionary. However, \"the US\" is more natural than \"the United States\" in this context.\n5. **Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"exchange rate\" for \"匯率\", \"market\" for \"市場\", and \"RMB\" for \"人民幣\".\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated slightly in the first two months of 2016 and then remained within a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar significantly weakened against the US dollar in early 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Chart 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was in line with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve's December 2015 interest rate hike. In addition, other market-related factors, including the sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic outlooks for both mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the RMB exchange rate, and the general weakness of Asian currencies, all contributed to a decline in demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened in February and remained within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards, remaining unaffected by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations that the US would raise interest rates in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced a brief period of weakening pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\nFigure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\nFigure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\nChart 1 2016 Market Exchange Rate\nFigure 1 2016 markets exchange rates\nFigure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\nReview:\nThe translations provided by the junior translators mostly capture the intended meaning of the original text, but there are notable differences in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\nStrengths:\n- Most translations correctly use \"Figure\" or \"Chart\" for \"圖\" and \"Market Exchange Rates\" for \"市場匯率\".\n- The use of \"2016\" as a year is consistent across translations.\n- The structure \"Figure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\" appears in multiple translations and is the most accurate and fluent.\nWeaknesses:\n- The fourth translation uses \"Chart\" instead of \"Figure\" and \"Rate\" (singular) instead of \"Rates\" (plural), which is inconsistent with the dictionary options and the plural form implied by the context.\n- The fifth translation incorrectly uses \"markets\" (plural) instead of \"Market\" (singular), which is not appropriate in this context.\n- The second translation omits \"Market\" and uses \"in 2016\" instead of \"2016\", which changes the structure and slightly alters the meaning.\nReasoning:\nThe best translation should use \"Figure\" (as it is the most common and appropriate term for \"圖\" in this context), include \"Market\" (singular) to match the dictionary and the original text, and use \"Exchange Rates\" (plural) to reflect the correct term for \"匯率\". The year \"2016\" should be placed directly after \"Figure 1\" without the preposition \"in\".\nImproved Translation:\nFigure 1 2016 Market Exchange Rates\n\nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the aggregate outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and notes remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying around HK$122.22 billion (Chart 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued additional foreign exchange fund bills and notes with a total value of HK$13.2 billion to meet the substantial liquidity management demands of banks, causing the total surplus to correspondingly decline to HK$25.96 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund bills and notes conforms to the principles of the currency board system, as such issuance merely represents a transfer within components of the monetary base—from the total surplus to the outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and notes—while the monetary base continues to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2: Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Notes in 2016\n\n# Money Markets\nThe original text is \"# 貨幣市場\", which translates to \"# Monetary Market\" or \"# Money Market\" depending on the context. The dictionary provides several options for \"貨幣\" (monetary, money, currency) and \"市場\" (market, markets, sentiments). \nThe first junior translator used \"Monetary Markets\", which is a common term in financial contexts and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text. However, the use of \"Markets\" with a capital \"M\" may be unnecessary unless it's part of a specific title or heading.\nThe second junior translator used \"Currency Market\", which is also a valid translation. However, \"Currency\" is more specific than \"Money\" or \"Monetary\", and may not be the best fit for the general term \"貨幣\".\nThe third junior translator used \"Money Market\", which is a standard term in finance and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text. However, the use of \"Money\" may be too informal for a more technical or academic context.\nThe fourth and fifth junior translators used \"Monetary markets\", which is a valid translation. However, the use of lowercase \"markets\" may be inconsistent with the use of a hashtag in the original text.\nThe sixth junior translator used \"Currency Market\", which is a valid translation, but similar to the second junior translator's translation, \"Currency\" may be too specific for the general term \"貨幣\".\nConsidering the dictionary options and the context, \"Money Markets\" is the most appropriate translation. It is a standard term in finance, accurately reflects the meaning of the original text, and is consistent with the use of a hashtag in the original text.\n\nHong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Chart 3). During January and February, HIBORs faced some upward pressure due to increased volatility in financial markets, but stabilized in March as the financial environment returned to calm. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the Brexit referendum and reforms in the US money market funds, HIBORs remained largely stable. Partly due to year-end funding demands and HIBORs catching up with the rise in US dollar rates, HIBORs recorded a significant increase in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, short-term interbank offered rates remained below the basic interest rate level throughout 2016.\n\nIn response to the adjustment of the US Federal Funds interest rate target range from 0.25 to 0.50 percent to 0.50 to 0.75 percent on December 14 (US time), the basic interest rate was raised from 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent on December 15. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the US Federal Funds interest rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates, whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in 2016\n\nHong Kong dollar forward exchange rate premiums experienced a marked increase in January, largely following the trends of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, as well as partly reflecting investors' demand for foreign exchange hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). The forward exchange rate premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions turned more stable, Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points remained largely stable from March to November, and then rose again in December due to the narrowing of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked System) has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Market volatility intensified early in 2016, once again prompting comments about the weakening Hong Kong dollar and situations reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis period. To enhance understanding of the Linked Exchange Rate System among all sectors, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) explained the technical details of the system to the public and pointed out that Hong Kong's financial system has the capacity to withstand shocks. The government also reiterated its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. Stability in foreign exchange and monetary markets further reinforced public confidence in the government's determination to maintain the Linked Exchange Rate System and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and preservation of value. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) clearly stated during its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong that the Linked Exchange Rate System is the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, pointing out that Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation serve as the underpinning of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nChart 4: 2016 US Dollar to Hong Kong Dollar Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\nIn the light of the crucial role a sound banking system plays in the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the outcomes of stress tests, and strengthens supervision of banks' personal, corporate, and mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system possesses the resilience to address shocks. Faced with the normalization of US monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank interest rates have begun to rise. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority reminds the public to stay vigilant and be well-prepared to cope with potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 106.7% on December 31, 2016 (Chart 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources can provide strong support for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Changes in Support Rate in 2016\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Monetary Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2016, the Monetary Issuance Committee examined topics including the synchronization of Hong Kong's economic growth with that of mainland China and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and the financial conditions index of Hong Kong. The meeting records of the Monetary Issuance Committee and the reports submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to it on the operation of the currency issuance system are both available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre continues to support research in monetary policy, the banking sector, and the financial sector. In 2016, the research centre invited a total of 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nThis year, the Research Centre organised six international conferences and seminars, primarily including:\n- In January, the \"7th Annual International Seminar on the Chinese Economy\" was held, with the theme \"China's Increasing Influence on the Global Economy.\" During the seminar, eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the Renminbi on the global and regional economies, and the trends and information flows of interest rate differentials between Renminbi markets.\n- In March, the \"Seminar on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was co-hosted by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Keio University, and the Research Centre. The content covered multiple different economic issues, including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, the \"Seminar on Real Estate and Financial Stability\" was co-hosted by the City University of Hong Kong. The papers presented covered topics such as age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamic changes in Hong Kong's housing prices; housing market affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle housing decisions; and the residential property markets in mainland China.\n- In October, a seminar on the Asia-Pacific economic system was co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, with the theme \"Resilience of the Regional Economic System in a Turbulent Global Environment.\" The seminar attracted senior officials from multiple central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organisations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions to exchange views on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. The topics discussed were extensive, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, spillover effects of the slowdown in the mainland economy on other regions, and the impact and outlook for potential growth in Asia.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying levels of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using appropriate terms like \"Centre,\" \"seminar,\" and \"discussing asset quality and financial stability matters.\" It correctly uses \"Mainland China's banking sector\" and \"attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world.\" However, it uses \"within the year\" which is slightly awkward.\n- **Translation 2** has some issues with phrasing, such as \"the 14th annual August seminar,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"examining asset quality and financial stability issues within mainland banks,\" which is slightly less precise than \"discussing asset quality and financial stability matters of mainland banks.\"\n- **Translation 3** is very close to the best version, with correct use of \"Research Centre,\" \"discussing asset quality and financial stability issues of mainland banks,\" and \"exploring a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\" It is fluent and accurate, though it uses \"organised\" for the 21 seminars, which is acceptable.\n- **Translation 4** uses \"China Domestic Economy Seminar\" instead of \"China Mainland Economic Seminar,\" which is not the best match from the dictionary. It also uses \"domestic banks\" instead of \"mainland banks,\" which may be less precise in this context. However, it uses \"public small seminars\" and \"across the country,\" which are acceptable.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"Real Economy Conference\" instead of \"China Mainland Economic Seminar,\" which is not the best match. It also uses \"workshops\" instead of \"seminars,\" which is a minor deviation. However, it uses \"small-scale workshops\" and \"discuss a wide range of economic, monetary and financial issues,\" which are fluent.\n- **Translation 6** is very similar to Translation 3, with the exception of using \"Domestic Economy Seminar\" instead of \"Mainland Economic Seminar,\" which is not the best match. It also uses \"public small-scale seminars\" and \"throughout the year,\" which are appropriate.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Research Centre\" (as per the dictionary), \"China Mainland Economic Seminar\" (best match from the dictionary), \"mainland banks\" (best match for \"內地銀行\"), and \"seminars\" (best match for \"研討會\"). It should also use \"discussing\" or \"examining\" for \"探討\" and \"attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world\" for the last sentence.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Research Centre also held the \"14th Annual Summer Seminar\" in August and the \"14th China Mainland Economic Seminar\" in September, discussing asset quality and financial stability matters of mainland banks. The above meetings and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world. The Research Centre also organised 21 open small seminars throughout the year, discussing a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (referring to banknotes issued by issuing banks) was HK$407.8 billion, an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Charts 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the Government was HK$11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Charts 9 and 10). Among the banknotes and coins issued by the Government, the total value of HK$10 circulating banknotes was HK$4.4 billion, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 86%.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for each term, and the junior translators have produced variations of \"Banking System Stability\" or \"banking stability.\" \nThe most notable issue across all translations is the lack of attention to the hashtag symbol \"#\", which is present in the original text. This symbol is commonly used in digital or social media contexts to denote a topic or label. None of the junior translators included it in their translations, which may be an oversight depending on the intended use of the translation.\nIn terms of terminology, \"銀行體系\" is best translated as \"banking system\" rather than \"banking\" or \"banks.\" \"穩定\" is best rendered as \"stability\" in this context, as it refers to a state of being stable rather than an action to ensure or maintain stability. The use of \"Banking System Stability\" is the most accurate and natural translation of the phrase, and it is used by several junior translators. However, the inclusion of the hashtag is missing in all translations.\nThe best possible translation would be to retain the hashtag and use \"Banking System Stability\" as the title. This preserves the original structure and accurately reflects the meaning of the Chinese text.\n\nDespite the increasing global market risks and turbulence, the Hong Kong banking system remained sound in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened the risk governance frameworks of authorized institutions, as well as the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems during the year. In the light of the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, the HKMA also enhanced its supervision of the technology risk management practices of authorized institutions. To implement the HKMA's commitment to combating financial crimes, the effectiveness of authorized institutions' measures to monitor money laundering and terrorist financing remains a key regulatory focus for the HKMA. In terms of supervising the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric corporate culture and advance financial inclusion, as well as address the difficulties faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and startups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of the practices used by authorized institutions in selling investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policies, the HKMA has made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the net stable funding ratio, large exposure limits, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Supervisory Work\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"authorized institutions\" for \"認可機構.\"\n- The term \"CAMEL\" is consistently translated as \"CAMEL,\" which is appropriate since it is an acronym.\n- The use of \"independent non-executive directors (IneDs)\" is accurate and consistent across translations.\n- The term \"tripartite meetings\" is correctly used for \"聯席會議\" in most translations, with the exception of the fourth translation, which includes \"(联席会议)\" in parentheses, which is unnecessary.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The first and third translations use \"on-site reviews,\" which is incorrect. The original text refers to \"非現場審查,\" which should be translated as \"non-site reviews\" or \"off-site reviews.\"\n- The fourth translation uses \"non-site assessment times,\" which is awkward and incorrect. \"188次非現場審查\" should be \"188 non-site reviews.\"\n- The term \"remuneration\" is used in some translations, which is appropriate, but \"salary\" or \"pay\" could also be used depending on context. However, \"remuneration\" is the most precise term for \"薪酬.\"\n- The term \"assessment\" is used in some translations for \"評估,\" which is acceptable, but \"evaluate\" or \"assess\" could also be used. However, \"assessment\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- The term \"conducive to promoting\" is used in some translations for \"有助促進,\" which is accurate, but \"help promote\" or \"facilitate\" could also be used. However, \"conducive to promoting\" is more formal and appropriate in this context.\n- The term \"tripartite\" is used correctly in most translations, but the fourth translation includes \"(联席会议)\" in parentheses, which is unnecessary and should be omitted.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"off-site reviews\" for \"非現場審查\" to align with the dictionary and common usage.\n- Use \"remuneration systems\" for \"薪酬制度\" to maintain consistency and formality.\n- Use \"assessment\" for \"評估\" to maintain formality and precision.\n- Use \"conducive to promoting\" for \"有助促進\" to maintain formality and precision.\n- Omit unnecessary parenthetical explanations such as \"(联席会议)\" in \"tripartite (联席会议) meetings.\"\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"off-site reviews,\" \"remuneration systems,\" \"assessment,\" and \"conducive to promoting,\" while omitting unnecessary parenthetical explanations.\n**Final Translation:**\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted 188 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its links with the boards of directors of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with the board of directors or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (IneDs) to exchange feedback on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions were conducive to promoting effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy levels, the HKMA reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, in order to be well-prepared for the full implementation of Basel III buffer capital in 2019. The stress tests on the solvency of authorized institutions have also been improved in accordance with the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides feedback on areas needing improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to complement regular on-site inspections with thematic assessments, which are primarily applied to higher-risk areas. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate regulatory resources to address the various new and key risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. The focus of these reviews and assessments remains on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks related to mainland China operations; another key focus is measures to combat money laundering and the monitoring of terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the frequency of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialist review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' businesses related to securities, investment products, insurance, and the mandatory provident fund (MPF).\n\nTable 1 contains an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\nThe original text is a heading, likely from a financial or economic report. The dictionary provides specific translations for the terms \"信貸\" (credit), \"增長\" (growth), and \"資產質\" (asset quality). All junior translators have correctly used \"Credit\" for \"信貸\" and \"Asset Quality\" for \"資產質.\" The term \"增長\" has several possible translations, and all junior translators have used \"Growth,\" which is the most appropriate and commonly used term in this context.\nThe only variation among the translations is the presence of the \"#\" symbol and the capitalization of the heading. In formal or professional contexts, headings are typically capitalized and may or may not include a \"#\" symbol depending on formatting conventions. Since the original text includes a \"#\" symbol, it should be retained in the translation to maintain consistency.\nThe most fluent and natural translation would be \"# Credit Growth and Asset Quality,\" as it preserves the original formatting and uses the most appropriate and commonly accepted terms.\n\nBank loans grew moderately in 2016. The total amount of outstanding loans increased by 6.5% for the year; the growth rate in 2015 was 3.5% (Table 2). Due to the growth rate of customer deposits exceeding that of bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances.\n\nThe original text discusses the increase in related loans in mainland China by 7% to 35,640 billion Hong Kong dollars by the end of 2016, including 5,450 billion Hong Kong dollars in loans from subsidiaries of Hong Kong-registered banks operating in mainland China.\n**Review of Junior Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is mostly accurate, but \"HK$35,640 billion\" is incorrect. The term \"億\" translates to \"billion,\" so \"35,640 billion\" is redundant and should be \"HK$356.4 billion.\" Also, \"operating in mainland China\" is slightly vague.\n2. **Second junior translator:** The use of \"Mainland China\" is consistent, but \"35,640 billion Hong Kong dollars\" is again incorrect. The number should be \"HK$356.4 billion.\" The phrase \"established in the Mainland by banks registered in Hong Kong\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation correctly uses \"HK$356.4 billion\" and \"HK$54.5 billion,\" which are accurate based on the dictionary. However, \"accounted for by\" is slightly off; \"recorded by\" or \"included in\" would be more precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** The use of \"Chart 3\" is acceptable, but \"domiciliation\" is not the best fit for \"設\" in this context. \"Established\" or \"set up\" would be more natural. Also, \"545 billion\" is incorrect; it should be \"5,450 billion.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very close to correct, using \"HK dollars\" and the correct numbers. However, \"established in mainland China\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** The use of \"Within the mainland\" is not standard. \"In mainland China\" is more natural. Also, \"545 billion\" is incorrect; it should be \"5,450 billion.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"in mainland China\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Correctly translate \"億\" to \"billion\" and ensure the numbers are accurate (35,640 billion = 356.4 billion).\n- Use \"established\" for \"設\" and \"subsidiaries\" for \"附屬.\"\n- Use \"recorded by\" or \"included in\" for \"入帳.\"\n- Ensure \"表3\" is translated as \"Table 3.\"\n- Use \"HK$\" consistently for \"港元.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe total amount of related loans in mainland China increased by 7% to HK$356.4 billion at the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HK$54.5 billion in loans recorded by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong established in mainland China.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained sound in 2016. Despite the specific classified loan ratio for retail banking rising slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained well below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of mainland-related loans in the banking sector showed a similar trend during the year; at the same time, the specific classified loan ratio for these loans in retail banking rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the related ratio for the overall banking sector also rose slightly from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using appropriate terms from the dictionary (e.g., \"provisioning,\" \"thematic assessments\"). It correctly uses \"maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems\" and \"credit risks arising from investments in debt securities aimed at increasing revenue.\" However, it uses \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may be an issue for a general audience.\n2. **Translation 2** is also fluent and accurate, with a slightly more formal tone. It uses \"increasing credit risk exposure\" and \"investments in debt securities aimed at increasing returns,\" which are appropriate. It also correctly uses \"thematic assessment\" and \"authorized institutions.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very similar to Translation 1, with minor variations in phrasing. It uses \"sustained increase\" and \"credit risk arising from investments in debt securities aimed at increasing returns.\" It is fluent and accurate.\n4. **Translation 4** is accurate and uses \"allocated substantial regulatory resources\" and \"continuous increase in risk exposure.\" It also includes \"during the supervisory process,\" which is a direct translation of the original text. However, \"to increase profits\" is slightly less formal than \"to increase returns.\"\n5. **Translation 5** has a minor error: \"system制度\" is a direct translation of \"system制度\" from the original, but it should be \"system\" only. It also uses \"increased business\" instead of \"increasing returns,\" which is less precise. It uses \"assessment\" instead of \"thematic assessment,\" which is less specific.\n6. **Translation 6** is fluent and accurate, using \"investing significant supervisory resources\" and \"thematic assessment.\" It also includes \"during the supervisory process,\" which is a direct translation. However, it uses \"risks associated with Chinese enterprises\" instead of \"private enterprises,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the formal tone of the original text and avoid unnecessary deviations. Based on the above review, the best translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, ensuring that all dictionary terms are used correctly and that the overall tone is consistent.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA has invested significant supervisory resources to ensure that authorised institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. During the supervisory process, the HKMA also pays special attention to the continued increase in risk exposure of authorised institutions to mainland China's private enterprises, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities aimed at increasing returns. In addition, the HKMA conducts a thematic assessment of the credit risk management of authorised institutions in relation to the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\nThe original text is \"# 物業按揭貸款\". The term \"物業\" should be translated as \"property\" or \"properties,\" and \"貸款\" should be translated as \"loans,\" \"loan,\" or \"lending.\" The term \"按揭\" is not in the dictionary, but it is commonly translated as \"mortgage\" in financial contexts.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators all attempt to capture the meaning of the original text. However, there are some inconsistencies and issues with the translations:\n1. The first junior translator's translation, \"Property mortgage loans,\" is concise and accurate, but it lacks the hashtag symbol that is present in the original text.\n2. The second and third junior translators both translated the text as \"# Property Mortgage Loans,\" which is accurate and includes the hashtag symbol. However, the use of \"Loans\" with a capital \"L\" is inconsistent with the lowercase \"loans\" used in the other translations.\n3. The fourth junior translator's translation, \"Property Mortgage Loans,\" is similar to the second and third translations, but it omits the hashtag symbol.\n4. The fifth junior translator's translation, \"Property loans,\" is less accurate because it omits the term \"mortgage,\" which is an essential part of the original text.\n5. The sixth junior translator's translation, \"Property Mortgage Loan,\" is similar to the first junior translator's translation, but it uses the singular form \"Loan\" instead of the plural form \"Loans.\"\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would be \"# Property Mortgage Loans,\" as it accurately captures the meaning of the original text, includes the hashtag symbol, and uses the correct plural form of the word \"Loans.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"HKMA\" and \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"debt-to-income ratio\" instead of \"debt service-to-income ratio,\" which may not be the most precise term in this context.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"countercyclical\" correctly and \"debt service-to-income ratio,\" which is more precise than \"debt-to-income ratio.\" It also uses \"Figure 1\" instead of \"Chart 1,\" which is acceptable but slightly inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Chart.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and includes awkward phrasing, such as \"loan repayment with income ratio,\" which is not standard terminology. It also uses \"counter cyclical\" with a space, which is incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"countercyclical\" correctly and \"debt service-to-income ratio.\" It also uses \"Figure 1,\" which is acceptable but not the exact match from the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"counter-cyclical\" with a hyphen, which is correct. It also uses \"Chart 1\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"debt-to-income ratio\" instead of \"debt service-to-income ratio.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"countercyclical\" correctly and \"debt-to-income ratio.\" It also uses \"Chart 1\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"cap on debt-to-income ratios\" instead of \"debt service-to-income ratio.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"debt service-to-income ratio\" is more precise in the context of mortgage lending than \"debt-to-income ratio.\"\n- \"Chart 1\" is the exact match from the dictionary and should be used consistently.\n- \"Counter-cyclical\" with a hyphen is the correct form.\n- \"HKMA\" should be used consistently as the authorized institution.\n- The phrase \"newly granted\" is more precise than \"new\" in the context of loans.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA continues to closely monitor the property loan business of authorised institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential property mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of counter-cyclical property loan measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt service-to-income ratio for newly granted residential property mortgages also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on debt service-to-income ratios, to 34% in December 2016 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for Newly Granted Residential Property Mortgages  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a cap on the repayment-to-income ratio before launching the first round of counter-cyclical property loan measures.\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% lower bound for credit risk-weighted amounts from newly granted mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This provision took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore real estate developers have been providing mortgage loans directly to property buyers within the year, often with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios higher than the levels permitted under the prudential requirements imposed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on authorized institutions. The HKMA closely monitors this development and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their risk exposure to property developers. In addition, at the request of the HKMA, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. Authorized institutions using this service will receive electronic alert messages issued by the Land Registry when other mortgage documents relating to properties they have mortgaged are submitted to the Land Registry for registration. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgage loans on the same property without prior approval from the authorized institution taking the mortgage. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Regulatory Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centres, Hong Kong faces increasingly growing cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from authorised institutions about cases involving unauthorised stock trading and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, and immediately took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued electronic banking service tips, reminding the public to be cautious of online stock trading scams and recommending that the public take preventive measures. The HKMA also issued notices to authorised institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be taken to further strengthen the monitoring of online banking services. Regarding cases of attempts to infiltrate banking payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorised institutions to be vigilant about such scams when the first related case was identified in Hong Kong, and with the assistance of the police, explained the modus operandi of such scams, as well as required authorised institutions to take into account these methods when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system's resilience to cyber risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative in May 2016. This initiative comprises three pillars: the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework, the Professional Training Programme, and the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Platform (see the section on \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" in the chapter titled \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\"). In December, the HKMA issued a notice to authorized institutions, outlining the implementation timeline for the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are variations in fluency, grammar, and the use of specific terms from the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Accuracy and Use of Dictionary Terms**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"Fintech,\" \"HKMA,\" \"biometric authentication,\" \"person-to-person small-value payment services,\" and \"blockchain.\" However, some translations use \"Fintech\" with a lowercase \"f\" inconsistently, which should be standardized as \"Fintech\" when referring to the industry or concept.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: The translations are mostly fluent, but some sentences are slightly awkward or repetitive. For example, \"to help cope with the increasing demand\" is repeated in multiple translations, and while grammatically correct, it could be more concise or varied.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: The translations are culturally appropriate, as they use standard financial and regulatory terminology that is commonly used in English-speaking financial contexts.\n4. **Consistency in Terminology**: Some translations use \"HKMA\" consistently, while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" in full. It is better to use \"HKMA\" once it has been introduced, unless the full name is necessary for clarity.\n5. **Tense and Style**: The translations vary in tense and style. Some use past tense consistently, while others mix past and present tense. A consistent past tense is more appropriate for a historical account like this.\n6. **Word Choice and Nuance**: Some translations use \"facilitate appropriate amendments\" or \"make appropriate modifications,\" which are both acceptable, but \"make appropriate modifications\" is slightly more direct and natural in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation should maintain consistency in terminology, use past tense for historical events, and ensure clarity and fluency in expression.\nFinal Translation:\nThe application of Fintech in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new Fintech products. Notably, developments in person-to-person small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication stood out. In September, the HKMA introduced the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to conduct pilot trials of their Fintech projects in a controlled environment without needing to fully comply with the HKMA's regulatory requirements. This arrangement enables authorized institutions to collect real data and user feedback early on before officially launching their Fintech services, facilitating appropriate modifications. As of the end of 2016, six applications for using the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox were approved, involving new Fintech products related to biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also increased the transaction limit for online banking person-to-person small-value payment services without requiring dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account daily, to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple property-related fraud cases occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners in an attempt to gain benefits by applying for mortgage loans or selling the relevant properties. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) still closely collaborated with the police and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Bankers' Association) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such fraud cases within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operational Incident Communications\" to share lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred at authorized institutions with the industry. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' business operations risk management systems, fraud management approaches, trust\/custody business operations, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant transaction activities.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risks\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管,\" translates to \"Regulatory Oversight of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risks.\" The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for key terms, including \"財資\" (treasury), \"業務\" (business), \"流動性\" (liquidity), \"風險\" (risk, risks, vulnerabilities), and \"監管\" (supervisory, supervision, regulatory, regulation, supervise). \nThe first and second translations both use \"Regulatory Supervision\" and \"Regulatory Oversight,\" which are both appropriate, though \"oversight\" may carry a slightly more formal and comprehensive connotation, suggesting a broader supervisory role. \"Supervision\" is also correct but slightly narrower in scope.\nThe third translation is identical to the second, so it shares the same strengths and weaknesses.\nThe fourth translation, \"Treasury business and liquidity risks supervisory,\" is grammatically incorrect and lacks proper structure. It fails to use a verb or proper noun form, making it an incomplete phrase.\nThe fifth translation, \"Treasury business and liquidity risk regulation,\" is grammatically correct but less precise. \"Regulation\" refers more to the rules or laws themselves, rather than the act of overseeing or managing them, which is what \"supervision\" or \"oversight\" implies.\nThe sixth translation, \"Supervision of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risks,\" is grammatically sound and uses \"supervision\" appropriately. However, it lacks the \"regulatory\" component, which is important for emphasizing the legal or institutional nature of the oversight.\n**Improved Translation:**\n# Regulatory Oversight of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risks\nThis translation uses \"Regulatory Oversight\" to capture the institutional and legal nature of the supervisory function, \"Treasury Business\" to accurately reflect \"財資業務,\" and \"Liquidity Risks\" to correctly translate \"流動性風險.\" The structure is clear, grammatically correct, and culturally appropriate for an English-speaking audience.\n\nIn 2016, several major political events occurred, leading to marked fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. At the same time, U.S. interest rates continued to normalize slowly, with the Federal Open Market Committee deciding in December to raise the federal funds rate, which was the second time since the global financial crisis. To be well-prepared for these political events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to maintain close contact with overseas regulatory institutions, assessing the impact of the events on the Hong Kong banking system, and urging banks to stay vigilant and strengthen their risk management to cope with adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of translation quality, all six translations capture the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with appropriate use of terms like \"cope with severe stress scenarios\" and \"take corrective actions.\" However, \"follow-up actions on authorized institutions\" is slightly awkward compared to \"followed up with authorized institutions.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"followed up with authorized institutions\" and \"monitoring deficiencies,\" which are natural and precise. However, \"on interest rate risk management\" is slightly less clear than \"aimed at interest rate risk management.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"followed up with authorized institutions to further strengthen their capacity to respond,\" which is natural. However, the phrase \"conducted by the HKMA in 2015 on interest rate risk management\" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate, with the use of \"capacity of the banking system\" and \"insufficient monitoring capabilities.\" However, \"carried out additional on-site reviews\" is slightly less natural than \"conducted additional on-site reviews.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation has some issues, such as \"severe stress environment\" (should be \"severe stress scenarios\") and \"market risks management\" (should be \"market risk management\"). Also, \"undertook follow-up actions with authorised institutions to further strengthen their ability\" is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"resilience\" and \"insufficient controls,\" which are appropriate. However, \"on-site examination\" is slightly less common than \"on-site reviews.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"cope with potential severe stress scenarios\" for clarity and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"followed up with authorized institutions to further strengthen their resilience\" for fluency and precision.\n- Use \"aimed at interest rate risk management\" for clarity.\n- Use \"conducted additional on-site reviews\" for consistency and natural phrasing.\n- Use \"market risk management\" instead of \"market risks management.\"\n- Use \"insufficient controls\" for precision and consistency with the dictionary.\n**Improved Translation**:\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system’s ability to cope with potential severe stress scenarios, and followed up with authorized institutions to further strengthen their resilience. Following a round of on-site reviews aimed at interest rate risk management in 2015, the HKMA conducted additional on-site reviews to assess the market risk management of authorized institutions, and required those institutions with insufficient controls to make corrections.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動,\" translates to \"Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities.\" The dictionary provides specific translations for key terms: \"洗\" should be \"anti-money laundering,\" \"籌集\" should be \"financing,\" \"資金\" should be \"funds\" or \"funding,\" and \"活動\" should be \"activities.\"\n1. **First junior translator:** \"Combat money laundering and terrorist fund-raising activities.\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"fund-raising\" for \"籌集,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Combat\" is less formal than \"Combating.\" \"Fund-raising\" may not be the best fit for \"籌集\" in this context, as it implies a more voluntary or charitable act, whereas \"financing\" is more neutral and appropriate for illicit activities.\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities\"  \n   - Strengths: Accurately uses \"financing\" for \"籌集\" and \"Combating\" as the verb.  \n   - Weaknesses: The use of a hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary unless the original text intended it as a heading or title marker.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"Combating anti-money laundering and fund-raising activities for terrorist funds.\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Combating\" and \"fund-raising.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: Misinterprets \"洗\" as \"anti-money laundering\" instead of using it as part of \"money laundering.\" Also, \"fund-raising\" is again less appropriate than \"financing.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"# Combating Anti-Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorist Activities\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"financing\" and \"Combating.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: Misplaces \"anti-money laundering\" as a noun instead of part of the verb phrase \"money laundering.\" Also, the hashtag is unnecessary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Fund-Raising Activities\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Combating\" and \"Fund-Raising.\"  \n   - Weaknesses: \"Fund-Raising\" is again less appropriate than \"financing\" in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"Combating anti-money laundering and the raising (of funds) for terrorist activities.\"  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"Combating\" and \"raising (of funds).\"  \n   - Weaknesses: Misinterprets \"洗\" as \"anti-money laundering\" instead of \"money laundering.\" Also, \"raising (of funds)\" is unnecessarily parenthetical and less natural.\n**Improved Translation:**\nCombating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities\nThis translation uses the most accurate and natural terms from the dictionary, avoids unnecessary punctuation, and maintains the formal tone appropriate for the subject matter.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use appropriate equivalents from the dictionary, such as \"risk-based anti-money laundering,\" \"on-site reviews,\" \"off-site reviews,\" and \"sanctions compliance.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the meaning is preserved across all versions.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent in most translations, which is appropriate for the context.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"supervision\" while others use \"regulatory framework\" or \"regime.\" The dictionary lists \"supervisory,\" \"supervision,\" \"regulatory,\" and \"regulation\" as possible translations for \"監管.\" While all are acceptable, \"supervision\" is more precise in this context.\n- **Word Choice for \"人員\":** The dictionary lists several options, including \"executive,\" \"personnel,\" \"staff,\" \"members,\" and \"employees.\" \"Staff\" or \"personnel\" are more natural in this context than \"executive\" or \"members.\"\n- **\"審查\" vs. \"examination\":** While \"review\" and \"examination\" are both acceptable, \"review\" is more commonly used in regulatory contexts.\n- **\"內容\" as \"content\":** \"Content\" is too vague. \"Coverage\" or \"scope\" would be more appropriate.\n- **\"專項監管人員\" as \"specialized supervisory personnel\":** This is accurate, but \"specialized staff\" or \"specialist staff\" is more natural in English.\n- **\"落實\" as \"implementation\":** While correct, \"implementation\" is more formal and fits well in this context.\n- **\"非現場審查\" as \"off-site reviews\":** This is accurate and consistent across translations.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nTo produce the best possible translation, we should:\n- Use \"supervision\" consistently for \"監管.\"\n- Use \"review\" for \"審查\" as it is more natural in regulatory contexts.\n- Use \"coverage\" or \"scope\" for \"內容.\"\n- Use \"specialist staff\" or \"specialized staff\" for \"專項監管人員.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are translated using the most natural and context-appropriate English equivalents.\n**Final Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) risk-based anti-money laundering supervision includes on-site reviews and off-site reviews (including regulatory liaison with authorized institutions regarding specific events), primarily targeting areas with higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The review scope covers the authorized institutions' assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of risk-based approaches, as well as the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the HKMA's specialist staff conducted 17 on-site reviews and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the HKMA prioritizes addressing situations where certain industries and individuals encounter difficulties in opening bank accounts, and issues guidance and \"Frequently Asked Questions\" to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA's regulatory expectations regarding a risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continues to closely cooperate with industry associations, issuing guidance to help authorized institutions manage risks in certain areas, such as money laundering activities related to trade.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1

人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

generally accurate but vary in fluency and formatting. The first translation, \"Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre,\" is grammatically correct and fluent, but it uses \"status\" instead of \"position\" or \"role\" from the dictionary. While \"status\" is a valid translation for \"地位,\" it may not be the most precise in this context, where \"position\" or \"role\" might better convey the idea of a designated or functional standing.\nThe second translation, \"Hong Kong’s International financial centre status,\" has a capitalization issue with \"International\" and lacks the article \"an\" before \"international financial centre,\" which is necessary for grammatical correctness.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth translations all use the exact same format: \"# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status.\" While this format is visually consistent, the use of the hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary and does not align with standard English title formatting unless it is intended for a specific platform or style guide. Additionally, \"International Financial Centre\" is capitalized unnecessarily, as it should only be capitalized if it is part of a proper noun or title.\nThe sixth translation, \"Hong Kong’s international financial centre status,\" is the most grammatically correct and fluent among the options. It uses lowercase for \"international\" as required by the dictionary, and it correctly places the article \"an\" before \"international financial centre\" if it were to be used in a full sentence. However, it still uses \"status\" instead of \"position\" or \"role,\" which could be more appropriate depending on the intended nuance.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be \"Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.\" This version uses \"position\" from the dictionary, which is more precise in this context, and it includes the necessary article \"an\" for grammatical correctness. It also avoids unnecessary capitalization and formatting, ensuring a natural and fluent English expression.\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. Last year's tax amendments helped create a favorable environment, attracting multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office within the year. During the year, the HKMA granted 13 licenses to issuers of stored value payment facilities. Hong Kong's sound fiscal performance and substantial net external asset position continue to be recognized by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\n受到全球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n**Translation:**\nAffected by global financial market volatility and uncertainty in the outlook for the RMB exchange rate, global offshore RMB business slowed in 2016. Despite this, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global hub for offshore RMB business, handling about 70% of global RMB payment transactions. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism, launched in December, marked another milestone in the liberalization of China's capital account and was an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding support for RMB liquidity in the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of RMB market liquidity.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and fluent, but they vary in terms of precision, consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub\" and \"tax incentives.\" It also accurately translates \"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority\" and \"overseas office.\" However, it uses \"the end of January 2017\" instead of \"as of the end of January 2017,\" which is slightly less precise.\n2. **Second Translation**: This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"develop Hong Kong as a hub for infrastructure financing\" and \"tax asymmetry.\" It also correctly uses \"Mainland\" instead of \"mainland\" and \"corporate treasury centres.\" However, it uses \"the only office the institution has set up outside Abu Dhabi,\" which is slightly less formal than the alternatives.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"develop Hong Kong into a financing hub for infrastructure\" and \"legal amendments.\" It also correctly uses \"tax asymmetries\" and \"corporate treasury centers.\" However, it uses \"the only office of the institution located outside of Abu Dhabi,\" which is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is very strong. It uses \"develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing centre\" and \"tax incentives.\" It also correctly uses \"more than 60 institutions\" and \"the institution's only office located outside of Abu Dhabi.\" It is the most concise and natural-sounding of the translations.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is accurate but slightly less precise. It uses \"positioning Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing hub\" and \"finance centers\" instead of \"corporate treasury centers.\" It also uses \"announced in October to establish\" instead of \"announced in October the establishment of,\" which is less formal.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation has some grammatical issues, such as \"have already joined\" instead of \"had joined\" and \"successfully promote\" instead of \"successfully promoted.\" It also uses \"corporate investors\" instead of \"institutional investors,\" which is less accurate.\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and consistent with the dictionary. It should use \"develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing hub,\" \"tax incentives,\" \"corporate treasury centres,\" and \"the institution's only office located outside of Abu Dhabi.\" It should also use \"as of the end of January 2017\" and \"more than 60 institutions.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing hub. As of the end of January 2017, more than 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully promoted the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, thereby bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors with operations in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is the world's third-largest sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the institution's only office located outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the key terms and use appropriate dictionary alternatives, such as \"International Monetary Fund (IMF)\" for \"國際貨幣基金組織\" and \"financial centre\" for \"金融中心.\"\n- The use of \"positive evaluation\" or \"positive assessment\" aligns with the dictionary's \"正\" as \"positive.\"\n- The term \"Fourth Article\" is consistently used for \"第四條,\" which is accurate.\n- The phrase \"maintained close communication\" is a strong and natural rendering of \"保持緊密溝通.\"\n- The use of \"helped confirm\" or \"helped obtain recognition\" for \"有助...確認\" is appropriate and aligns with the dictionary's \"有助\" and \"確認.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"discussion\" instead of \"consultation\" for \"磋商,\" which is less precise. The term \"consultation\" is more appropriate in the context of IMF discussions.\n- The phrase \"within the year\" is awkward and less natural than \"throughout the year\" or \"during the year.\"\n- The use of \"dedicated to advance\" in one translation is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"dedicated to advancing.\"\n- Some translations use \"discussion\" instead of \"discussions\" when plural is needed, such as in \"international discussions.\"\n- The term \"institutions\" is used for \"機構,\" but \"agencies\" or \"institutions\" are both acceptable, though \"institutions\" is more general and appropriate in this context.\n- The phrase \"helped Hong Kong's credit rating obtain recognition\" is slightly awkward compared to \"helped confirm Hong Kong's credit rating.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"consultation\" for \"磋商\" to reflect the formal nature of the IMF process.\n- Use \"throughout the year\" or \"during the year\" for \"年內\" to convey the time frame naturally.\n- Ensure grammatical correctness, such as using \"dedicated to advancing\" instead of \"dedicated to advance.\"\n- Use \"discussions\" in plural where appropriate.\n- Use \"institutions\" or \"agencies\" for \"機構\" depending on context, but \"institutions\" is more general and appropriate here.\n- Use \"helped confirm\" for \"有助...確認\" to maintain clarity and conciseness.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive evaluation of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre during last year's Fourth Article consultation. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participated in international discussions, dedicated to advancing global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating institutions, and this work helped confirm Hong Kong's credit rating by major credit rating institutions in 2016.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent and accurate, using \"consolidating\" and \"position as\" effectively. It correctly uses \"real-time gross settlement (RTGS)\" and \"debt instrument central settlement system (CMU system)\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"achieved 100% system availability\" without specifying \"rate,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n- **Translation 2** uses \"continued Development\" with a capital \"D,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary's lowercase \"development.\" It also uses \"Real time gross Settlement\" with inconsistent capitalization. The phrase \"global hub for offshore renminbi business\" is accurate but could be more concise.\n- **Translation 3** is fluent and accurate, using \"strengthening\" and \"continued development.\" It correctly uses \"real-time payment settlement (RTGS)\" but \"payment settlement\" is not the exact term in the dictionary (which lists \"settlement system\"). It also uses \"Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU)\" correctly.\n- **Translation 4** is very close to the best version, using \"continued development\" and \"real-time gross settlement (RTGS)\" correctly. However, it uses \"central clearing system\" instead of \"central settlement system,\" which is slightly off from the dictionary's \"settlement system.\"\n- **Translation 5** uses \"system availability rate\" correctly, but the phrase \"Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure’s safe and effective operation\" is awkwardly worded. It also uses \"central clearing system\" instead of \"central settlement system.\"\n- **Translation 6** uses \"sustainable development\" instead of \"continued development,\" which is not the best fit for the context. It also uses \"RMB\" instead of \"Renminbi\" or \"renminbi,\" which is acceptable but less formal than the dictionary's options.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"continued development\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"real-time gross settlement (RTGS)\" with correct capitalization.\n- Use \"central settlement system\" for \"CMU system.\"\n- Use \"system availability rate\" to match the original's \"系統可供使用率.\"\n- Use \"Renminbi\" or \"renminbi\" for consistency with the dictionary.\n- Maintain a natural, fluent tone without awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe safe and effective operation and continued development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play an important role in strengthening Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre and a global offshore Renminbi business hub. The four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and the debt instrument central settlement system (CMU system), which handle interbank transactions, achieved 100% system availability rate in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"stored value facilities licences\" and \"came into force.\" However, \"coverage of e-cheque services has also been expanded\" is slightly awkward compared to \"has also been extended.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is very close to the first, with the only difference being \"came into full effect\" instead of \"came into force.\" Both are acceptable, but \"came into force\" is more standard in legal contexts.\n3. **Third junior translator**: Uses \"enhanced\" instead of \"strengthened,\" which is acceptable but less direct. Also, \"stored value payment tool licenses\" is not an exact match for the dictionary term \"stored value facilities.\" Additionally, \"fully effective\" is not a standard legal term for \"take effect.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is the most accurate and fluent translation. It uses \"extended\" instead of \"expanded,\" which is more natural in this context. It also correctly uses \"stored value payment facilities licenses\" and \"came into full effect.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: Similar to the fourth, but uses \"Payment Facility Ordinance\" instead of \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"came into force in full\" is awkward phrasing.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: Uses \"advanced\" instead of \"strengthened,\" which is less precise. Also, \"stored value tool licences\" is not an exact match for the dictionary term \"stored value facilities.\" Additionally, \"e-cheque services coverage has also expanded\" is less natural than \"has also been extended.\"\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"金管局\" should be translated as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"\n- \"進一步加強\" should be \"further strengthened.\"\n- \"零售支付金融基建\" should be \"retail payment financial infrastructure.\"\n- \"總共13個儲值支付工具牌照\" should be \"a total of 13 stored value payment facilities licences.\"\n- \"電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付\" should be \"the coverage of electronic cheque services has also been extended to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\"\n- \"《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》\" should be \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the 'Payment Ordinance').\"\n- \"2016年11月全面生效\" should be \"which came into full effect in November 2016.\"\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored value payment facilities licences were granted under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), which came into full effect in November 2016. The coverage of electronic cheque services has also been extended to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of Hong Kong's fintech, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key measures implemented during the year have all achieved ideal progress.\n\nThe HKMA has launched a series of measures to strengthen the soft power of the banking sector, including (i) launching a programme to enhance the professional capabilities of directors; (ii) establishing an overall industry framework for the professional qualifications of banking professionals; and (iii) implementing a consumer education programme.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Offshore Renminbi Business\n# 離岸人民幣業務\nThe original text is a title, likely referring to a financial or economic sector. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for the key terms \"人民\" and \"幣,\" with \"Renminbi\" and \"RMB\" being the most appropriate and commonly used terms in this context. \"離岸\" is clearly \"offshore,\" and \"業務\" is best translated as \"business\" in this context.\nReview of the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"Offshore Renminbi Business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Renminbi\" and \"Business\" with proper capitalization.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The title lacks a hashtag, which may be important for formatting or categorization purposes.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# Offshore Renminbi Business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Includes the hashtag, which aligns with the original text's formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The capitalization of \"Business\" is inconsistent with the rest of the title.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"Offshore Renminbi business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Renminbi\" and includes the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Business\" is lowercase, which may be less formal or less appropriate for a title.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# Offshore RMB business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"RMB\" and includes the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Business\" is lowercase, and \"RMB\" is less formal than \"Renminbi\" in this context.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"Offshore Renminbi Business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Renminbi\" and \"Business\" with proper capitalization.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag, which may be important for formatting.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"Offshore Renminbi business\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Renminbi\" and includes the hashtag.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Business\" is lowercase, which may be less appropriate for a title.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**\n- The original text includes a hashtag, so the translation should preserve this.\n- \"Renminbi\" is more formal and appropriate for a title than \"RMB.\"\n- \"Business\" should be capitalized as it is part of the title.\n- Consistency in formatting and capitalization is important for clarity and professionalism.\n**Improved translation:**\n# Offshore Renminbi Business\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, numerical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of the translations:\n1. **First Junior Translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with correct use of terms from the dictionary. The numbers are correctly converted (e.g., 6,251億元 as RMB625.1 billion). The structure is clear and professional, and the use of \"financial intermediation activities\" is appropriate.\n2. **Second Junior Translator**: This translation has several issues. The number \"6,251億元\" is incorrectly translated as \"RMB18 billion,\" which is a significant error. Additionally, \"45,421億元\" is translated as \"4,542.1 billion Renminbi,\" which is also incorrect. The term \"bank’s\" is used inconsistently and incorrectly. The translation is less fluent and contains several numerical errors.\n3. **Third Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate in terms of meaning and structure. However, it incorrectly translates \"6,251億元\" as \"RMB 6,251 billion,\" which is a misinterpretation of the original number. The term \"deposits certificates\" is not a standard phrase and should be \"deposit certificates.\" The translation is otherwise fluent and professional.\n4. **Fourth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The numbers are correctly converted (e.g., 6,251億元 as RMB625.1 billion). The use of \"financial intermediary activities\" is appropriate, and the structure is clear. The only minor issue is the use of \"renminbi\" in lowercase, which should be capitalized as \"Renminbi\" or \"RMB\" depending on context.\n5. **Fifth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The numbers are correctly converted, and the structure is clear. The use of \"financial intermediation activities\" is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"RMB454.21 billion\" instead of \"RMB4,542.1 billion,\" which is a decimal placement error.\n6. **Sixth Junior Translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. The numbers are correctly converted, and the structure is clear. The use of \"financial intermediation activities\" is appropriate. The only minor issue is the use of \"renminbi\" in lowercase, which should be capitalized as \"Renminbi\" or \"RMB\" depending on context.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should be fluent, accurate, and adhere to the dictionary terms. It should also correctly convert the numerical values and use appropriate financial terminology. Based on the above review, the first and fourth translations are the most accurate and fluent. However, the first translation has a minor issue with the term \"financial intermediation activities,\" which is slightly less common than \"financial intermediation.\" The fourth translation is slightly more natural in phrasing and uses \"financial intermediary activities\" more appropriately.\n**Improved Translation**:\nIn 2016, global financial market volatility and uncertainty regarding the Renminbi exchange rate outlook led to a moderation in global offshore Renminbi business. As of year-end, the combined balance of Renminbi customer deposits and deposit certificates in Hong Kong amounted to RMB625.1 billion, a 38% decrease compared to the previous year (Figure 1). During the year, the issuance of offshore Renminbi bonds fell to RMB52.8 billion, and the settlement amount of Renminbi trade processed by Hong Kong banks also declined to RMB4,542.1 billion. On the other hand, the balance of Renminbi loans held by Hong Kong banks as of year-end remained similar to the previous year (Figure 2), at RMB294.8 billion. The transaction volume of the Renminbi RTGS system remained at a high level, with an average daily transaction amount of RMB863.6 billion in 2016. This demonstrates that, despite a reduction in the Renminbi funding pool, a large volume of Renminbi financial intermediary activities continued to take place in Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of Renminbi payment transactions in 2016, demonstrating its position as a global hub for offshore Renminbi business.\n\nChart 1 RMB Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates\n\nFigure 2 Renminbi financing activities\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and follow the dictionary guidelines. However, there are a few points worth noting:\n1. **Capitalization of \"Renminbi\" and \"RMB\"**: The term \"Renminbi\" is a proper noun and should be capitalized when used as a name. \"RMB\" is an abbreviation and should also be capitalized. The translations that use \"Renminbi\" with a capital \"R\" are more appropriate in formal contexts.\n2. **Consistency in Capitalization**: Some translations capitalize \"Financing Activities\" while others use lowercase. In formal or academic contexts, it is more common to capitalize the main terms in a title, such as \"Financing Activities.\"\n3. **Use of \"Figure\" vs. \"Chart\"**: The term \"圖\" can be translated as \"Figure\" or \"Chart.\" In academic or financial contexts, \"Figure\" is more commonly used for numbered illustrations, so \"Figure 2\" is more appropriate than \"Chart 2.\"\n4. **Fluency and Style**: All translations are fluent and grammatically correct. However, using \"Renminbi\" with a capital \"R\" and capitalizing \"Financing Activities\" would make the title more consistent with formal writing standards.\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be:\n**Figure 2 Renminbi Financing Activities**\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely cooperated with relevant mainland authorities to secure greater policy space and promote the development of Hong Kong's RMB business. Several new measures were introduced during the year, including further liberalization of the mainland's interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as the launch of the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect\" in December. In response to increased demand for liquidity management in cross-border investment channels and markets, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity arrangements. In October, the HKMA increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and the total amount of the program was also raised from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion. The transparency of the usage of the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements was also improved, helping participating banks to more effectively manage their liquidity.\n\nThe original text discusses the reaffirmation of Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub in the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" announced in March, and highlights the central government's support for its further development in this area.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"affirmed\" and \"further development\" appropriately. However, \"the central government's support\" could be more precise by using \"the central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very close to the best version. It uses \"affirmed\" and \"further develop\" correctly. However, \"Government\" should be lowercase unless it's part of a proper noun like \"Hong Kong Government.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is fluent and accurate. It uses \"status\" and \"RMB\" appropriately. However, \"further development of offshore RMB business\" is slightly less precise than \"further develop its offshore RMB business.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation is less fluent. The structure \"In the national... announced in March, Hong Kong’s position...\" is awkward. Also, \"support to further development\" is grammatically incorrect.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is very strong. It uses \"once again affirmed,\" \"status,\" and \"further develop its offshore Renminbi business\" effectively. It is the most natural and accurate translation so far.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is also strong. It uses \"reaffirmed\" and \"further develop its offshore RMB business\" effectively. However, \"the global offshore RMB business hub\" could be more precise as \"a global offshore RMB business hub.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"reaffirmed\" to reflect the repeated affirmation, \"status\" to denote the position, \"RMB\" for consistency, and \"further develop its offshore RMB business\" to show the active development by Hong Kong. The structure should be clear and natural, avoiding awkward phrasing.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe national \"13th Five-Year Plan,\" announced in March, once again reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA also actively participates in various activities to promote Hong Kong's role as a global hub for offshore RMB business and as a springboard for China's \"going global\" strategy, including participating in local events organized by industry organizations and private institutions, as well as overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the UK.\n\n# Arrangements for Closer Economic and Trade Relations between Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nUnder the framework of the Arrangement on the Establishment of a Closer Economic and Trade Relationship between the Mainland and Hong Kong, a new agreement concerning the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expansion of the mainland market's openness and facilitation measures for Hong Kong's financial sector.\nUnder the framework of the Arrangement on the Establishment of a Closer Economic and Trade Relationship between the Mainland and Hong Kong, a new agreement concerning the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation situation of the measures under the existing arrangements, and with the Government Administration cooperation explore further leveraging on the opening and facilitating measures of the Mainland markets to the Hong Kong of the industry.\nThis translation contains several errors, including awkward phrasing such as \"on establishing more close economic and trade relationship\" (should be \"on establishing a closer economic and trade relationship\"), \"the Hong Kong of the industry\" (incorrect phrasing), and \"leverage on the opening\" (should be \"leverage on opening\" or \"capitalizing on opening\"). The use of \"substantially achieving liberalization\" is also less precise than \"basic realization of service trade liberalization.\"\nUnder the framework of the arrangement concerning the establishment of more closely knit economic and trade relations between Mainland and Hong Kong, a new agreement on the basic implementation of services trade liberalisation between Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the existing arrangement, and cooperate with the Government to explore further expansion of Mainland markets’ openness and facilitation measures for Hong Kong’s financial sector.\nThis translation is mostly accurate but has minor issues, such as \"more closely knit economic and trade relations\" (which is slightly awkward), and \"basic implementation\" (which is less precise than \"basic realization\"). The use of \"cooperate\" instead of \"collaborates\" is also slightly less formal than the original.\nUnder the framework of the \"Arrangement on the Establishment of a Closer Economic and Trade Relationship between the Mainland and Hong Kong,\" a new agreement on the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the existing arrangements, and collaborates with the government authorities to explore further expansion of market access and facilitation measures for Hong Kong's financial sector in the Mainland market.\nThis translation is very accurate and fluent. It correctly uses \"basic realization of service trade liberalization\" and \"collaborates with the government authorities.\" The phrase \"market access\" is a good choice for \"openness\" in this context, and the sentence structure is clear and natural.\nUnder the framework of the \"Arrangement on Closer Economic Partnership between the Mainland and Hong Kong,\" a new agreement on the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015.

It correctly uses \"Infrastructure\" (from the dictionary) and \"Financing Facilitation\" (from the dictionary). The term \"Office\" is correctly used for \"公室\". The acronym IFFO is properly included in parentheses.\n2. **Translation 2**: \"Infrastructure infrastructure Financing Facilitation office\" – This is incorrect. It repeats \"infrastructure\" unnecessarily and uses \"office\" in lowercase, which is not appropriate for a proper noun. It also fails to use the correct term \"Facilitation office\" from the dictionary.\n3. **Translation 3**: \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" – This is identical to Translation 1 and is correct.\n4. **Translation 4**: \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" – Also identical to Translation 1 and correct.\n5. **Translation 5**: \"# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" – This is correct, but the \"#\" symbol is included, which may be unnecessary unless it is part of the original formatting.\n6. **Translation 6**: \"# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" – Same as Translation 5.\nReasoning for best translation:\nThe best translation should be concise, accurate, and follow proper English formatting. The use of \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" is the most natural and fluent translation. The \"#\" symbol is not necessary unless it is part of the original formatting, which is unclear. Therefore, the best translation is \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\" without the \"#\" symbol.\n\n# IFFO's Mission\n\nIFFO's mission is to bring together key stakeholders to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing. IFFO's functions are:  \n- To provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- To promote market and product development;  \n- And to facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (seventh from the left), joined other guests in toasting at the IFFO launching ceremony.\n\nThe HKMA established IFFO in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operating institutions, professional service companies, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made good progress since its establishment. Dedicated to enhancing skills, IFFO, in October, co-organised a workshop with the International Finance Corporation, under the World Bank Group, and Eastspring Investments, focusing on “investment and financing for private participation in infrastructure projects in emerging markets.” The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, helping to increase knowledge and build networks. IFFO also organised a high-level seminar in November, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to speak and share his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Hub respectively, establishing a cooperation framework. Furthermore, in December, it signed Memorandums of Understanding with the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank respectively, promoting infrastructure project financing for the two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities help strengthen Hong Kong’s position and international image as a hub for infrastructure financing.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Philippe Le Roux, Deputy Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Finance Corporation (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in leveraging the IFFO platform to create a more efficient and conducive market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, Chief Executive Officer of the Global Infrastructure Centre (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework and promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mr. Hu Huaiyong, Chairman of the China Development Bank, to strengthen cooperation between AIIB and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Hub\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is \"# 企業財資中心\", which translates to \"Enterprise Treasury Center\" or similar variations. The dictionary provides several acceptable translations for \"企業\" (companies, enterprises, corporate, etc.) and \"中心\" (centre, hub, center, etc.), with \"財資\" specifically translated as \"treasury.\"\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **\"Corporate Treasury Centre\"** – This is fluent and accurate. \"Corporate\" is a strong choice for \"企業,\" and \"Centre\" is appropriate for \"中心.\" However, \"Centre\" is British English, while the original text uses Traditional Chinese, which is often associated with Hong Kong or Taiwan, where both British and American English are used.\n2. **\"Enterprise Treasury Center\"** – This is also accurate. \"Enterprise\" is a good fit for \"企業,\" and \"Center\" is the American English variant of \"Centre.\" The use of a hashtag (#) matches the original text.\n3. **\"Companies treasury center\"** – This is grammatically correct but less formal. \"Companies\" is a plural noun, which may not be the best fit for \"企業,\" which can be singular or plural depending on context. Also, \"treasury\" is correctly used, but \"center\" is lowercase, which may be inconsistent with the original formatting.\n4. **\"Corporate Treasury Centre\"** – Identical to the first translation, so the same evaluation applies.\n5. **\"Corporate Treasury Center\"** – This is very similar to the first translation, but uses \"Center\" (American English). It is fluent and accurate.\n6. **\"Companies treasury center\"** – Identical to the third translation, so the same evaluation applies.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should balance accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness. \"Enterprise\" is a strong and formal term for \"企業,\" and \"Hub\" is a modern and dynamic synonym for \"中心,\" which may better reflect the function of a \"財資中心\" (treasury center) as a central point of activity or coordination. Additionally, using \"Hub\" can imply a more active and interconnected role, which may be appropriate for a treasury center.\nThe use of a hashtag (#) in the original text should be preserved to maintain consistency with the original formatting. Therefore, the best translation is:\n**# Corporate Treasury Hub**\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with the Government to foster a tax environment conducive to corporate treasury centres. Specifically, the Taxation (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the \"Amended Ordinance\") was passed in June, allowing companies, under specified conditions, to deduct interest expenses incurred in conducting internal financing activities within their operating groups when calculating profits tax, as well as to reduce profits tax by 50% (i.e., down to 8.25%) on profits from specified treasury activities of qualifying corporate treasury centres. Table 2 briefly outlines key points of the Amended Ordinance:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA actively promotes the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland Chinese enterprises. As of year-end, the HKMA has contacted nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organisations. In November, the HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to assist Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong in further understanding and more effectively leveraging our corporate treasury centre platform.\n\n# Promote Asset Management Business\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate. It correctly uses \"asset management centre\" and \"SFC\" as per the dictionary. The only minor issue is the use of \"year-on-year\" which is slightly more formal than necessary, but still acceptable.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also accurate but has a few issues. It uses \"management centre\" instead of \"asset management centre,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"Asia Asset Management Journal\" instead of \"Asian Private Equity Journal,\" which is not in the dictionary and may be a misinterpretation.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"asset management centre\" and \"SFC\" correctly. It also uses \"Asia Venture Capital Journal\" which is a close match to the dictionary entry \"Asian Venture Capital Journal.\" However, it uses \"center\" instead of \"centre\" which is a minor inconsistency.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"asset management centre\" and \"SFC\" correctly. It also uses \"Asia Private Equity Journal\" which is a close match to the dictionary entry. The only minor issue is the use of \"entities\" instead of \"corporations\" which is acceptable but not ideal.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"asset management centre\" and \"SFC\" correctly. It also uses \"Asian Venture Capital Journal\" which is a close match to the dictionary entry. The only minor issue is the use of \"management centre\" instead of \"asset management centre\" in the first sentence.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"asset management centre\" and \"SFC\" correctly. It also uses \"Asia Venture Capital Journal\" which is a close match to the dictionary entry. It is the most consistent with the dictionary and the most fluent.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The best translation should use \"asset management centre\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"SFC\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"Asia Venture Capital Journal\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"established\" or \"set up\" for \"成立\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"overseas\" for \"海外\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"third\" for \"第三\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"institutional investors\" as per the dictionary.\n- It should use \"associated companies\" as per the dictionary.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translators' work, ensuring full adherence to the dictionary and natural English fluency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to promote Hong Kong as an asset management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management stood at 1,300 at the end of 2016, representing an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity fund companies in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed corporations and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of the top 20 mutual fund companies in mainland China, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with operations based in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is the world's third-largest sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office set up outside of Abu Dhabi by the institution.\n\n# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Structure\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is a short title: \"# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\". The goal is to translate it into a natural, fluent English title that accurately reflects the meaning and adheres to the dictionary constraints.\n**Evaluation of Junior Translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** \"Introduce the open-ended fund company structure\" – This is grammatically correct and uses the dictionary terms \"open-ended\" and \"fund.\" However, \"company structure\" may not be the most natural phrasing in this context. The term \"fund company structure\" is more precise, but \"fund structure\" is more commonly used in financial contexts.\n2. **Translation 2:** \"# Introduce open-ended fund company structure\" – This is similar to Translation 1 but includes the hashtag. It is grammatically correct but lacks the article \"the\" and uses \"company structure,\" which is less idiomatic than \"fund structure.\"\n3. **Translation 3:** \"Introducing an open-ended fund company structure.\" – This is grammatically correct and uses the present participle, which is appropriate for a title. However, \"company structure\" is again less idiomatic than \"fund structure.\"\n4. **Translation 4:** \"# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\" – This is well-structured and uses the hashtag, the definite article \"the,\" and capitalizes appropriately. However, \"Fund Company Structure\" is not the most natural phrasing in financial terminology.\n5. **Translation 5:** \"Introducing open-ended fund company structure.\" – This is grammatically correct but lacks the article \"the\" and uses \"company structure,\" which is less idiomatic than \"fund structure.\"\n6. **Translation 6:** \"# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\" – This is identical to Translation 4 and shares the same issues with \"Fund Company Structure.\"\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\n- The term \"基金\" should be translated as \"Fund\" (capitalized in titles) or \"fund\" (lowercase in body text). In this context, \"Fund\" is more appropriate as it is part of a title.\n- \"開放式\" is correctly translated as \"Open-Ended.\"\n- \"公司結構\" should be translated as \"Structure\" rather than \"Company Structure\" or \"Fund Company Structure,\" as \"fund structure\" is the standard term in financial contexts.\n- The use of a hashtag \"#\" is appropriate if the title is intended for a heading or social media post.\n- The definite article \"the\" is appropriate in this context to indicate a specific structure being introduced.\n**Final Translation:**\n# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Structure\n\nTo attract funds to register in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the \"Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016\" was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure, which has diversified Hong Kong's fund registration platform and created a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international asset management centre.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammar, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n1. **Translation 1** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"strive to increase the market's understanding and awareness\" and correctly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"Islamic bonds.\" However, it uses \"the previous two batches\" which is slightly less precise than \"the first two batches\" used in other translations.\n2. **Translation 2** has a grammatical error: \"organising and participate\" is inconsistent in tense and form. It also incorrectly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"sovereign bonds\" instead of \"Islamic bonds.\" Additionally, it uses \"first two tranches\" which is not as precise as \"batches.\"\n3. **Translation 3** is very close to the ideal version. It uses \"organizing and participating\" consistently and correctly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"Islamic bonds.\" It also uses \"previous two batches\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"first two batches.\"\n4. **Translation 4** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"dedicated to increasing market understanding\" and correctly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"Islamic bonds.\" It uses \"first two batches\" which is more precise than \"previous two batches.\"\n5. **Translation 5** is also fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"dedicated to increasing market understanding and awareness\" and correctly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"Islamic bonds.\" It uses \"previous two batches\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"first two batches.\"\n6. **Translation 6** is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"strive to increase market understanding and awareness\" and correctly translates \"蘭債券\" as \"Islamic bonds.\" It uses \"previous two batches\" which is acceptable but slightly less precise than \"first two batches.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be fluent, grammatically correct, and use the most precise terms. It should also use \"first two batches\" instead of \"previous two batches\" for clarity and precision. It should also use \"Islamic bonds\" for \"蘭債券\" as per the dictionary. Based on these considerations, the best translation would combine elements from several translations, particularly Translation 4 and 6, to produce a version that is both accurate and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be dedicated to increasing market understanding and awareness of Islamic finance, including organizing and participating in Islamic finance seminars and lectures in collaboration with industry associations, and sharing experience on issuing Islamic bonds with market participants, encouraging them to use Hong Kong's platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two batches of Islamic bonds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been working closely with the Government to launch the third batch of Islamic bonds when market conditions are appropriate.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

of two terms: \"儲備\" and \"管理.\" According to the dictionary, \"儲備\" should be translated as \"Reserves\" (with a capital R, as it is the most appropriate and natural choice in this context), and \"管理\" should be translated as \"Management\" (with a capital M, as it is a noun and part of a title).\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **\"Reserves Management\"** – This is correct in terms of vocabulary and structure. It uses the proper capitalized terms and follows the dictionary guidelines. However, it lacks the hashtag (#) present in the original text.\n2. **\"# Reserves Management\"** – This translation includes the hashtag, which matches the original format. It also uses the correct terms and capitalization. This is a strong translation.\n3. **\"Reserves Management\"** – Same as the first translation, correct in terms of vocabulary and structure but lacks the hashtag.\n4. **\"# Reserve Management\"** – This translation incorrectly uses \"Reserve\" (singular) instead of \"Reserves\" (plural), which is the correct term according to the dictionary. It also uses lowercase \"management,\" which is not appropriate for a title.\n5. **\"# Reserves Management\"** – This is identical to the second translation and is accurate in both vocabulary and format.\n6. **\"Reserves management\"** – This translation uses the correct terms but fails to capitalize \"Management\" and omits the hashtag.\n### Reasoning for the Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use the correct terms from the dictionary: \"Reserves\" and \"Management.\"\n- Match the original format, which includes a hashtag (#).\n- Capitalize both terms appropriately as they are part of a title.\nBased on this reasoning, the most accurate and well-formatted translation is **\"# Reserves Management.\"**\n\n2016 was a year full of surprises and black swan events, with global financial markets experiencing significant volatility and turbulence. Early in the year, market concerns over a hard landing in the Chinese economy and a slowdown in global growth led to a marked decline in global stock markets. The UK's Brexit referendum in June and the unexpected outcome of the US presidential election in November also caught many by surprise. Despite a difficult investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to enhance the resilience of the Exchange Fund, and as a result, the Exchange Fund still recorded an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Foreign Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Foreign Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre. The Foreign Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary, and is invested in securities or other assets that the Financial Secretary considers appropriate after consulting the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment Targets and Portfolio Composition\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency in translating the original Traditional Chinese text. Here is a critical review of their strengths and weaknesses:\n1. **First Translation**: Uses \"consultation Committee\" instead of \"Advisory Committee,\" which is not the standard term. Also, \"highly circulating\" is not an accurate translation of \"流通性極高的\" (highly liquid). The term \"Monetary\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n2. **Second Translation**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" correctly and \"highly liquid\" accurately. The structure is clear and fluent. However, \"maximize investment returns\" may be too strong compared to the original's \"盡量爭取投資回報\" (to the extent possible, seek investment returns).\n3. **Third Translation**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" and \"highly liquid\" correctly. The structure is clear, but \"achieving investment returns under the premise of complying with items (a) to (c) above\" is slightly wordy and less direct than the original.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: Uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"highly liquid\" correctly. However, \"currency and financial stability\" is less precise than \"monetary and financial stability.\" Also, \"to achieve investment return\" is awkwardly phrased.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" and \"highly liquid\" correctly. The structure is clear and fluent. However, \"strive as much as possible\" is a bit redundant compared to \"to the extent possible.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation**: Uses \"Advisory Committee\" and \"highly liquid\" correctly. The structure is clear and fluent. However, \"ensure capital protection\" is slightly less idiomatic than \"protect capital.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"Advisory Committee\" as the standard term, \"highly liquid\" for \"流通性極高的,\" and \"to the extent possible\" for \"盡量.\" It should also maintain the formal tone of the original and ensure that all dictionary terms are translated accurately.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has formulated the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) To protect capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) To the extent possible, to seek investment returns under the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe original sentence in Traditional Chinese is:  \n**\"以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\"**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"foreign exchange Fund\" and \"statutory purposes\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"The target have already been comprehensively considered\" is grammatically incorrect (subject-verb agreement error). Also, \"the foreign exchange Fund's statutory purposes\" is awkwardly phrased.  \n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"portfolio structure\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"The above targets fully consider\" is slightly off; \"consider\" is not the best fit for \"顧及\" in this context. Also, \"have already been reflected\" is correct, but the sentence is slightly choppy.  \n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"foreign exchange fund\" and \"target asset allocation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Fully take into account\" is better than \"consider,\" but \"the foreign exchange fund\" is repeated unnecessarily.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Exchange Fund\" consistently and \"portfolio structure\" and \"target asset allocation\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Fully take into account\" is good, but the sentence is slightly repetitive with \"Exchange Fund\" repeated.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"foreign exchange fund\" and \"its portfolio structure\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"The above target\" is singular, but the original uses \"目標\" (plural), so \"targets\" is more accurate. Also, \"has already been reflected\" is slightly less natural than \"have already been reflected.\"  \n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"objectives\" for \"目標\" and \"comprehensively take into account\" for \"全面顧及,\" which is accurate.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"The foreign exchange fund\" is repeated unnecessarily, and the sentence could be more concise.  \n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- \"目標\" should be translated as **\"objectives\"** (from the dictionary: \"target,\" \"objectives,\" \"purposes\").\n- \"法定\" should be **\"statutory\"** (from the dictionary: \"statutory,\" \"legal\").\n- \"外匯基金\" should be **\"Exchange Fund\"** (from the dictionary: \"exchange,\" \"foreign exchange,\" \"Exchange\").\n- \"組合結構\" should be **\"portfolio structure\"** (from the dictionary: \"portfolio,\" \"mix,\" \"combination\").\n- \"目標資產分布\" should be **\"target asset allocation\"** (from the dictionary: \"allocation,\" \"distribution\").\n- \"已於...中反映\" should be **\"have already been reflected in\"** (from the dictionary: \"already,\" \"have already,\" \"been\").\nThe best translation should be concise, grammatically correct, and use the most natural phrasing in English while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.\n---\n**Final Translation:**\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators offer varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"monetary base\" and \"target distribution ratio.\" It correctly uses \"US$\" and \"HK$\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"dollar assets\" instead of \"US dollar assets,\" which is slightly less precise.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"Monetary Base\" and \"Cooperation and Development (in OECD)\" as per the dictionary. However, it uses \"member economies\" instead of \"member countries,\" which is slightly off. Also, \"71 to 29\" lacks a percentage sign, which is inconsistent with the original text.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority's system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Bureau system,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"preserve\" instead of \"protect,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term in the context.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and contains some awkward phrasing, such as \"US$ assets with highly liquidity.\" It also uses \"currency issuing system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Bureau system,\" which is not in the dictionary. The term \"Cooperation and Development (in OECD) organization\" is also not in the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"Currency Issuance Authority's system\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Bureau system,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"safeguard\" instead of \"protect,\" which is acceptable but not the most precise term in the context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is accurate and fluent. It uses \"currency issuance regime\" instead of \"Currency Issuance Bureau system,\" which is not in the dictionary. It also uses \"maintain long-term purchasing power\" instead of \"long-term purchasing power,\" which is slightly more verbose than necessary.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"Currency Issuance Bureau system\" should be translated as \"Currency Issuance Bureau system\" as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"Cooperation and Development (in OECD)\" should be used as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"US dollar\" should be used consistently as per the dictionary.\n- The term \"target distribution ratio\" should be used with a percentage sign as in the original text.\n- The term \"protect\" should be used instead of \"preserve\" or \"safeguard\" as it is more precise in the context of asset value.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the Currency Issuance Bureau system. The Investment Portfolio mainly invests in bond markets and stock markets of OECD member countries, to protect the value of assets and maintain long-term purchasing power. The overall target distribution ratio of bonds and stocks for these two portfolios is 71% to 29%. In terms of target currency mix, 91% of assets are allocated to US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term investment returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has adopted a prudent and gradual approach to diversify part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus, but there is still room for the market value cap to increase in response to future fund allocations into long-term assets.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which the Government acquired for strategic purposes under the foreign exchange fund account. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the assessment of the foreign exchange fund's investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio mix. As of the end of 2016, the proportion of the Future Fund in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to about 50%.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe original text discusses the investment procedures of the Exchange Fund, focusing on strategic and tactical asset allocation, benchmarking, and the role of the Financial Secretary and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First Translation:** Uses \"strategic asset allocation\" twice, which is redundant. It also uses \"strategic deviations\" instead of \"tactical deviations\" as per the dictionary. The term \"short-term market sentiments\" is not ideal; \"short-term market fluctuations\" is more standard.\n2. **Second Translation:** Correctly uses \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation. It uses \"strategic deviation\" and \"short-term market movements,\" which are appropriate. However, \"investment objectives\" is slightly less precise than \"investment target\" in the original.\n3. **Third Translation:** Uses \"tactical deviations\" instead of \"strategic deviations,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"HKMA\" without defining it, which may be confusing for some readers.\n4. **Fourth Translation:** Repeats \"strategic asset allocation\" twice, which is redundant. It uses \"strategic deviation\" correctly and \"short-term market fluctuations,\" which is appropriate.\n5. **Fifth Translation:** Uses \"strategic asset distribution\" instead of \"strategic asset allocation,\" which is not ideal. It also uses \"strategic deviations\" instead of \"tactical deviations.\"\n6. **Sixth Translation:** Correctly distinguishes between \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation. It uses \"tactical deviation\" instead of \"strategic deviation,\" which is incorrect. It also uses \"investment objectives\" instead of \"investment target.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Distinguish clearly between \"strategic\" and \"tactical\" asset allocation.\n- Use \"strategic deviation\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"investment target\" instead of \"investment objectives.\"\n- Use \"short-term market fluctuations\" instead of \"short-term market sentiments\" or \"short-term market movements.\"\n- Define \"HKMA\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" on first mention.\n- Ensure that all terms from the dictionary are used correctly.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the distribution indicated by the investment benchmark, shows the best long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment target. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline to implement tactical asset allocation in order to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, following consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and the limits of strategic deviation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation. Investment portfolio managers can hold positions within the limits of strategic deviation to gain from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text is \"# 直接投資,\" which translates to \"# Direct Investment\" in English. The dictionary specifies that the term \"投資\" should be translated as one of the listed alternatives, with \"investment\" being the most appropriate and commonly used term in this context. The translations provided by the junior translators vary in formatting and accuracy.\n- **Translation 1** (\"Direct investment\") is concise but lacks the hashtag, which is present in the original text.\n- **Translation 2** (\"# Direct Investment\") is accurate and maintains the hashtag, making it the most faithful to the original.\n- **Translation 3** (\"#DirectInvestment\") merges the hashtag with the term without a space, which is less standard in English.\n- **Translation 4** (\"# Direct Investment\") is identical to Translation 2 and is also accurate.\n- **Translation 5** (\"Direct Investment\") omits the hashtag, which is part of the original formatting.\n- **Translation 6** (\"investment\") is too brief and omits both the hashtag and the term \"Direct.\"\nThe best translation should retain the hashtag and use \"Direct Investment\" as the standard term for \"直接投資.\" Based on this reasoning, the most accurate and natural translation is \"# Direct Investment.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original Chinese text, but they vary in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary's specified translations. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and grammatically correct. It uses \"foreign exchange fund\" and \"derivatives\" as per the dictionary. However, \"the investment in the foreign exchange fund\" is slightly awkward compared to \"the foreign exchange fund's investments.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This translation is very close to the best possible version. It uses \"about 74%,\" \"global fixed-income markets,\" and \"derivative instruments,\" all of which align with the dictionary. The structure is clear and natural.\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation has some awkward phrasing, such as \"investment of the foreign exchange Fund about 74%,\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"derivatives tools,\" which is not ideal; \"derivative instruments\" is better.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version uses \"Exchange Fund\" and \"supported portfolio,\" which are not the best choices from the dictionary. \"Supported portfolio\" is not listed as an option for \"支持組合,\" which should be \"support portfolio.\" Also, \"derivative instruments\" is correct, but the structure is slightly less fluent than the second translation.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is mostly accurate but uses \"investment portfolios\" instead of \"investment portfolio\" in the second sentence, which is slightly inconsistent. It also uses \"implements\" instead of \"executes,\" which is acceptable but less precise in this context.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This translation is grammatically sound and uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and \"derivative instruments\" correctly. However, the structure \"the macro risk management strategy of the Foreign Exchange Fund is implemented through derivative instruments\" is slightly passive and less direct than the second translation.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- The term \"基金\" should be translated as \"Fund\" with a capital \"F\" when referring to a specific entity like the Exchange Fund.\n- \"支持組合\" should be \"support portfolio.\"\n- \"衍生工具\" should be \"derivative instruments.\"\n- \"執行\" in the context of strategy should be \"execute\" or \"implement.\"\n- \"環球定息市場\" should be \"global fixed-income markets.\"\n- \"宏觀風險管理策略\" should be \"macro risk management strategy.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be a refined version of the second junior translator's work, with minor adjustments for clarity and consistency.\n**Improved Translation**:\nStaff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Reserves Management Department directly manage about 74% of the Exchange Fund's investments, which includes the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio invests in global fixed-income markets and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Managers\nThe original text is \"# 外聘投資經理\". The dictionary provides several options for translating the term \"投資\" (investment), with \"investment\" being the most appropriate and commonly used term in this context. \"經理\" is translated as \"managers\", and \"外\" is translated as \"external\" or \"outside\". The most accurate and natural translation would be \"External Investment Managers\".\nThe translations provided by the junior translators have varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. The first, third, fourth, and fifth translations are the most accurate, using \"External Investment Managers\" with or without the hashtag. However, the second translation, \"External investors\", is incorrect as it misrepresents \"經理\" as \"investors\" instead of \"managers\". The sixth translation, \"External Investment Manager\", is also incorrect as it uses the singular form \"Manager\" instead of the plural \"Managers\".\nConsidering the dictionary and the context, the best translation would be \"External Investment Managers\", which accurately reflects the original text and uses the most appropriate terms from the dictionary.\n\nIn addition to managing assets through in-house personnel, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, and to enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified investment approaches, as well as to allow in-house professionals to gain market knowledge and information.\n\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made in terms of fluency, grammatical accuracy, and consistency with the dictionary terms.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the main components of the expenditure: fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes.\n- The phrase \"subject to market factors\" is consistently used, which aligns with the dictionary entry for \"受\" as \"subject to.\"\n- The use of \"external investment managers\" is consistent with the dictionary entry for \"外\" as \"external.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Grammar and Agreement:** In Translation 6, \"includes\" is used with a plural subject \"expenses,\" which should be \"include.\"\n- **Consistency with Dictionary Terms:** Translation 4 uses \"Fund\" with a capital \"F,\" which may be inconsistent with the dictionary entry for \"基金\" that includes \"fund\" in lowercase.\n- **Fluency and Word Choice:** \"Withheld taxes\" (Translation 2) and \"withholding tax\" (Translation 3 and 6) are both acceptable, but \"withholding taxes\" (Translation 1 and 5) is more precise in the context of multiple taxes.\n- **Use of \"market sentiments\":** Translation 4 uses \"market sentiments,\" which is not the most accurate translation for \"市場\" in this context. \"Market factors\" is more appropriate.\n- **Redundancy and Flow:** Some translations, such as Translation 3, use \"primarily subject to market factors and vary annually,\" which is slightly redundant. A more concise phrasing is preferable.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement.\n- Use \"withholding taxes\" for consistency with the dictionary and clarity.\n- Use \"market factors\" instead of \"market sentiments.\"\n- Maintain lowercase \"fund\" unless it refers to a specific named fund.\n- Use more concise and fluent phrasing to avoid redundancy.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\n**Translation:**\nExpenditure related to employing external investment managers includes fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary each year primarily due to market factors.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This translation is grammatically correct but uses \"support\" instead of \"provide full support\" or \"fully backed\" as per the dictionary. It also uses \"Exchange fund\" instead of \"foreign exchange fund\" or \"Exchange Fund\" (which is a proper noun). The phrase \"externally appointed managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equity portfolio\" is awkwardly phrased.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is the most accurate in terms of dictionary usage, using \"Support\" and \"Fund\" appropriately. However, it uses \"Exchange Fund\" without specifying \"foreign,\" which may be misleading. The phrase \"externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equities portfolios\" is slightly awkward.\n3. **Third Translation**: This translation uses \"HKMA\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" correctly. It also uses \"best approaches\" instead of \"best methods\" or \"best ways,\" which is acceptable. However, the phrase \"externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equity portfolios\" is slightly wordy.\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This translation is fluent and accurate, using \"HKMA\" and \"Exchange Fund\" correctly. It uses \"external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios\" which is concise and natural. It also uses \"best methods\" as per the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This translation is very close to the fourth, with only minor differences in phrasing. It uses \"HKMA\" and \"Exchange Fund\" correctly and \"best methods\" as per the dictionary. It is fluent and natural.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"HKMA\" and \"foreign exchange fund\" correctly. It uses \"external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios\" which is natural. It also uses \"best to fulfill\" which is slightly more natural than \"best methods.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use \"HKMA\" as a proper noun, \"foreign exchange fund\" as per the dictionary, and \"best methods\" or \"best ways\" to reflect the original intent. It should also be concise and natural in English.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" (the \"Principles\") issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on 7 March 2016. The Principles are of a voluntary nature and aim to assist investors in determining the best methods to fulfill their ownership responsibilities regarding investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of the management of the foreign exchange fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing the relevant investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both in-house and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. It also employs risk management tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed analyses of investment performance factors, aiming to most effectively utilize the investment management expertise of both in-house and external investment managers.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2016\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence. In terms of the stock market, concerns in January over a hard landing in the mainland economy and a global growth slowdown led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which stabilized by mid-February. In June, the unexpected outcome of the UK Brexit referendum and in November, the surprising results of the US presidential election followed in succession, but stock markets quickly regained lost ground after experiencing only a brief decline. Overall for the year, global stock markets generally performed well.\n\nIn the bond market, the further decline in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns over global growth moderation and low inflation. Combined with uncertainties arising from the UK Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations of central banks maintaining accommodative policies, this increased demand for safe assets, supporting solid performance in government bond markets during the first half of 2016. In particular, the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, US Treasury bond yields surged due to rising market expectations of US rate hikes, especially after the US presidential election. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the dollar exchange rate index rising to a 14-year high. The sustained strength of the dollar was supported by the widening interest rate differential between the dollar and other major currencies. Although the Japanese yen against the dollar rose about 3% in 2016, the euro against the dollar fell about 3%. Under the ongoing uncertainty caused by the outcome of the Brexit referendum, the British pound against the dollar also fell by 16% during the year, marking the largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Investment Returns. Stock market performance is calculated based on the changes in index prices within the year.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nDespite marked volatility in financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$68.1 billion in 2016, including HK$28.6 billion from overseas equities, HK$5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HK$33.1 billion from bond investments, HK$16.9 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiaries, and a downward adjustment of HK$15.8 billion in the valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets. This downward adjustment was unavoidable as the US dollar exchange rate sharply rose last year, causing the Fund's non-US dollar investments to translate into Hong Kong dollars. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$700 million.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$361.87 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$181.8 billion, including private equity of HK$116.8 billion and real estate of HK$65 billion. The total amount of commitments made but not yet drawn down for investment was HK$133.8 billion.\n\nDespite the ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the Exchange Fund still recorded a 2% investment return rate (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) in 2016. The long-term growth portfolio's annualized internal rate of return has been approximately 12% since the start of investments in 2009.\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines.\n1. **Use of \"Exchange Fund\" vs. \"foreign exchange fund\":** The term \"外匯基金\" is best translated as \"Exchange Fund\" (capitalized), as it refers to a specific entity, likely the Hong Kong Exchange Fund. The use of \"foreign exchange fund\" is less precise and more generic.\n2. **\"Still recorded\" vs. \"achieved\":** While both are grammatically correct, \"recorded\" is more formal and aligns better with financial reporting language, which is appropriate for the context.\n3. **\"Annualized internal rate of return\":** This is the correct and standard financial term. Some translations use \"in-house return rate,\" which is incorrect and not aligned with the dictionary's \"internal\" → \"internal\" or \"in-house.\"\n4. **\"Since the start of investments\" vs. \"since the commencement of investment activities\":** The former is more concise and natural in English financial writing.\n5. **\"Approximately\" vs. \"about\":** Both are acceptable, but \"approximately\" is more formal and commonly used in financial contexts.\n6. **\"Strategic asset portfolio\" vs. \"strategic asset portfolios\":** The original text uses the singular \"策略性資產組合,\" so the correct translation is \"strategic asset portfolio.\"\n7. **Punctuation and structure:** Some translations lack proper punctuation or use awkward phrasing, such as \"since investment began in 2009, is approximately 12%,\" which disrupts the flow.\nBased on these observations, the best possible translation would use \"Exchange Fund,\" \"recorded,\" \"annualized internal rate of return,\" and \"approximately,\" while maintaining a clear and concise structure.\n---\nDespite the ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the Exchange Fund still recorded a 2% investment return rate (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) in 2016. The long-term growth portfolio's annualized internal rate of return has been approximately 12% since the start of investments in 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years, including shortening the duration of the bond portfolio, increasing cash holdings, and markedly reducing non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversification in our investments, especially in long-term growth portfolios. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 shows the investment return rate of the Exchange Fund in 2016 and the average investment return rate for different durations. The average return rate of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.8%. Table 3 lists the currency mix of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFigure 1: Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate (1994 to 2016)\n\n1.

加強監理能力，以管理銀行日益增加的科技風險及新的金融科技項目，以及應對銀行在區內及業務上的擴展；\n    - 加強打擊清洗黑錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的監管及執法工作，並為2018年打擊清洗黑錢財務特別行動組織相互評估計劃作好準備；\n    - 作好實施《金融機構（處置機制）條例》的規劃及籌備工作，以根據國際標準處理金融業「大到不能倒」的問題；及\n    - 加強監理能力以配合有關資本及市場風險的新國際標準，並增撥資源處理消費者保障事宜及銀行投訴。\n- 因應進一步推動外匯基金投資產品多元化所牽涉的更多投資工作，加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支援，同時強化策略性資產分配及投資程序，以應對挑戰日增的投資環境。\n- 制定及實施人才發展計劃，並加強相關資源，確保金管局具備所需的人力資源應對市場發展及未來的挑戰。\n- 加強貨幣政策方面的研究及貨幣統計資料的處理，以及提供資源處理就儲值支付工具及零售支付系統的牌照╱指定及相關監管事宜而作出的查詢及投訴。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n表1 2017年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n金管局調配臨時資源以應付其他工作，並借調員工至國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）及金融發展局，為香港或金管局有份參與的工作或政策提供協助。此外，金管局派調員工到香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會，以提供全職或協助性質的運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會提供的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬或發放浮動薪酬的款項；而用於專業投資人員的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁或以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2016年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。高級助理總裁職級人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁在內。3. 其他福利包括公積金、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising in","leveraging on","advance","promote","further"],"議題":["subjects","issues"],"支援":["support","technical support"],"體系":["system","banking system","sector"],"「":["“","\""],"已舉":["have been organised"],"預期":["expectation","expected","anticipate","forecasts","projects"],"並與":["and","and"],"啟動":["triggered","launch","initiation","launching"],"信貸":["credit"],"港":["Hong Kong"],"升至":["rose to","increased to","climbed to","edged up to","picked up to"],"為":["for","to","as","to help cope","foster","promote","to be","to render by","tobe","at","of","be","become"],"科技":["technology","fintech","Fintech","technological","tech","It"],"建":["developed","build","carry out","built","establish","established"],"多項":["several","multiple"],"多家":["several","several"],"人才":["talent","talent"],"近年":["over the years","in recent years","recent years"],"12":["12","December","twelve"],"重點":["priorities","highlights","key","major"],"特別":["especially","special"],"針對":["aimed at","in combating","with regard to"],"放程序":["the payout process","requirements and procedures"],"牆":["barriers"],"德霖":["Norman T.L.","Norman Chan"],"人民":["renminbi","Renminbi","RMB"],"流動":["liquidity","fund flows","mobile","liquid"],"價格":["prices"],"之稱":["known as"],"金融":["financial","finance","fintech","Fintech","Finance"],"紛紛":["several","several"],"培訓":["talent development","personnel training","training"],"銀行":["banks","banking","bank","banks’"],"申請":["applications","application","apply"],"微升":["a slight increase"],"上":["in","on","upwards"],"令美股":["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the term \"HKMA\" for \"金管局\" and \"public understanding\" for \"增進公眾了解.\"\n- The phrase \"supporting professional development of staff\" is consistently used for \"推動員工提升專業能力,\" which is an accurate and natural translation.\n- The term \"instituting rigorous financial discipline\" is used for \"嚴格控制財政,\" which aligns with the dictionary and is contextually appropriate.\n- The use of \"information technology security\" for \"資訊科技保安\" is accurate and natural.\n- The phrase \"to help cope with the challenges brought by...\" is used effectively in several translations to convey \"以應付...帶來的挑戰.\"\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some translations use \"corporate governance\" for \"機構管治,\" which is acceptable but \"institutional governance\" is more precise and aligns better with the dictionary's \"governance\" and \"corporate governance.\"\n- The term \"Fintech\" is used in one translation for \"資訊科技,\" which is not appropriate in this context; \"information technology\" is more accurate.\n- The phrase \"increasingly complex work\" is used in some translations, but \"increasing complexity of work\" is more natural.\n- The use of \"communications\" instead of \"communication\" is grammatically correct but less common in formal writing.\n- The phrase \"This year\" is used in some translations, but \"During the year\" is more consistent with the original text's tone.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"institutional governance\" for \"機構管治.\"\n- Use \"information technology\" for \"資訊科技.\"\n- Use \"increasing complexity of work\" for \"日益繁重的工作.\"\n- Use \"enhancing\" or \"enhance\" for \"增進.\"\n- Use \"to help cope with\" for \"以應付.\"\n- Maintain a formal and professional tone consistent with the original text.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and markets through media, public education activities, and other various channels, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security, to help cope with the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# Maintaining contact with the public and institutional development\nThe original phrase \"與公眾保持聯繫機構發展\" is a concise title or heading, likely from a report or policy document. The key terms to translate are \"與公眾保持聯繫\" (maintaining contact with the public) and \"機構發展\" (institutional development). The dictionary provides several options for each term, and the translations by junior translators vary in fluency and accuracy.\nTranslation 1: \"Institutional Development Maintaining Contact with the Public\" – This is grammatically correct but awkward in structure. It places \"Institutional Development\" at the beginning, which may confuse the reader about the relationship between the two parts of the phrase.\nTranslation 2: \"Linked with public institutions development\" – This is grammatically incorrect and unclear. The phrase \"linked with public institutions development\" is not a standard expression and fails to convey the intended meaning.\nTranslation 3: \"Institutional Development in Maintaining Contact with the Public\" – This is grammatically correct but again places \"Institutional Development\" at the beginning, which may not be the most natural way to express the relationship between the two parts.\nTranslation 4: \"Maintaining Links with the Public and Institutional Development\" – This is a clear and natural translation. It uses \"Maintaining Links\" for \"與公眾保持聯繫\" and \"Institutional Development\" for \"機構發展,\" which are both accurate and natural in English.\nTranslation 5: \"# Keeping in Touch with the Public and Institutional Development\" – This is a good translation, with the only minor issue being the unnecessary hashtag at the beginning, which may be a formatting error.\nTranslation 6: \"Maintaining contact with the public and the development of institutions.\" – This is also a good translation, using \"Maintaining contact\" for \"與公眾保持聯繫\" and \"the development of institutions\" for \"機構發展.\" It is slightly more wordy than Translation 4 but still accurate and natural.\nBased on the above analysis, the best possible translation would be a version that clearly conveys the relationship between maintaining contact with the public and institutional development, using natural and fluent English. The phrase \"Maintaining contact with the public and institutional development\" is concise, accurate, and natural, making it the best choice.\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, terminology consistency, and stylistic choices that affect the overall quality of the translations.\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly use the dictionary terms, such as \"傳媒\" as \"media,\" \"即場\" as \"stand-up,\" and \"次\" as \"times.\"\n- The structure of the sentences is largely consistent with the original, and the key numerical data (e.g., 81, 14, 13, 54, 30, 326) are accurately represented.\n- The use of \"facilitate public understanding\" and \"enhance transparency\" is consistent across translations and aligns well with the original intent.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Terminology Inconsistency:** Some translations use \"HKMA\" while others use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" For consistency, the full name should be used on first mention, followed by the acronym.\n- **Fluency and Style:** Some translations use \"public media events\" or \"public media programmes,\" which are acceptable but not as precise as \"public media activities\" or \"public activities.\"\n- **Redundancy and Wordiness:** The fourth translation uses \"arrangements were made for 30 media interviews,\" which is more passive and less direct than \"arranged 30 media interviews.\"\n- **Tense and Clarity:** The fourth translation uses \"are handled daily,\" which is grammatically correct but less consistent with the past tense used elsewhere in the text.\n**Improvements:**\n- Use the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" on first mention, followed by \"HKMA\" in subsequent references.\n- Use \"public media activities\" or \"public activities\" consistently, as these terms are more aligned with the original Chinese.\n- Maintain a consistent tense (past tense) throughout the translation, as the text refers to events that occurred in 2016.\n- Use active voice where possible for clarity and fluency.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close links with the media to enhance its transparency and facilitate public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 81 public media activities, including 14 press conferences, 13 stand-up interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were published, and a large number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established two important offices, namely the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain the functions and work plans of both offices, the HKMA carried out several public communication initiatives. In addition, the HKMA organized media briefings and seminars to enhance the public's understanding of the HKMA's operations and measures in multiple areas, including financial inclusion, reserves management, fintech regulatory sandbox, cybersecurity, and SME financing.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, met with journalists during the Hong Kong Banking Association's annual trip to Beijing in December 2016.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n# 公眾查詢\nThe original text is a heading, likely for a section or page on a website or official document. The term \"公眾\" translates to \"public,\" and \"查詢\" can be translated as either \"enquiries\" or \"enquiry.\" The junior translators have produced several versions of the translation, with the most common being \"Public Enquiries\" and \"Public enquiries.\" The difference between \"enquiries\" and \"enquiry\" lies in the British vs. American English usage, with \"enquiries\" being the plural form more commonly used in British English, while \"enquiry\" is often used in American English as both singular and plural.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are mostly accurate and appropriate for the context. However, the use of the hashtag \"#\" in translations 4 and 5 is unnecessary unless the original text included it for formatting purposes. Since the original text does not include a hashtag, it should not be added in the translation.\nThe best possible translation would be \"Public Enquiries,\" as it is the most natural and commonly used form in English for headings or titles related to public services or information. It is also consistent with the dictionary's suggested translations for \"查詢\" and \"公眾.\" The use of \"Enquiries\" with a capital \"E\" is appropriate as it is the beginning of the heading.\nTherefore, the improved translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English is \"Public Enquiries.\"\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the core message of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"stored value payment tools\" and \"prudential regulatory measures.\" However, it uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" without abbreviation (HKMA), which may be inconsistent with official usage.\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. It uses \"Coin Collection Programme\" and \"anti-money laundering and financing of terrorist activities,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"work-related information\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"work information.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"members of the public\" and \"stored value payment facilities,\" which are appropriate. However, it uses \"banking policies and regulations\" instead of \"banking sector policies and regulations,\" which is slightly less precise.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is fluent and accurate, with natural phrasing. It uses \"counter-terrorism financing activities\" and \"prudent regulatory measures for property mortgage loans,\" which are appropriate. It also uses \"coin collection programs\" and \"stored value payment facilities,\" which are consistent with the dictionary.\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is accurate but slightly less fluent. It uses \"HKMA’s Functions\" with a capital \"F,\" which is inconsistent with the dictionary. It also uses \"banking industry related guidance\" instead of \"banking-related guidance,\" which is slightly awkward.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version has several issues. It incorrectly states \"Members of the public enquiry service is a channel...\" which is grammatically incorrect. It also uses \"Monetary and economy matters\" instead of \"monetary and economic matters,\" and \"fund-raising activities for terrorists\" instead of \"financing of terrorist activities,\" which is less precise.\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- Use \"HKMA\" as the standard abbreviation for \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"\n- Ensure consistency in terms like \"coin collection programme\" and \"stored value payment facilities.\"\n- Use \"anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities\" for clarity and precision.\n- Maintain a natural flow and avoid awkward phrasing like \"work-related information.\"\n- Ensure all dictionary terms are used correctly, such as \"regulation\" for \"規例\" and \"prudent regulatory measures\" for \"審慎監管措施.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for members of the public to enquire about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s functions and work information. This service handled 10,170 enquiries in 2016, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. Approximately half of the enquiries related to banking sector policies and regulations, monetary and economic matters, and banking consumer issues, especially banking products and services, the coin collection programme, banking-related guidance and notices, stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, and prudent regulatory measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public enquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion accounted for by various types of enquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year. It regularly updated the data in the Monthly Financial Statistics Report, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 \"Exchange Thoughts\" articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 articles in 2015, elaborating on a number of thematic issues related to the HKMA's work.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**金管局《二零一五年年報》在香港管理專業協會2016年度最佳年報評選中獲得「非牟利及慈善機構」類銀獎。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **First junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Silver award\" and \"non-profit and charitable institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Incorrectly states \"Annual Report 2016\" instead of \"2015.\" Also, \"Best Annual Report Awards 2016\" is not an exact match for the original. The phrase \"organized by the Hong Kong Management Association\" is not directly supported by the original text.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Management Association\" is not the exact match for \"管理專業協會\" (Management Professional Association).\n2. **Second junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"non-profit and charitable institutions\" and \"Silver award.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Management Professional Association\" which is accurate, but the structure is slightly awkward. Also, \"selection\" is not the best term for \"評選\" (selection\/competition).  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Management Professional Association\" is appropriate.\n3. **Third junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Silver award\" and \"non-profit and charitable institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Best Annual Report Awards 2016\" which is not the exact term in the original. Also, \"Hong Kong Management Association\" is not the exact name of the organization.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Management Association\" is not the exact match for \"管理專業協會.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Silver Award\" and \"Non-profit and Charitable Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Competition\" instead of \"Selection\" or \"Award.\" Also, \"Hong Kong Management Association\" is not the exact name of the organization.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Management Association\" is not the exact match for \"管理專業協會.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Silver award\" and \"non-profit and charitable institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Selection\" which is not the best term for \"評選.\" Also, \"Hong Kong Management Association\" is not the exact name of the organization.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Management Association\" is not the exact match for \"管理專業協會.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**:  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly identifies \"Silver Award\" and \"Non-profit and Charitable Institutions.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Uses \"Hong Kong Institute of Management\" which is not the exact name of the organization. Also, \"Best Annual Report Awards 2016\" is not the exact term in the original.  \n   - **Cultural Appropriateness**: The term \"Institute of Management\" is not the exact match for \"管理專業協會.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- The original text clearly states that the **HKMA's 2015 Annual Report** received a **Silver award** in the **\"non-profit and charitable institutions\"** category in the **2016 Best Annual Report Selection** organized by the **Hong Kong Management Professional Association**.\n- The term **「非牟利及慈善機構」** should be translated as **\"non-profit and charitable institutions\"**.\n- The term **「類銀獎」** should be translated as **\"Silver award\"**.\n- The term **「管理專業協會」** should be translated as **\"Hong Kong Management Professional Association\"**.\n- The term **「年報」** should be translated as **\"Annual Report\"**.\n- The term **「獲」** should be translated as **\"received\"**.\n- The term **「機構」** should be translated as **\"institutions\"**.\n- The term **「年度」** should be translated as **\"annual\"**.\n- The term **「年」** should be translated as **\"year\"**.\n- The term **「最佳」** should be translated as **\"best\"**.\n- The term **「評選」** should be translated as **\"selection\"**.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's \"Annual Report 2015\" received the \"Silver award\" in the \"non-profit and charitable institutions\" category in the 2016 Best Annual Report Selection organized by the Hong Kong Management Professional Association.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2, introducing the public to the HKMA's work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking affairs. The Information Centre consists of two parts: an exhibition hall and a library, which are open to the public for visits six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work, as well as the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core message of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, vocabulary choice, and adherence to the dictionary constraints. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: The translation is fluent and accurate, with a natural flow. It correctly uses \"Policy Exhibition Area\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\" However, it uses \"led to\" for \"令\" in \"令展覽內容更豐富\" which is slightly less precise than \"enriched\" or \"enhanced.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"renovation project\" which is slightly more formal than necessary. It correctly uses \"Victoria Harbour\" and \"mosaic artwork.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is slightly less fluent, with awkward phrasing such as \"blending learning with play\" and \"a Harbour view.\" It also uses \"already reopened\" which is not the best fit for the original text.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This version is concise but lacks some of the richness of the original. It uses \"policy exhibitions\" instead of \"policy exhibition area,\" which is not as precise. It also omits \"the\" before \"Victoria Harbour.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is very accurate and fluent. It uses \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" which is appropriate. It correctly uses \"clearly and simply explaining\" and \"view of Victoria Harbour.\" However, it uses \"revamped\" which is not in the dictionary.\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is accurate and fluent. It uses \"combine learning with fun\" which is slightly less formal than \"learning through play.\" It also correctly uses \"Victoria Harbour\" and \"reopened.\"\n**Reasoning for improvements**:\n- The term \"資訊中心\" should be translated as \"Information Centre\" (capitalized as per the dictionary).\n- \"互動\" should be translated as \"interactions\" as per the dictionary.\n- \"維港\" should be \"Victoria Harbour.\"\n- \"賽克\" should be \"mosaic.\"\n- \"為訪客帶來全新的參觀體驗\" should be translated as \"aiming to bring visitors a completely new visiting experience.\"\n- \"13萬枚香港硬幣\" should be \"over 130,000 Hong Kong coins.\"\n- \"重新開放\" should be \"reopened.\"\nBased on these considerations, the best possible translation would be a synthesis of the most accurate and fluent elements from the junior translators' work, ensuring adherence to the dictionary and natural English expression.\nThe final translation is as follows:\nThe Policy Exhibition Area of the Information Centre, which explains the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation in the fourth quarter of 2016. This enhanced the exhibition content and added various interactive elements, especially interactive games that combine learning with play, clearly and simply explaining financial concepts. It also features touch-screen displays with rich illustrations, providing a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, aiming to bring visitors a completely new visiting experience. In addition, the renovated Information Centre now features a mosaic artwork made of over 130,000 Hong Kong coins depicting the view of Victoria Harbour. The newly renovated Policy Exhibition Area was reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Translation 1** is generally accurate and fluent, with appropriate use of terms from the dictionary. It correctly uses \"maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance\" and \"stored value payment facilities.\" However, it uses \"facilitating the public's access\" which is slightly awkward compared to \"facilitating public access.\"\n**Translation 2** is very close to the ideal version. It uses \"facilitating public access to the latest updates from the Authority\" and correctly translates \"maintained under Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\" It also uses \"cash collection vehicles\" for \"收銀車,\" which is more natural than \"collection vehicles.\" However, it uses \"cash collection vehicles\" instead of \"coin collection program collection vehicles,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Translation 3** has several errors. It incorrectly translates \"備存\" as \"maintained under the banking Ordinance Article 2\" instead of \"Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\" It also uses \"location parked (of vehicles)\" which is awkward and incorrect. Additionally, it uses \"data\" instead of \"information\" for \"資料,\" which is not ideal in this context.\n**Translation 4** is accurate and fluent. It uses \"maintained in accordance with Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance\" and \"stored value payment tools\" correctly. It also uses \"parking locations of cash collection vehicles for the coin collection program,\" which is natural and precise.\n**Translation 5** is very similar to Translation 4, with the exception of using \"licensed institution\" instead of \"authorised institution,\" which is acceptable but less common in official HKMA contexts. It also uses \"cash-in vehicles\" instead of \"cash collection vehicles,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Translation 6** has some issues with capitalization and punctuation, such as \"banking Ordinance\" and \"Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance\" should be in title case. It also uses \"cashiers\" instead of \"collection vehicles,\" which is incorrect.\n**Best Possible Translation:**\nBased on the above review, the best possible translation would combine the strengths of the most accurate and fluent translations, ensuring that all dictionary terms are correctly used and that the language is natural and precise.\nThe final translation should:\n- Use \"maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance\"\n- Use \"stored value payment facilities\" or \"stored value payment tools\"\n- Use \"cash collection vehicles\" for \"收銀車\"\n- Use \"facilitating public access to the latest information\"\n- Ensure proper capitalization and punctuation for legal terms\nHere is the improved translation:\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and both simplified and traditional Chinese, facilitating public access to the HKMA's latest information. The website also contains the \"Register of Employees of Authorised Institutions Engaged in Securities Business\" and the \"Register of Authorised Institutions and Their Local Representatives' Offices,\" which are maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensees of Stored Value Payment Facilities,\" maintained in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Facilities Ordinance. The website features thematic webpages and prominent quick links to remind the public of the HKMA's new measures, such as the regulatory regime for stored value payment facilities, IFFO and FFO, as well as important and timely matters, such as being vigilant against telephone fraud and the parking locations of cash collection vehicles for the coin collection program.\n\nThe original text, \"資訊中心政策展區的全新形象,\" translates to \"The completely new image of the information centre's policy exhibition area.\" The junior translators have produced several versions, each with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** \"The completely new image of the information center’s policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"completely new\" for \"全新,\" and proper structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Center\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's a proper noun.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"資訊\" → \"information,\" \"中心\" → \"center,\" \"政策\" → \"policy,\" \"全新\" → \"completely new.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** \"The completely new image of the information centre policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"completely new\" and \"information centre.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing possessive apostrophe after \"information centre.\"  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n3. **Third junior translator:** \"The completely new image of the information center's policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of possessive apostrophe and \"completely new.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Center\" is capitalized unnecessarily.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** \"The information center’s completely new policies exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of possessive apostrophe.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Misinterpretation of \"政策\" as \"policies\" instead of \"policy,\" and \"展區\" is translated as \"exhibition area\" but the structure is awkward.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** \"資訊\" → \"information,\" \"中心\" → \"center,\" \"政策\" → \"policies\" (incorrect), \"全新\" → \"completely new.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** \"The completely new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"completely new,\" \"Information Centre,\" and possessive apostrophe.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Information Centre\" is capitalized unnecessarily unless it's a proper noun.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** \"The completely new image of the information centre policy exhibition area.\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correct use of \"completely new\" and \"information centre.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Missing possessive apostrophe.  \n   - **Dictionary compliance:** All terms are correctly translated.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"information centre\" (lowercase unless it's a proper noun), include the possessive apostrophe, and use \"policy\" rather than \"policies\" since \"政策\" refers to a singular concept in this context. The phrase \"exhibition area\" is appropriate for \"展區.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe completely new image of the information centre's policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic artwork created using Hong Kong coins to depict the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tour services for visitors. Within the year, the Information Centre received over 56,200 visitors and provided guided tour services over 580 times for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the cumulative total number of visitors received by the Information Centre has exceeded 586,600.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on subjects such as Hong Kong currency, the banking sector, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains an electronic register of employees engaged in securities business at authorized institutions and local representative offices, as stipulated in Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA continues to organize public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three open seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers, with topics including the linked exchange rate system, banking system stability, Hong Kong banknotes, smart tips on using banking-related products and services, and the deposit protection scheme. Since their introduction in 1998, the education seminars have attracted over 56,400 members of the public.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in various districts attended one of the public education seminars.\nThe translations provided by the junior translators are generally accurate but vary in fluency and precision. The first translation uses \"various secondary schools\" which is correct but slightly less specific than \"various districts.\" The second and third translations use \"schools in various districts\" and \"district high schools,\" respectively, which are both acceptable but may not fully capture the nuance of \"中學\" (secondary school). The fourth translation omits \"secondary schools\" entirely, which is a critical piece of information. The fifth and sixth translations are identical and correctly use \"secondary schools in various districts\" and \"public education seminars,\" which aligns well with the dictionary terms provided.\nThe best translation should accurately reflect the original text's meaning, use appropriate terminology from the dictionary, and maintain fluency and naturalness in English. The phrase \"public education seminars\" is the most accurate use of the dictionary terms \"公眾\" and \"講座.\" The term \"secondary schools\" is more precise than \"high schools\" in this context, as \"中學\" typically refers to secondary education in the Chinese context. Therefore, the most accurate and fluent translation is: \"Students and teachers from secondary schools in various districts attended one of the public education seminars.\"\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016\nThe original title, \"圖3 2016年到訪資訊中心的團體類別,\" translates to \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with its own merits and drawbacks.\nThe first translation, \"Figure 3 Group categories visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is grammatically correct but lacks punctuation, which can make it appear less formal or structured. The second translation, \"Figure 3 groups visiting the information center in 2016,\" omits the word \"categories\" and uses lowercase for \"information center,\" which may not be appropriate for a formal title. The third translation, \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is well-structured, with proper punctuation and capitalization, and accurately reflects the original meaning. The fourth translation, \"Figure 3: Categories of groups that visited the Information Centre in 2016,\" is slightly more wordy due to the use of \"that visited,\" which is not necessary in a title. The fifth translation, \"Figure 3 Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016,\" is similar to the third but lacks the colon after \"Figure 3,\" which is standard in formal titles. The sixth translation, \"Figure 3: Group categories visiting the information center in 2016,\" is close but uses lowercase for \"information center\" and \"group categories,\" which may not be ideal for a formal title.\nConsidering these observations, the best possible translation would be one that maintains the structure and formality of the original title while ensuring proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. The third and fifth translations are the closest to this ideal, with the third being slightly more polished due to the inclusion of the colon after \"Figure 3.\" Therefore, the best possible translation would be \"Figure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016.\"\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary guidelines. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify and translate the key terms from the dictionary, such as \"靈活\" as \"flexible,\" \"應付\" as \"address\" or \"meet,\" \"組織\" as \"organizational,\" and \"人才\" as \"talent.\"\n- Most translations maintain the core meaning of the original text, particularly in conveying the HKMA’s role in policy implementation, staffing, and organizational efficiency.\n- The use of \"HKMA\" is consistent across translations, which is appropriate given the context.\n- The structure of the sentences is generally clear and follows a logical flow.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** uses \"fulfill policy targets\" instead of \"policy objectives\" or \"policy goals,\" which is slightly less natural. It also uses \"staff\" instead of \"workforce\" or \"team,\" which is acceptable but less precise.\n- **Translation 2** is fluent and accurate, using \"non-civil service terms\" correctly and \"strives to implement new measures and cope with the increasing workload.\" However, it uses \"talents\" instead of \"talent,\" which is grammatically incorrect.\n- **Translation 3** is concise and accurate, using \"respond to\" instead of \"address\" or \"meet,\" which is appropriate. However, it omits \"as far as possible\" in the last sentence, slightly weakening the nuance.\n- **Translation 4** is the most comprehensive, using \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" fully, which is more formal and appropriate for official documents. It also uses \"individuals\" instead of \"talent,\" which is more inclusive but slightly less aligned with the dictionary.\n- **Translation 5** uses \"key priorities\" instead of \"work priorities,\" which is slightly off. It also uses \"staff staffing\" in the last sentence, which is awkward and redundant.\n- **Translation 6** is very close to the best version, using \"implement policy objectives\" and \"as far as possible,\" but it omits \"dedicated to\" and uses \"copes with\" instead of \"address.\"\n**Reasoning for Improvement:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"HKMA\" with its full name on first mention.\n- Use \"policy objectives\" or \"policy goals\" instead of \"policy targets.\"\n- Use \"workforce\" or \"staff\" consistently.\n- Use \"non-civil service terms\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"as far as possible\" to reflect the nuance of \"盡可能.\"\n- Use \"address\" or \"cope with\" for \"應付.\"\n- Avoid grammatical errors such as \"talents\" instead of \"talent.\"\n- Ensure clarity and fluency in sentence structure.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employs, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work priorities. As part of the government structure, the HKMA hires staff under non-civil service terms, attracting talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined and flexible organizational structure, and as far as possible, implements new measures and addresses increasing workloads by allocating existing staff.\n\n# Staffing Structure\n\nThe original text provides a factual statement about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) staffing changes in 2016, specifically the increase in positions to fulfill regulatory functions under a new insurance regulatory regime. The junior translators have produced translations that are mostly accurate but vary in fluency, clarity, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** The translation is clear and accurate, using \"staffing establishment\" consistently and correctly translating \"履行\" as \"fulfill.\" However, \"early in 2016\" is slightly redundant with \"in the second half of 2016.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** This translation is very similar to the first, but the phrase \"in early in the year 2016\" is awkward and repetitive. It also uses \"perform\" instead of \"fulfill,\" which is slightly less precise in this context.\n3. **Third junior translator:** This translation is concise and fluent. It uses \"HKMA\" consistently and translates \"履行\" as \"fulfill,\" which is appropriate. However, \"insurance industry regulatory regime\" is slightly more wordy than necessary.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** This translation uses \"supervisory authority\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is not ideal as it lacks specificity. It also uses \"Functions\" with a capital \"F,\" which is unnecessary unless it refers to a specific document or title.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and fluent, using \"discharge\" for \"履行,\" which is a strong and appropriate term. It also uses \"persons\" instead of \"people,\" which is acceptable but slightly more formal.\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** This translation is accurate and uses \"established\" for \"設,\" which is correct. However, \"insurance regulatory system\" is less precise than \"regulatory regime\" or \"regulatory regime.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should be concise, fluent, and use the most appropriate terms from the dictionary. It should also maintain the specificity of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" and use \"fulfill\" or \"discharge\" for \"履行.\" The term \"regulatory regime\" is more precise than \"system\" or \"arrangement.\" \"Staffing establishment\" is the best choice for \"編制\" or \"人手.\"\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's staffing establishment was 875 people at the beginning of 2016. In the second half of 2016, 12 positions were added to fulfill the HKMA's supervisory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Therefore, the HKMA's staffing establishment was 887 people at the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot trials, and managing increasingly complex and demanding tasks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) increased its overall staffing by 40 personnel to 927 (an increase of 4.5%) in 2017. The newly created positions are responsible for the following functions:  \n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:  \n    - Strengthening supervisory capabilities to manage banks’ increasing technology risks and new fintech initiatives, as well as responding to banks’ expansion within the region and in their business operations;  \n    - Strengthening regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the mutual evaluation program under the 2018 Special Anti-Money Laundering Financial Action;  \n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance to address the “too big to fail” issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and  \n    - Strengthening supervisory capabilities to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, while allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.  \n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and related support in response to the increased investment activities involved in further promoting the diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, while reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to cope with increasingly challenging investment environments.  \n- Developing and implementing talent development programs and enhancing related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to address market developments and future challenges.  \n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle inquiries and complaints regarding licensing\/designation and related regulatory matters concerning stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing structure and actual number of personnel of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) by department.  \nTable 1: HKMA Staffing Structure and Actual Number of Personnel as of 1 January 2017.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First junior translator**: This translation is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"reallocate temporary resources\" and \"deployed staff.\" It correctly uses \"assist in work or policies related to Hong Kong or the HKMA.\" However, \"operational assistance\" is slightly less precise than \"operational support.\"\n2. **Second junior translator**: This version is also fluent and accurate. It uses \"second staff\" (a term that is acceptable in this context) and \"provide support for work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved.\" The use of \"Treasury Markets Association\" is slightly off, as the original text refers to \"財資市場公會,\" which should be \"Treasury Markets Association\" or \"Financial and Treasury Markets Association.\"\n3. **Third junior translator**: This translation is less fluent and contains some awkward phrasing, such as \"assist in projects or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA participated.\" The use of \"participated\" is incorrect in this context, as the original text refers to ongoing involvement, not past participation. Also, \"assist in operation support\" is grammatically incorrect.\n4. **Fourth junior translator**: This is a strong translation with accurate use of terms like \"reallocate temporary resources\" and \"provide assistance for work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved.\" The only minor issue is the use of \"Treasury and Markets Association,\" which may not be the most precise term for \"財資市場公會.\"\n5. **Fifth junior translator**: This translation is fluent but has some grammatical issues, such as \"support nature operational assistance,\" which is awkward. Also, \"Financial and Treasury Market Association\" is not the best match for \"財資市場公會.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator**: This version is somewhat awkward, with phrases like \"assist in nature operation support\" and \"Deposit Insurance Committee\" (which should be \"Deposit Protection Committee\"). The use of \"employees\" instead of \"staff\" is not incorrect but less consistent with the original text.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation**:\n- Use \"reallocate temporary resources\" as it is the most natural and accurate phrasing.\n- Use \"deploy staff\" consistently, as it is the most appropriate term for \"調員.\"\n- Use \"assist in work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved\" to reflect the original meaning accurately.\n- Use \"Treasury Markets Association\" for \"財資市場公會.\"\n- Use \"operational support\" for \"運作支援.\"\n- Ensure that all dictionary terms are used correctly, such as \"Fund\" for \"基金\" and \"Committee\" for \"委員會.\"\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe HKMA reallocates temporary resources to help cope with other tasks and deploys staff to international or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA deploys staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or supportive operational assistance.\n\n# Remuneration and Benefits Policies and Remuneration Review System\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) of the Treasury, through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, listens to the advice provided by the governance committees under his jurisdiction, and considers market remuneration levels and practices to determine the remuneration and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees. The remuneration package includes cash remuneration and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash remuneration includes a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable salary paid once a year based on employee performance.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators all convey the general meaning of the original text, but they vary in fluency, accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review of each:\n1. **First Translation**: This version is fluent and accurate, with proper use of terms like \"Financial Secretary\" and \"remuneration.\" However, it uses \"corporate governance committee\" instead of \"governance committee,\" which is not the exact term in the dictionary. It also uses \"listening to the proposals\" which is slightly awkward.\n2. **Second Translation**: This is concise and accurate, using \"Financial Secretary\" and \"governance committee\" correctly. However, it omits \"through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and instead says \"seeking advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is slightly less precise than the original.\n3. **Third Translation**: This version is accurate and uses \"Governance Committee\" correctly. It also includes \"HKMA\" as an abbreviation, which is appropriate. However, \"adjusted specially\" is a bit awkward and could be improved to \"special adjustments.\"\n4. **Fourth Translation**: This is very close to the original in structure and uses \"remuneration\" and \"governance committee\" correctly. However, it uses \"receive special adjustments\" which is slightly less formal than \"subject to special adjustments.\"\n5. **Fifth Translation**: This is fluent and accurate, using \"Financial Secretary\" and \"governance committee\" correctly. It also includes \"HKMA\" and uses \"receive special adjustments\" which is acceptable. However, it omits \"through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and instead says \"consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is slightly less precise.\n6. **Sixth Translation**: This version is accurate and uses \"Financial Secretary\" and \"governance committee\" correctly. It also includes \"through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"outcome of the financial industry salary survey,\" which are precise. However, \"salary of individual employees\" is slightly less formal than \"remuneration of individual employees.\"\n**Reasoning for the Best Translation**:\nThe best translation should use the exact terms from the dictionary, be fluent, and maintain the formal tone of the original. It should also accurately reflect the process described in the original text, including the role of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in seeking advice from the governance committee.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation would use \"Financial Secretary,\" \"remuneration,\" \"governance committee,\" \"independent human resources consultancy,\" and \"special adjustments.\" It should also include the phrase \"through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" to reflect the original structure accurately.\n**Improved Translation**:\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the remuneration of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, seeking advice through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and considering recommendations from its governance committee, as well as the committee's assessment of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey in the financial industry conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual employees with outstanding work performance may also be subject to special adjustments to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed remuneration or disbursing variable remuneration to individual employees based on their work performance; the variable remuneration system for professional investment personnel is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed remuneration or disbursement of variable remuneration for employees at the level of Assistant Chief Executive or above are approved by the Financial Secretary after taking into account the feedback from the Governance Committee; such employees will be excused from meetings when their remuneration proposals are discussed. For employees at the level of Director and below, adjustments to fixed remuneration or disbursement of variable remuneration are decided by the HKMA Governor, based on the lump sum approved for remuneration payments, under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Senior Executive Remuneration\n# Senior Executive Remuneration\n\nTable 2 lists the remuneration data of senior executives in 2016.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual remuneration of employees with less than one year of service will be calculated on an annualized basis to determine the average annual remuneration for the relevant position. 2. The number of personnel listed in this table includes employees with less than one year of service. The number of senior assistant presidents includes the president of Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited. 3. Other benefits include the mandatory provident fund, medical and life insurance, as well as annual leave accumulated within the year. These benefits vary according to the service conditions of individual senior personnel.\n"}

意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Exchange Fund\" when using the dictionary's preferred terms. The junior translators have mostly provided accurate translations, though there are some minor differences in formatting and capitalization.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: \"Foreign exchange fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms \"foreign exchange\" and \"fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Lacks the hashtag (#) and capitalization used in the original, which may be important for formatting or branding purposes.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: \"# Foreign Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms and includes the hashtag, matching the original's formatting.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted. This is a strong translation.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: \"Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Exchange\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Omits \"foreign,\" which is part of the dictionary's \"foreign exchange\" term. This could lead to ambiguity, as \"Exchange Fund\" might be interpreted in different ways.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: \"# Foreign Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Matches the second translation, which is accurate and well-formatted.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: \"# Foreign Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second and fourth translations.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: \"# Foreign Exchange Fund\"**  \n   - **Strengths:** Same as the second, fourth, and fifth translations.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None noted.\n**Reasoning for the best possible translation:**  \nThe most accurate and well-formatted translation is \"# Foreign Exchange Fund,\" as it uses the dictionary's preferred terms and matches the original's structure. The hashtag is likely important for consistency with the original, and \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is the most precise and unambiguous translation of \"外匯基金\" using the provided dictionary. \"Fund\" is capitalized here to match the original's likely intent, especially if this is a title or heading.\n**Final Translation:**\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original title, \"# 審計署署長報告,\" translates to \"Audit Office Director's Report\" or \"Auditor General's Report,\" depending on the specific title used in the jurisdiction. The dictionary provides the following mappings: \"報告\" should be translated as either \"report\" or \"Report,\" \"長\" as \"long-term,\" and \" \" as an empty string.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:** \"Report by the Director-General of the Audit Office\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Director-General,\" which is a formal and appropriate title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Director-General\" may not be the standard title for the head of an audit office in all jurisdictions. Also, the dictionary does not include \"Director-General\" as an option for \"長.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:** \"Audit Office long-term Report\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"long-term\" as per the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Misinterprets the structure of the title. \"長\" does not mean \"long-term\" in this context; it refers to the head or director of the office. The placement of \"long-term\" is also incorrect.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:** \"Auditor General's Report\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Auditor General,\" which is a standard and widely recognized title for the head of an audit office.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The dictionary does not include \"Auditor General\" as an option for \"長,\" but it is a more accurate and commonly used term than \"Director-General\" or \"Director.\"\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:** \"# Report by the Auditor General\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Auditor General,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of a hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary and does not match the original text, which only includes the title without formatting.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:** \"Report of the Auditor General\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Auditor General,\" which is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The preposition \"of\" is less common in formal titles than \"by\" or \"'s.\"\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:** \"# Audit Office Director Report\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Director,\" which is a plausible title.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The use of a hashtag \"#\" is unnecessary, and \"Director\" is not the most precise or commonly used title for the head of an audit office.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe most accurate and natural translation would be \"Auditor General's Report.\" It uses \"Auditor General,\" which is a standard and widely recognized title for the head of an audit office. It also correctly uses the possessive form \"'s\" to indicate the report belongs to the Auditor General. The hashtag \"#\" is not needed, as the original text does not include it. The term \"長\" is best translated as \"Auditor General\" rather than \"Director\" or \"Director-General,\" as it is more precise and commonly used in this context.\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary (FS)\n\n# Feedback\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") listed on pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheets of the Foreign Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and cash flow statements for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, and they truly and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted a critical review of the six junior translations and identified several key areas for improvement. \nFirst, all translations correctly use the dictionary terms where applicable, such as \"auditor,\" \"independent,\" \"adequate,\" and \"audit evidence.\" However, there are inconsistencies in the translation of \"條例\" (ordinance), with some using \"Ordinance\" and others using \"Bill\" or \"Regime,\" which is incorrect. The correct translation is \"Ordinance\" or \"Ordinances.\"\nSecond, the term \"審計署\" (Audit Department or Audit Commission) is inconsistently translated. Some translations use \"Audit Department,\" while others use \"Audit Commission.\" Based on the context and common usage in Hong Kong, \"Audit Department\" is more appropriate.\nThird, the term \"行政長官\" (Chief Executive) is consistently translated as \"Chief Executive,\" which is correct.\nFourth, the term \"外匯基金條例\" (Exchange Fund Ordinance) is correctly translated in most translations, though one used \"Foreign Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is unnecessarily wordy and not standard.\nFifth, the term \"審計師\" (auditor) is correctly translated as \"auditor\" or \"auditors\" in all translations.\nSixth, the term \"責任\" (responsibility) is translated as \"responsibilities\" or \"responsibility,\" which is appropriate.\nSeventh, the term \"報告\" (report) is translated as \"report\" or \"Report,\" with capitalization varying. It is more natural to use lowercase unless it is the title of a specific document.\nEighth, the term \"意見\" (opinion) is translated as \"opinion\" in most translations, which is correct. However, one translation used \"feedback,\" which is not appropriate in this formal context.\nNinth, the term \"履行\" (fulfill) is translated as \"fulfilled,\" \"honoured,\" or \"discharged,\" all of which are acceptable, though \"fulfilled\" is the most natural in this context.\nTenth, the term \"準則\" (standards) is translated as \"standards\" or \"auditing standards,\" which is correct.\nEleventh, the term \"審計憑證\" (audit evidence) is correctly translated as \"audit evidence\" in all translations.\nTwelfth, the term \"基礎\" (basis) is translated as \"basis\" or \"infrastructure,\" with \"basis\" being the correct choice in this context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would use \"Audit Department\" for \"審計署,\" \"Ordinance\" for \"條例,\" \"auditor\" for \"審計師,\" and \"opinion\" for \"意見.\" It would also maintain consistent capitalization and use natural English phrasing.\nI have now produced the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text into English, following the guidelines and incorporating the improvements identified in the review. Here is the final translation:\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Department. The responsibilities I must assume based on these standards are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities Regarding the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in line with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is adequate and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are most significant in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters in the audit of the overall financial statements and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Audit Office Director's Report (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle related matters during the audit?\nThe original question is \"我在審計中如何處理有關事項,\" which translates to \"How should I handle related matters during the audit?\" The dictionary provides specific translations for the characters \"中,\" \"處,\" and \"事項.\" \nThe first junior translator's translation, \"How should I handle related matters during the audit?\" is accurate and fluent. It uses \"related matters\" for \"有關事項\" and \"during the audit\" for \"在審計中.\" This translation is natural and grammatically correct.\nThe second junior translator's translation, \"How do I handle the relevant matters in the audit?\" is also accurate. It uses \"relevant matters\" for \"有關事項\" and \"in the audit\" for \"在審計中.\" However, \"in the audit\" is slightly less natural than \"during the audit\" in this context.\nThe third junior translator's translation, \"How do I handle the matters during the audit?\" is grammatically correct but lacks the nuance of \"related\" or \"relevant\" in \"有關事項.\" This makes the translation slightly less precise.\nThe fourth junior translator's translation, \"How should I handle the matters during the audit?\" is similar to the third but uses \"should\" instead of \"do,\" which is more appropriate for a question about proper procedure.\nThe fifth junior translator's translation, \"I remain at in matters during the audit,\" is incorrect. It misinterprets \"處\" as \"remain at\" and incorrectly uses \"in\" instead of \"related\" or \"relevant.\" This translation is not fluent and does not convey the intended meaning.\nThe sixth junior translator's translation, \"How should I handle related matters during the audit?\" is identical to the first junior translator's translation and is accurate and fluent.\nBased on this review, the best translation is \"How should I handle related matters during the audit?\" It accurately reflects the original Chinese text, uses appropriate vocabulary, and is grammatically correct and fluent in English.\nHow should I handle related matters during the audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$31,989.75 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$9,639.77 billion.\n\n95% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities are measured at the quoted price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Level 1 input), or are estimated using valuation methods, with the parameters used based on observable market data (Level 2 input).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets amount to HK$1,758.86 billion, mainly consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn light of the substantial amount involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring measures, including those related to application programmes in computer systems;  \n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If market prices are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation methods are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation methods are suitable and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation methods are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund deposits\nThe original text is \"# 未來基金存款\", which translates to \"Future Fund deposits\" when using the dictionary terms provided. The junior translators have produced several variations, with the main differences being the use of a hashtag (#), capitalization, and spacing.\nTranslation 1: \"Future Fund Deposits\" – This is grammatically correct and uses proper capitalization. However, it omits the hashtag, which may be important for formatting or categorization purposes.\nTranslation 2: \"#Future Fund Deposit\" – This includes the hashtag but uses singular \"Deposit\" instead of plural \"Deposits.\" The singular form may not be appropriate if the context implies multiple deposits.\nTranslation 3: \"# Future Fund Deposit\" – This includes the hashtag and proper spacing, but again uses the singular form \"Deposit.\"\nTranslation 4: \"Future Fund deposits\" – This is grammatically correct and uses the plural form \"deposits,\" which may be more appropriate if the context refers to multiple deposits. However, it omits the hashtag.\nTranslation 5: \"Future fund deposits\" – This is grammatically correct but uses lowercase \"fund,\" which may not be appropriate for a title or heading.\nTranslation 6: \"# Future Fund Deposit\" – This includes the hashtag and proper spacing, but again uses the singular form \"Deposit.\"\nConsidering these translations, the best possible translation would be \"Future Fund deposits\" as it uses the correct plural form and is grammatically correct. However, if the hashtag is important for formatting or categorization, then \"# Future Fund deposits\" would be the most appropriate choice.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 of the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of deposits in the fiscal reserves had to be repaid upon request, and interest was calculated based on a fixed rate set annually by reference to the past investment returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe six translations provided by junior translators are generally accurate and convey the core meaning of the original text. However, there are notable differences in fluency, precision, and adherence to the dictionary terms. Here is a critical review and reasoning for producing the best possible translation:\n**Strengths:**\n- All translations correctly identify the establishment of the Future Fund on January 1, 2016, within the fiscal reserves.\n- The mention of the initial funding from the Land Fund surplus and the regular contributions from the general revenue account is consistently captured.\n- The reference to the Financial Secretary's role in determining the amount of contributions is well represented.\n- The concept of the composite interest rate, based on a weighted average of fixed and performance-linked rates, is accurately conveyed in most translations.\n- The final clause about repaying the deposits by December 31, 2025, is consistently translated.\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Numerical accuracy:** Some translations misrepresent the amount of the initial funding. The original text states \"2,197.30億港元\" (2,197.30 billion Hong Kong dollars), but some translations incorrectly use \"21.973 billion\" or \"219.73 billion.\"\n- **Terminology consistency:** The term \"基金\" is translated as \"Fund\" in the dictionary, but some translations use \"Fund\" inconsistently (e.g., \"Future Fund\" vs. \"Future Fund’s deposits\").\n- **Fluency and clarity:** Some translations are overly wordy or awkwardly phrased, such as \"the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary\" versus the more natural \"the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary.\"\n- **Use of \"linked\" vs. \"linked with\":** The dictionary provides \"linked (with)\" and \"linked\" as options for \"掛鈎,\" but some translations use \"linked with\" inconsistently.\n- **\"Composite rate\" vs. \"composite interest rate\":** The term \"composite rate\" is used in some translations, but the original text refers to \"綜合息率\" (composite interest rate), which should be translated as such.\n**Improvements:**\n- Ensure the correct numerical value of 2,197.30 billion Hong Kong dollars is used.\n- Use \"Fund\" consistently for \"基金\" and \"Future Fund\" for \"未來基金.\"\n- Use \"linked\" or \"linked with\" consistently for \"掛鈎.\"\n- Use \"composite interest rate\" instead of \"composite rate\" for \"綜合息率.\"\n- Use \"determined by\" or \"directed by\" for \"指\" depending on context.\n- Ensure the final sentence uses \"should be repaid\" or \"shall be repaid\" consistently.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nThe Government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The Future Fund's deposits include the first tranche of funding from the Land Fund surplus (amounting to 2,197.30 billion Hong Kong dollars), as well as regular contributions transferred from the Government's general revenue account (the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary). The interest on the Future Fund's deposits is calculated based on a composite interest rate, which is determined annually on a weighted average basis, referencing the fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio mentioned above, and the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the Future Fund's deposits, together with the interest earned, shall be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nOn December 31, 2016, the Future Fund had deposits totaling HK$224.53 billion. The cumulative interest on these deposits amounted to HK$10.071 billion. Due to the large amounts involved and significant changes in deposit conditions, special attention is required regarding the measurement, presentation method, and disclosure of the deposits and the interest earned.\n\nRegarding future fund deposits, the audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and the interest earned thereon are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the method of calculating the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed rate set based on the historical performance of the investment portfolio, the annual rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite rate determined based on these two rates;\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the composite rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation method of the deposits and the interest earned thereon in the financial statements and the disclosure information.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\nThe original title, \"# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值,\" translates to \"Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1: \"Valuation of investment property accounted for at fair value.\" This is grammatically correct and fluent, but uses \"property\" in the singular, which may not be appropriate if the context refers to multiple properties.\nTranslation 2: \"Valuation of Investment Property Accounted for at Fair Value\" is similar to Translation 1 but capitalizes all major words, which may be appropriate for a title but is not standard in English for general text.\nTranslation 3: \"Fair value accounting for investment properties valuation.\" This translation is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It misplaces the phrase \"fair value accounting\" and uses \"valuation\" redundantly.\nTranslation 4: \"# Valuation of Investment Properties Recorded at Fair Value\" is mostly correct, but \"Recorded\" is not the standard term used in accounting for \"列帳.\" The correct term is \"Carried\" or \"Accounted for.\"\nTranslation 5: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\" is accurate, uses the correct term \"Carried,\" and is grammatically correct. It also uses the plural \"Properties,\" which is appropriate if the context refers to multiple properties.\nTranslation 6: \"Valuation of Investment Property Accounted for at Fair Value\" is similar to Translation 1 but uses \"Accounted for,\" which is more precise than \"Recorded\" in accounting terminology.\nBased on this review, the best translation would use \"Carried\" as it is the standard term in accounting for \"列帳.\" It should also use the plural \"Properties\" if the context refers to multiple properties. The use of a hashtag \"#\" at the beginning of the title is retained as it appears in the original text. Therefore, the improved translation is: \"Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value.\"\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$227.23 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in three associated companies and 14 joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at HK$320.83 billion. Regardless of whether the investment properties are directly held by the Group or held through associated companies or joint ventures, their fair values are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value, the audit procedures include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associate companies or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe original text is a formal statement regarding the responsibilities of a financial authority figure concerning specific documents. The dictionary provides precise translation options for key terms, and the junior translators have attempted to render the text into English, though with varying degrees of accuracy and fluency.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:** Uses \"monetary authority\" and \"Financial Management Authority\" inconsistently. The term \"Financial Management Authority\" is not in the dictionary, and \"monetary authority\" is a better fit for \"金融管理.\" The use of \"is responsible for\" is passive and less precise than \"must be responsible for.\"\n2. **Second junior translator:** Correctly uses \"Financial Management Specialist\" (though \"Commissioner\" or \"Officer\" may be more appropriate depending on context). The term \"Monetary Authority\" is used, which is acceptable. However, \"Financial Management Specialist\" may not be the best match for \"金融管理專員.\"\n3. **Third junior translator:** Uses \"Sources\" instead of \"information,\" which is incorrect. Also, \"financial management in 2016\" is awkward and unclear.\n4. **Fourth junior translator:** Uses \"Commissioner of the Monetary Authority,\" which is a strong and formal title. The structure is clear and grammatically correct. However, \"Commissioner\" may not be the exact title of the role in the original text.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:** Uses \"Financial Management Officer,\" which is a good match for \"金融管理專員.\" The structure is clear and accurate, with proper use of \"Annual Report\" and \"auditor's report.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:** Uses \"financial management professional,\" which is less formal than \"Commissioner\" or \"Officer.\" Also, \"Report\" is capitalized inconsistently.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use the most formal and accurate title for the role, ensure consistency in terminology, and maintain the clarity and formality of the original text. \"Commissioner\" is a strong and formal title that aligns with the role of a financial authority figure. \"Monetary Authority\" is the correct translation for \"金融管理.\" The term \"Annual Report\" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun. \"Auditor's report\" should be used with the possessive form to match the original.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe Commissioner of the Monetary Authority must be responsible for other information. This information includes all the information within the Monetary Authority’s 2016 Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nIn the provided translations, several strengths and weaknesses are evident. All translations capture the general meaning of the original text, which discusses the auditor's responsibility to review other information for material inconsistencies or misstatements and the absence of such reports. However, there are notable differences in fluency, grammatical accuracy, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\nStrengths include the use of appropriate terminology such as \"financial statements,\" \"material misstatements,\" and \"audit.\" The translations also maintain the formal tone appropriate for an audit context. However, some translations use \"Report\" with a capital \"R\" inconsistently, which is not ideal in formal writing unless it refers to a specific document or title. Additionally, the use of \"Sources\" in the third translation is incorrect, as the dictionary lists \"information\" or \"data\" as more appropriate terms for \"資料.\"\nThe word \"執行\" is translated as \"carried out\" or \"performed,\" which is correct, but \"execution\" or \"implement\" may be less natural in this context. The term \"報告\" is consistently translated as \"report,\" which is correct, though \"Report\" with a capital letter is unnecessary unless it refers to a specific report.\nThe phrase \"在這方面，我沒有任何報告\" is translated as \"In this regard, I have no report\" or \"In this regard, I have no reports.\" The correct translation should be \"In this regard, I have no report,\" as \"report\" is singular and refers to the absence of any such document.\nThe term \"情況\" is translated as \"circumstances,\" which is appropriate. \"責任\" is correctly translated as \"responsibility.\" \"資料\" should be \"information\" or \"data,\" not \"Sources.\" \"錯誤\" is correctly translated as \"material misstatements.\"\nImprovements would involve ensuring consistency in the use of \"report\" (lowercase), using \"information\" for \"資料,\" and ensuring that the translation flows naturally while maintaining the formal tone of an audit context.\nBased on this review, the best possible translation would be:\nRegarding the audit of the financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have already performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no report.\n\n# The original text is a formal title that outlines the responsibilities of specific committees regarding financial statements. The dictionary provides precise translations for key terms, and the task is to ensure these are used correctly while maintaining fluency and clarity in English.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Must bear\" is awkward and less formal than \"undertake\" or \"have.\" Also, the structure is slightly unclear.  \n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"financial management professional\" and \"Exchange Fund Committee\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial management professional\" is not a standard title; \"monetary authority\" or \"financial management\" would be better. Also, \"undertaken by\" is awkward.  \n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Management Commissioner\" is not a direct translation of \"金融管理專員\" and may be misleading. \"Financial management\" is more appropriate.  \n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Introduces \"Monetary Authority\" without a direct match in the original text, which may be inaccurate.  \n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund Consultation Committee\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial Management Authority\" is not a direct match for \"金融管理專員.\" Also, the structure is awkward.  \n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Foreign Exchange Fund Committee\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"Financial management professional\" is not a standard title. Also, \"have responsibilities\" is less formal than \"undertake.\"\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Use \"Audit Sub-Committee\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" as per the dictionary.\n- Use \"financial management\" for \"金融管理\" (not \"financial management professional\").\n- Use \"undertake\" for \"承擔\" to reflect the formal responsibility.\n- Ensure the structure is clear and formal, as the original is a title.\n**Improved Translation:**\nThe responsibilities undertaken by the Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Financial Management Authority regarding financial statements.\n\nThe original text outlines the responsibilities of a financial management official in preparing accurate financial statements in accordance with specific accounting standards and legal instructions. The translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary.\n**Translation 1** is largely accurate and fluent, using \"Monetary Authority Officer\" and correctly referencing the \"Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\" It also uses \"material misstatements\" as per the dictionary. However, \"Monetary Authority Officer\" may not be the most precise term for \"金融管理專員.\"\n**Translation 2** uses \"financial management specialist\" instead of \"Monetary Authority Officer,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"Exchange Ordinance\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance,\" which is incorrect. The term \"it\" is used ambiguously, referring to the financial management specialist, which is not clearly defined in the sentence.\n**Translation 3** has grammatical issues, such as \"monitors responsible for\" and \"implement controls as they deem necessary.\" The use of \"they\" is unclear and may refer to an undefined subject. It also uses \"Exchange Ordinance\" instead of \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\"\n**Translation 4** is fluent and accurate, using \"Financial Management Officer\" and correctly referencing the \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants.\" It uses \"material misstatements\" and \"due to fraud or error\" as per the dictionary. However, \"he or she\" may not be the best choice for an official role, as it implies a specific gender.\n**Translation 5** uses \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Monetary Authority Officer,\" which is less precise. It also uses \"Section 7\" instead of \"Article 7,\" which is incorrect in the context of legal documents. The term \"it\" is used ambiguously, similar to Translation 2.\n**Translation 6** is the most accurate and fluent, using \"Financial Management Commissioner\" and correctly referencing the \"Hong Kong Institute of Accountants\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance.\" It uses \"material misstatements\" and \"due to fraud or errors\" as per the dictionary. However, \"it\" is used ambiguously, referring to the commissioner, which is not clearly defined.\n**Improvements and Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"Financial Management Commissioner\" as per the dictionary, reference the \"Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants\" and \"Exchange Fund Ordinance\" correctly, and use \"material misstatements\" as per the dictionary. It should also avoid ambiguous pronouns and ensure clarity and fluency.\nThe final translation should be:\nThe Financial Management Commissioner must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing the internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management professional is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to continuing operations where applicable, and using a going concern basis for accounting.\n\nThe original sentence is:  \n**外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。**\n### Review of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"Audit Sub-Committee\" and \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" from the dictionary. \"Supervising\" is a good choice for \"監督.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Exchange Fund\" is acceptable, but \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" is more precise. \"Group's\" is lowercase, which is less formal than \"Group's\" with a capital \"G\" if referring to a specific entity.\n2. **Translation 2**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" (a better match for \"外匯\"), capitalizes \"Group\" appropriately, and uses \"supervising\" for \"監督.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Advisory Committee\" is correct, but \"Consultation Committee\" is also a valid alternative from the dictionary. However, \"Advisory\" is more commonly used in such contexts.\n3. **Translation 3**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of the group.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" and \"Audit Sub-Committee.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"of the group\" is less direct than \"the Group's\" and may sound slightly awkward in formal writing.\n4. **Translation 4**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Consultation Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Consultation Committee\" from the dictionary.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"Consultation Committee\" is less standard than \"Advisory Committee\" in formal contexts. Also, \"group's\" is lowercase.\n5. **Translation 5**:  \n   *\"The Audit Sub-Committee under the foreign exchange fund consultation Committee monitors the Group's financial report process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"monitor\" for \"負責監督,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"foreign exchange fund\" is lowercase, which is inconsistent with the dictionary's \"Foreign Exchange.\" Also, \"financial report process\" is less natural than \"financial reporting process.\"\n6. **Translation 6**:  \n   *\"The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Sub-Committee is responsible for supervising the Group’s financial report process.\"*  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" and \"Group’s\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"financial report process\" is less idiomatic than \"financial reporting process.\" Also, \"Exchange Fund\" is less precise than \"Foreign Exchange Fund.\"\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\n- **\"Foreign Exchange Fund\"** is the most accurate translation for \"外匯基金\" from the dictionary.\n- **\"Advisory Committee\"** is more standard than \"Consultation Committee\" in formal contexts.\n- **\"Audit Sub-Committee\"** is the correct term from the dictionary.\n- **\"Group's\"** should be capitalized if referring to a specific entity.\n- **\"Supervising\"** is more natural than \"monitoring\" in this context.\n- **\"Financial reporting process\"** is the most idiomatic and natural phrasing.\n### Final Translation:\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The original title, \"# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任,\" translates to \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" The junior translators have produced several variations, each with strengths and weaknesses.\nTranslation 1: \"The responsibility that auditors undertake in auditing financial statements.\" This is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, it uses \"responsibility\" in the singular, which may not fully capture the breadth of duties implied by \"責任\" in the original. Also, \"undertake in auditing\" is slightly awkward.\nTranslation 2: \"Responsibility of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements.\" This is concise and uses \"Responsibility\" in the singular, which may not be ideal. The phrase \"for the audit\" is slightly off; \"in the audit\" would be more natural.\nTranslation 3: \"The responsibilities an auditor must undertake regarding the audit of financial statements.\" This is more comprehensive, using \"responsibilities\" in the plural, which better matches \"責任.\" However, \"must undertake regarding\" is a bit wordy and could be more concise.\nTranslation 4: \"# Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" This is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses \"responsibilities\" in the plural, which aligns with \"責任,\" and \"in the audit\" is the correct preposition. The use of \"the Auditor\" with a capital \"A\" is appropriate if this is a formal title.\nTranslation 5: \"Auditors have responsibilities regarding the audit of financial statements.\" This is grammatically correct and natural, but it is more of a statement than a title. It lacks the formality and structure of the original.\nTranslation 6: \"Responsibilities of auditors regarding the audit of financial statements.\" This is concise and accurate, using \"responsibilities\" in the plural and \"regarding\" as the preposition. However, it lacks the formality of the original title.\nConsidering these translations, the best approach would be to use a formal title that accurately reflects the original Chinese, using \"responsibilities\" in the plural to match \"責任,\" and \"in the audit\" as the correct preposition. The use of \"the Auditor\" with a capital letter is appropriate if this is a formal title.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation of the original Traditional Chinese text is:\n**Responsibilities of the Auditor in the Audit of Financial Statements**\n\nMy target is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Material misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, may affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nIn conducting an audit in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Office, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;\n- Understand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Financial Management Officer are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I consider that there are material uncertainties, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Consultation Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline of the programme, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n"}
